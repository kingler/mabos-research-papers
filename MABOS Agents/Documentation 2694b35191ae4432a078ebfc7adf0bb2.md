**Description and Explanation:**

The TemporalReasoningAgent manages temporal reasoning tasks, considering time-based constraints and events. It ensures that the system's actions are timely and context-aware, enhancing the MAS's temporal reasoning capabilities. This agent is essential for handling scenarios where timing and sequence of actions are critical.

**Purpose and Relevance in the MAS:**

- **Time-Based Reasoning:** Handles reasoning tasks that involve time-based constraints and events.
- **Context-Aware Actions:** Ensures that actions are taken in a timely and context-aware manner.
- **Temporal Management:** Manages the sequence and timing of actions, enhancing the overall temporal reasoning capabilities of the MAS.
