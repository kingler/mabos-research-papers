# Documentation: Tactical Meta Agent

The TacticalMetaAgent bridges the gap between strategic planning and operational execution. It focuses on translating high-level strategies into actionable tactical plans. This agent enhances the MAS's tactical capabilities by:

1. Interpreting strategic directives received from the StrategicMetaAgent.
2. Developing concrete tactical plans based on these interpreted strategies.
3. Assigning specific tasks to OperationalMetaAgents for execution.
4. Adapting tactical plans in response to strategy updates.

Its role is vital in ensuring that strategic goals are broken down into manageable, medium-term objectives that guide the day-to-day operations of the system.
