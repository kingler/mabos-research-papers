# Goal Modeling: A Comprehensive Analysis

## Summary
The presentation "Goal Modeling" by Betty H.C. Cheng provides an in-depth understanding of goal modeling within the scope of requirements engineering (RE). It addresses key areas such as the definition of goals, the source of goals, types of goals, the structure of goal models, and the application of goal models in early requirements engineering. The presentation also delves into goal refinement via AND/OR structures, modeling soft goals, and integrating goal models with other modeling frameworks like Unified Modeling Language (UML) and KAOS.

### Key Components Analysis

#### 1. Main Research Question or Hypothesis
The central questions explored in this presentation are:
- What constitutes a goal, and what are the sources of goals in a system?
- How can goals be modeled effectively?
- Why and when should goal models be used in requirements engineering?
- How do goal models integrate with other modeling languages such as UML?

#### 2. Methodology Used
The methodology comprises theoretical exposition and practical illustrations, including exercises and examples, particularly using the Meeting Scheduler as a running example. The presentation employs:
- Definitions and classifications
- Hierarchical goal structuring (AND/OR refinement)
- Exercises to prioritize and identify goals
- Integration strategies with other models (UML, KAOS, i* framework)

#### 3. Key Findings and Results
- **Definition and Types of Goals**: Goals are outlined as stakeholder objectives, categorized as functional (hard) and non-functional (soft).
- **Goal Structuring**: Goals can be decomposed into sub-goals using AND and OR relationships.
- **Soft Goals**: Soft goals are evaluated against alternative solutions to provide qualitative assessment using positive and negative contributions (+, ++, -, --).
- **Integration**: The presentation demonstrates the synergy between goal models and other RE frameworks (KAOS, i*), illustrating clear interdependencies and rationale behind goals.

#### 4. Conclusions Drawn by the Authors
Goal models are pivotal in early requirements engineering due to their ability to:
- Capture rationales behind requirements.
- Identify stable information.
- Guide requirement elaboration by focusing on stakeholders' objectives.

#### 5. Implications of the Research
The implications underline the foundational role of goal models in designing robust and adaptive systems. The structured hierarchical approach to capturing requirements ensures that high-level objectives are systematically linked to functional requirements, thus providing a grounded basis for system design and implementation.

## First-Principle Analysis

### Fundamental Concepts
1. **Goal Definition**: A stakeholder's objective for the system, encapsulating both software and its operational environment.
2. **Goal Hierarchy**: Relating high-level goals to low-level system requirements creates a structured framework for requirement analysis.
3. **Soft Goals**: Evaluated qualitatively, they provide insight into non-functional requirements and system quality attributes.

### Methodology Evaluation
The methodology employs a mix of theoretical underpinnings and practical exercises, effectively supporting the research questions:
- **Exercises and Examples**: Practical goal ordering and identification exercises help in understanding the priority and nature of goals.
- **AND/OR Refinement**: Provides a clear visualization of how sub-goals achieve higher-level goals.
- **Integration with KAOS and i***: Demonstrates robust linkage between goal models and other RE models, emphasizing comprehensive requirement capture.

### Validity of Claims
1. **Goal Classification**: Clearly distinguishes functional from non-functional goals using well-known examples and definitions.
2. **Hierarchical Structuring**: Logical AND/OR refinement is an established method in systems engineering, validating its role in goal modeling.
3. **Soft Goal Modeling**: Using contribution graphs (+, -, ++, --) is a sound approach for qualitative assessment of non-functional requirements.

### Alternative Explanations or Interpretations
While the presentation covers comprehensive ground on goal modeling, the following considerations could provide additional depth:
- **Dynamic Goal Prioritization**: Real-world systems often require dynamic reprioritization of goals based on stakeholder feedback and evolving requirements.
- **Complexity Management**: Addressing scalability concerns when dealing with large goal hierarchies could amplify the methodology's applicability.

## Critical Assessment

### Strengths
1. **Structured Approach**: The clear, hierarchical structuring of goals helps elaborate complex systems systematically.
2. **Comprehensive Integration**: Demonstrates seamless integration with other RE frameworks, enhancing the model's utility.
3. **Focus on Early RE**: Emphasizes capturing requirements early in the design phase, preventing costly changes later.

### Weaknesses
1. **Scalability**: The methodology may encounter challenges when applied to very complex systems with vast numbers of interacting goals and sub-goals.
2. **Tool Support**: Limited discussion on automated tools for goal modeling, which can aid in managing complex goal structures.
3. **Dynamic Requirements**: The static nature of initial goal models may not fully address evolving stakeholder needs and system environments.

## Future Research Directions
1. **Automated Goal Modeling Tools**: Development of sophisticated tools to aid in the creation, refinement, and validation of goal models.
2. **Dynamic and Adaptable Goal Modeling**: Enhancing methodologies to accommodate dynamic changes in requirements and stakeholder priorities.
3. **Scalability and Performance**: Addressing scalability of goal models in large-scale systems with complex interdependencies.
4. **Integration with Emerging Frameworks**: Exploring synergy between goal models and newer RE frameworks and methodologies.

## Conclusion
Betty H.C. Cheng's presentation "Goal Modeling" provides a foundational understanding of goal models in requirements engineering. By defining goals, structuring them hierarchically, and integrating them with established RE frameworks, it offers a robust approach to capturing and elaborating system requirements. Despite certain limitations in scalability and dynamic adaptability, the methodologies outlined are solid and contribute significantly to the field. The research has profound implications for designing resilient, goal-oriented systems that meet stakeholder objectives effectively. Enhancing tool support and addressing dynamic requirements can further refine the approach, paving the way for more adaptive and scalable goal models in the future.
