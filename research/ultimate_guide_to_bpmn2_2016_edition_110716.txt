Why  BPMN  Matters
Business Process Model and 
Notation 2.0 (BPMN  2) is one of 
the best thing s to happen in  
Business Process  Management  
(BPM)  in a long time.  
Finally , both the business and 
technical sides of the 
organization can share a 
common language –  
something that they can both understand and that meets 
their respective needs for 
precision and flexibili ty. 
This shared language is empowering new ways of 
working together – and it results in the 
deployment of new and more flexible 
applications.  
At Bonitasoft, the leading provider of open 
source BPM solutions, we are mindful of the power and potential of sha red standards. 
BPMN 2.0 is a natural fit with what we do.  
 
We realize that many people and organizations who could benefit from BPMN 
have yet to give it a try.  
It may be that you’ve been putting it off under the mistaken assumption that you 
need to be an expert to use BPMN. Or it may 
be because the standard itself, and many of the things written about BPMN, are  a bit 
unwieldy and hard to dissect.  
In fact, BPMN is much simpler than you might think; expertise comes over time – but 
starting is actually pretty  easy. And we 
believe the benefi ts can become quickly 
apparent.  In fact, the nice thing about BPMN is that it is 
so structurally sound that once you master 
the Basic BPMN level elements, your knowledge and capability will improve quickly; you’ll learn what  you need from the 
intermediate BPMN level elements for extending the model, and the technical team will pick up the advanced BPMN level to com plete the execution capability.  
We offer this Ultimate Guide to help you to get familiar with the basics and give  BPMN a 
try. 
We are convinced you will find it powerful, adaptable and remarkably easy. Whether 
you are a business professional or a 
developer, BPMN2 is your path to better processes, improved management, and more efficiency.

What is BPMN ?

The ABC’s of BPMN
If you’ve heard of BPMN but 
aren’t really sure what it is or 
what it does, you are not alone.  
But, before we talk about what BPMN 
is, let’s talk about what it is not...  
It is not a “system.”  
You can’t “buy” a BPMN – it is a standard for 
business process collab oration and for IT 
development.  
It is not  just for business or just for IT  – it is a 
shared, common language.  
It is not only for experts . 
 
If you are at all familiar with 
flow charting, you can dive in 
immediat ely. 
 
 
 Definitions  
BPM  – Business Process Management  
The discipline of managing processes as 
the means for improving business 
performance outcomes1. 
BPMN  – Business  Process Model and 
Notation  
A graphical r epresentation for specifying 
business processes in a business process 
model2. 
BPMS  – Business  Process Management 
Suite 
Application infrastructure to support 
BPM projects and programs… from 
process discovery, definition and de sign 
to implementation, monitoring and 
analysis, an d through ongoing 
optimization1.

 BPMN = BPM + N  
A business process  model is a representation 
of an organization’s processes. A mode l can 
be analyzed and improved.  
Notation consists of graphic symbols to 
represent action, flow, or behavior of a 
proces s. 
In a BPMS, BPMN notation represents coding 
instructions that are executable.  
BPMN provides a notation that can be readi ly 
understandable by all users:  
• from the business analyst who model s 
the process conceptually,  
• to the technical developers responsible for implementing the technology for 
the process,  
• to the people who will  manage and 
monitor the process .

A means for  business & technical collaboration
BPMN provides a way to quic kly 
diagram business functions.  
Use it  to draw a process graphically  
The visual model will be translated quickly 
and easily into soft ware that will run the 
process.  
With BPMN, business people c an define what 
they want, simply but with a high degree of 
precision; and IT professionals can 
communicate with each other and with business people about the mode l in a clear, 
common framework.  BPMN works for any kind of management, operation and support process. By developing a model with BPMN, you can collaboratively improve communications 
with decision makers about the nature and 
health of a process; you can collaboratively initiate improvements –  and you can 
collaboratively move toward automating 
those  improvements.  
 
Source: Business Process Model and Notation, Version 2, 
January 2011 by OMG  BPMN may look familiar  
BPMN has been around for almost a decade and much in BPMN2 remains from the 1.0 
version, especially the shapes and symbols.  
One thing that has changed “behind the 
scenes” is the adoption of XML interchange 
format and the support BPMN 2.0 provides for turning a model and its notation into an executable process.  
Open source and proprietary BPM vendors now have the capacity to take BPMN 2.0 
inpu t and turn it into process automation.  
BPMN is not an execution 
language  
It is designed to be “consumed” by 
process engines and made into 
executable processes .

BPMN in 4 categories  
The BPMN2 spec is long, dense 
and relatively complex . 
We can approach it by organizing BPMN 
elements into a few general categories.  With just a few elements from first three 
categories you can draw a business process diagram and begin to build and understand a process.  
Let’s look more closely at what they 
represent.

Workflow  
Workflow includes activities, 
gateways, events, and the sequence flow that connects 
them.  
Each of these elements have several types, 
and all of these types can be connected in a 
sequence.  
Activities  
Tasks that are performed in the process –  
by humans, by automation, or that 
activate subprocesses  
 
 
  
 
  Events  
Used to start or end a process, and to 
manage specific actions during a 
workflow; it triggers or is the result of 
something external of the process flow  
 
Event  
 
Sequence flow s

Organizing
Organizing uses  pools and 
swimlanes. Think of these as the 
container for the process flow.  
 
 
 Pool s 
Contains a single, complete process. 
Workflow cannot leave a pool -  we need 
to transfer action or data from one 
pool/process to another using other 
means.  
 Swimlane s 
Used to help organize the process based 
on who does what (actors). In a lap pool, 
swimlanes keep the swimmers from 
crashing into one another.  
Workflow crosses swimlane  boundaries 
as if they did not exist –  they are purely 
for organizational clarity.  
10 The Ultimate Guide to BPMN 2  
 
      
 

  
Readability
Readability includes annotations 
and links.  
These elements help make a model readable. 
They h ave no effect at all on the actual 
process flow.  
 
 Text annotation s 
Allow you to paste notes all over a model 
with explanations for clarity (a great tool 
for beginning modelers!)  
 
 Links  
Allow you to cut a process that has 
become too long to read easily, and 
simply continue the process on another 
line in the same pool . 
 
Throw link   
Catch link  
11 The Ultimate Guide to BPMN 2  
 
      
 

  
Special behavior  
Special behavior includes a 
specific set of events  and task 
markers . 
These elements allow us to design 
executable workflow that can behave in complex ways.  
Messages and message flow  
Used to transfer data from one 
pool/process to another and to correlate 
related processes  
Correlation is used to coordinate 
progress between two running process 
instances  and match message events  
 Signals  
Used to broadcast information to other 
processes  
 
Throw signal   
Catch signal  
 
Timers  
Used to launch periodic activities, or to 
ensure that an activity happens within a 
specified deadline  
 
Timer  
  
 
  Errors  
Used to define behavior when the system 
encounters error  
 
Error  
 
Loop and multi -instance  
Used to repeat tasks , such as multiple 
launches of the same task (multi-
instance ) or repeating the same task 
(loop )

BPMN at 3 levels of complexity  
BPMN symbols serve a dual 
purpose.  
They visually represent a process flow.  
They translate to executable code that allows 
a visual process model to be executed as an 
application.  
Recall that we can organize BPMN modeling elements into a few general categories:  
 Workflow  
 Organizing  
 Readability  
 Special behavior  
 
Note that Basic BPMN is predominately 
visual . Intermediate and Advanced 
BPMN becomes executable . Let’s look at these BPMN elements at the three levels of complexity:  
Basic, Intermediate and Advanced . 
 Basic  Intermediate  Advanced  
Activities  Abstract  Human  
Service  
Call  
Events  Start

Basic BPMN  
Basic BPMN is useful for modeling 
when details have not been 
worked out.  
Activities, events, gateways, and sequence 
flow all have Basic BPMN level versions.  
 Abstract activity  
No specific execution, acts as a placeholder for documentation purposes . 
 Start event  
Begins a process flow.  
 End event  
Ends a process flow.  
 Parallel gateway  
All inputs must be received (in any order) before the process can continue.  
All outputs are activated – process continues 
in parallel.  
 Exclusive gateway  
Only one input is needed for the process to continue.  
Only one output is activated  – a condition is 
needed to determine which one.  
 Sequence flow  
Directs process flow from activity to activity.  
 
 
15 The Ultimate Guide to BPMN 2  
 
      
 

  
An example with basic BPMN  
Start with the basics: abstract 
activity , start and stop events , 
gateways , and sequence flow . 
For example, a generic new employee 
orientation and training process modeled in basic BPMN elements looks like this.  
Imagine a token being moved through 
the diagram –  like a traditional board 
game.  
This can help clarify how the features of 
the model control the movement of the 
token as you add complexity.  
When a start event is triggered, a new 
“instance” of a process begins. Think 
through wha t happens to a single token 
traversing a single pathway at a time.

Intermediate BPMN
To make a visual model 
executable, begin to apply intermediate BPMN.  
In an executable process, the flow model 
becomes an actual process application!  
As you advance with BPMN, begin making your BPMN “executable” –  to ultimately turn 
it into an automated process.  
BPMN 2.0 is not just a notation. Implemented through a BPMN modeling 
tool, it provides programming instruction that a process engine uses to execute the 
process.  
The previous example is a simple model that clearly shows visually what happens in the 
process.  
The example on this page and the next shows 
how the model is extended as you begin to 
apply intermediate BPMN.  
 
New employee orientation and training process  
Note that activities have been defined, and default flow has been added
 
17 The Ultimate Guide to BPMN 2  
 
      
 

  
Intermediate BPMN: activities  
Intermediate -level activities 
include human , service , and call 
activity . 
Activities need to be differentiated –  is each 
task performed  by a person, is it automated 
or, is it a subprocess in its own right?  
 Human activity  is a step that 
must be done b y a person  
 Service activity  is an 
automated step  
 Call activity  represents a 
subprocess  
“Prepare training schedule” is a call activity. 
It is linked to a subprocess (a “child” of the 
original parent process).  
At this point in the process, the “token” is 
passed to the subprocess, and when it has 
completed its passage, it is passed back to 
the parent process.  
This is a super -useful aspect of BPMN.  Using this notation, you can model a top -
level parent process that can be quite simple. 
It can call a series of subprocesses that are entirely independent workflows.  This means they can be modeled 
independently and modified as needed 
without necessarily changing the parent process.  
18 The Ultimate Guide to BPMN 2  
 
      
 

  
Intermediate B PMN: sequence  flow s 
Intermediate -level sequence flow 
includes conditional  and default  
flows.  
Basic sequence flow is simply automatic (as 
soon as an activity is completed, the process moves to the next task in the sequence).  
When connected to Exclusive  or Inclusive  
gateways, sequence flows need to be defined as conditional or default, so the “flow token” 
knows which path to follow.  
Conditional sequence flow  
Some specified condition(s) must be met so 
the process can “choose” th e next task from 
among two or more options.  
Conditional flow is what it sounds like: an IF-THEN condition is defined. In this (Boolean) example:  
• If the schedule is ok with the trainer, 
this condition = true.  
• If the schedule is NOT ok with the trainer, this  condition = false.  Default sequence flow  
Default flow allows you to direct flow if, for 
some reason, no conditions are met. The flow token always has a direction to take.  
Default flow is marked with a \  Sequence flow can’t cross a pool 
boundary.  To commu nicate between 
pools (processes), use messages or 
signals.  
19 The Ultimate Guide to BPMN 2  
 
      
 

  
Intermediate BPMN: gateways  
The intermediate -level gateway 
inclusive  offers finer control of 
process flow.  
 Inclusive gateway  
Outputs from inclusive gateway  
The inclusive gateway can fire multiple 
outputs simultaneously.  
It supports conditions on the outgoing sequence flows.  
Example:  
Variable  Value  
amount  5000  
color  red 
In this example, flows 2 and 4 meet the flow 
condition. Flows 1 and 3 do not – so no token 
passes.  Inputs to inclusive gateway  
The inclusive gateway waits fo r all incoming 
inputs (tokens).  
 
  
All valid inputs  (i.e., flows 2 and 4)  must be 
received before the process flow can 
conti nue.

Intermediate BPM N: events  
Events are either throw  or catch 
events.  
Mastery of  the different  start, end, and in -
flow “intermediate” events is key to mastery 
of intermediate BPMN.  
BPMN events are either  “throw” (think of 
these as senders) or “catc h” (th ink of these 
as receivers ). 
 Solid – throws  or sends events  
 Empty – catches  or receives events  
The following colors are used as a 
convenience (non- normative):  
 Start event  (catch), starts a 
process. It must have at least one 
outgoing sequence flow.  
 Intermediate event  (catch or 
throw) , takes place within the flow 
of a process . It must have at least 
an incoming and an outgoing 
sequence flow.   End event  (throw), ends a process 
flow. It must have at least one 
incoming sequence flow.  
 
 
Start    
 
End 
 
Start 
message   
Catch 
message   
Throw 
message   
End 
message  
 
Start 
timer

signal  
 
 
Catch 
link  
Throw 
link  
 
Start 
error   
Catch 
error   
 
End 
error  
   
 
Terminate  Message , signal  and error  start events allow 
you to trigger processes without direct 
human interaction, as they are set to “catch” information sen t from elsewhere.  
“Elsewhere” can mean from a throw event somewhere in another process, and this can be an end event.  
In this case, the end of one process can trigger the start of another process.  
Timers  too can start processes automatically, 
by triggering at pre -set intervals.
21 The Ultimate Guide to BPMN 2  
 
      
 

  
Intermediate BPMN: messages and signals  
Messages and signals  carry 
information across pool 
boundaries.  
Messages send to single receivers, while 
signals broadcast widely to many receivers.  
 
Message  
You can start a process with a message. In BPMN, message is specifically defined as the 
means by which da ta can be transferred 
between processes.  
With BPMN you can start a process with data 
received from a different process.  
And conversely, if you want to send data to 
another process, use an intermediate send 
message (anywhere in the process flow) or an end m essage.  
 
Signal  
Like messages and errors, signals can be caught from els ewhere and can start a 
process.  
A single “throw” signal is broadcast widely 
and can be received by multiple catch signals. 
This is useful when you want multipl e actions 
to be triggered.
22 The Ultimate Guide to BPMN 2  
 
      
 

  
Intermediate BPMN: timers and errors  
Timers  can delay or pause a 
process, while errors  send it on an 
exception path.  
Like other intermediate events, timers and 
errors can start a process –  or impose an 
action  within the process flow.  
Errors can also end a process.  
 
Timer  
Timers can be set to “go off” at specific intervals, or specific calendar -linked dates 
and times. For example, a start timer can go off every 24 hours, or on the first Tuesday of each month.  
If the timer is a start event, the process starts when the timer goes off. If the timer is located in the process flow, the process waits 
until the timer goes off –  and then it 
continues.  
 
Error  
Like messages, errors can be caught - and can 
start a process, or a special error path within 
a sub -process.

An example with intermediate BPMN

Summary  
With just 4 categories of basic and 
intermediate BPMN you can begin to build a deployable, 
executable process application.  
BPMN is a standard that allows business and 
IT to share a common language, which makes 
development of BPM applications for 
business b y IT easier and more efficient.  
BPMN is both a set of visual modeling 
elements, and a set of semantics for 
executable code represented by those elements.  
Many of the visual elements in BPMN are similar to standard flow chart elements. Modeling with and int erpreting models with 
BPMN is relatively straightforward.  BPMN elements can be categorized  
 Workflow

 Readability  
 Special behavior  
There are Basic , Intermediate , and 
Advanced  elements in each of these 
categories.  
• Basic BPMN  is useful for modeling.  
• Intermediate BPMN  begins to make a 
model executable.  
• Advanced BPMN  fully defines process 
behavior.
