Abstract  
This paper assesses the influence of two reports, ―The Limits to Growth‖ and ―The Global 2000 Report to the 
President —Entering the Twenty -First Century,‖ on environmental governance in the United States. Published in 1972 
and 1980, respectively, both repor ts used different methodologies to project changes to the global environment, but 
reached similar conclusions: business -as-usual economic growth was unsustainable and would lead to the collapse 
Earth‘s life -support systems in the 21st century. Relying on e ight oral interviews conducted with experienced and 
influential persons from environmental NGOs, academia, and the U.S. government, supplemented by a systematic 
literature review, this analysis finds Limits and Global 2000 had a limited influence on U.S. e nvironmental governance. 
The reports contributed to greater awareness of the need for sustainable growth, especially among environmentalists, 
the U.S. government, and the business community; introduced system dynamics and computer modeling to the 
environme ntal policymaking process; and directly catalyzed some policy development, particularly in the context of 
international environmental negotiations. Despite these achievements, Limits and Global 2000 could not catalyze 
movement toward sustainable developmen t at sufficient scale. The reports‘ recommendations were rebuffed by the 
hostile political agenda of the Reagan Administration, their proponents frustrated by policymaking tools ill -suited to 
long-term system -level decisionmaking, and their message subsume d by the drive for short -term economic growth. The 
reports‘ projections remain largely valid, but decisionmakers have long dismissed them as irrelevant.  
Keywords:  The Limits to Growth, the Global 2000 Report, Environmental Governance, United States, Projection.  
1. Introduction  
The Limits to Growth  (―Limits ‖) and The Global 2000 Report to the President —Entering the Twenty -First Century 
(―Global 2000 ‖) are widely regarded as two of the most important and influential reports of the modern environmental 
movement. In the years since their publications in 1972 and 1980, respectively, the reports  have been the subject of 
multiple retrospective analyses and  high-level conferences (e.g. Pirages and Cousins 2005; Turner 2008; the 2012 
"Perspectives on Limits to Growth: Challenge s to Building a Sustainable Planet" conference at the Smithsonian 
Institution) . Yet, these analyses focus exclusively on the contents of the reports and their accuracy, leaving unaddressed 
the nature of the reports‘ impact on environmental governance. T his paper fills that gap by investigating the character 
and extent to which Limits  and Global  2000  influenced decisionmaking on environmental  governance in the United 
States.  
After a brief methodological section, the paper presents a brief summary of the production, contents, and initial 
reception to Limits  and Global 2000 . The next section examines how the reports built awareness of the global character 
of environmental problems and the potential conseque nces of disrupting global life -support systems, inspiring leaders in 
government, civil society, and industry to incorporate sustainable development into their decisionmaking. The following 
section considers the factors that hindered the reports from cataly zing the social, economic, and political changes 
necessary to create a sustainable society. The paper concludes with an assessment of the continuing relevance and 
vitality of the issues discussed in Limits  and Global 2000 , as well as some lessons for futur e efforts to achieve

53 sustainability before the collapse of Earth‘s life -support systems.  
2. Method  
Since few decisionmaking documents cite Limits or Global 2000  explicitly, this analysis relies principally on eight oral 
interviews conducted between Decembe r 2015 and February 2016  with current or former leaders from across the 
environmental community. Interviewees are listed i n Table 1. Four additional people, three former government officials  
and one from civil society,  were invited to participate, but  did not agree to be interviewed.  The interviewees represent a 
broad range of decisionmakers and thought  leaders from environmental civil society organizations, academic 
institutions, and the executive and legislative branches of the U.S. government. The interv iews lasted between 
approximately 30 and 90 minutes and consisted of a set combination of open -ended and targeted questions.  
The interviews were supplemented by a systematic literature review of a broad range of sources, including academic 
analysis, record ed speeches, retrospective memoirs, and primary source material from the Congressional Record and 
presidential archives.

3. Limits and Global 2000 : Different Methods, Similar Conclusions  
Over the course of the 1970s, two concerns spread among the intellectual leaders of the U.S. environmental movement. 
First, it was increasingly clear that many environmental problems could only be addressed through global action (W. H. 
Meadows, 2015) . Having focused largely on domestic pollution control up to that point , the U.S. environmental 
International Journal of Social Science Studies                                                       Vol. 4, No. 8; 2016  
54 movement risked creating a ―fool‘s paradise‖ by allowi ng environmental problems to fester in the rest of the world 
(Speth, 2016) . Second,  environmentalists were  dissatisfied with the use of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to assess a 
society‘s development. They believed GDP provided an overly simplistic perspective, measuring only the quantity of 
development without capturing its qualit y, neglecting concerns like  social equity and environmental habitability (Speth, 
2014, p. 136) . GDP also ignored  the ―fundamental incompatibility between limitless growth and an increasingly small 
and limited planet‖ (Speth, 2014, p. 137) . As these concerns coalesced, ―a sense of planetary limits was palpable‖ 
(Speth, 2014, p. 137) . 
Building upon the environmental movement‘s desire f or a broader, more nuanced understanding of  the implications of 
development , Limits  and Global 2000  represent two of the most rigorous attempts to consider how the economy can be 
made to work within the ecological and resource boundaries of the planet over  the long term (Dernbach, 2015) . 
However, although Limits  and Global 2000  ask similar  question s, the reports came about in different contexts , through 
differe nt processes , and us ing different methods (Speth, 2016) . 
3.1 The Limits to Growth   
Limits  is the first study to combine system dynamics and computer modeling (Kress, 2012) , combining long -term global 
data to construct five aggregate variables describing population, food production, industrial output, p ersistent pollution, 
and consumption of non -renewable natural resources (D. H. Meadows, Me adows, Randers, & Behrens III, 1972, p. 25) . 
The researchers created a feedback -rich computer model (―World 3‖) and simulated how the five variables would 
interact well into the 21st century in twelve scenarios (Barney, 2002, p. 128) . Four of the scenarios show sustainable 
outcomes and eight outcomes where  the global system overshoots and leads to collapse. The ―business -as-usual‖ case is 
among the latter, demonstrating, ―prevailing growth policies will lead to overshoot and collapse, not [an] asymptotic 
approach to limits‖ (D. L. Meadows, 2012) . Nevertheless, the researchers repeatedly  point out that the scenarios were 
projections, not predictions , noting, ―if we [can] change some policies, not only technical policies, but social and 
cultural policies, then a different future is plausible‖ (D. L. Meadows, 2012) . 
Limits  received substantial public attention soon after its publication , in large part  due to the title‘s provocative 
assumption of limits to growth  (Dernbach, 2015; Eichbaum, 2015) . It attracted scores of news articles , and the report 
was widely read and discussed in environmental, scientific, and political communities throughout the world (Kress, 
2012; Moorman, 2016) . The report was a surprise to most people, even knowledgeable members of the environmental 
community (Hayes, 2016) . Written for the Club of Rome, a ―high -level but mysterious group ,‖ and only vetted in a 
small peer review before it s release, Limits ‘ complex and innovative analysis s eemed to come out of nowhere (Hayes, 
2016) . 
The report ―did not prove that there are limits to physical growth on a finite planet. [The authors] assumed it‖ (D. L. 
Meadows, 2012) . However, the impossibility of unlimited growth was far from a generally accepted  principle. 
Newspapers and magazines published negative attacks within days of its release, mostly from economists who called 
the report, ―utter nonsense,‖ and, ―simplistic‖ (Reinhold, 1972; Silk, 1972) . They charged  the authors  of using 
inadequate data and unjustifi ably pessimistic  assumptions about human innovation and capacity for adaptation (Nø rgå rd, 
Peet, & Ragnarsdó ttir, 2010) . These attacks inspired articles  coming to the report‘s defense, with one piece  quoting 
William Ruckelshaus, the n Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), as saying: ―The questions 
raised by the Club of Rom e are what really matter; to attack particular figures is irrelevant‖ (Lewis, 1972) . With the 
―advantage of being attacked ‖ (Hayes, 2016) , combined with the rise of environmental issues in the American political 
consciousness of the early 1970s  more generally , Limits  held news coverage fo r months , became a talking point among 
many people (Lash, 2016; Moorman, 2016) , and went on to sell over twelve million copies.  
3.2 Global 2000  
Global 2000  was initiated by order of President Jimmy Carter in his Environmental Message to Congress  of May 23, 
1977 (Barney, 2002, p. 124) . Convinced of the need to coordinate the government‘s response to interna tional 
environmental problems by Charles Warren, the n Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality  (CEQ ) (Speth, 
2014) , Carter  directed the CEQ and the Department of State to study the ―probable changes in the world‘s population, 
natural resources, and environment through the end of the century,‖ an effort that would provide, ―the foundation of our 
longer -term planning‖ (Carter, 1977 , sec. 6) . The study became  a three -year project involving 13 federal agencies, 
culminat ing in the release of a three -volume report on July 24, 1980 (Barney, 2002, p. 124; Speth, 2016) . 
Like Limits , Global 2000  also used c omputers to develop trend projections using long -term global data, but it used a 
higher level of detail and more rigorous assumptions (Dernbach, 2015) . Instea d of agglomerating data into a small set of 
granular variables, Global 2000  took long -term sectoral models already in use  by different government agencies, 
harmonized their assumptions, and created feedback loops between sectors (Barney, 2002, p. 124) . This amalgamated 
―Global Model‖ allowed the government to present internally consistent projections  of world trends in population, 
International Journal of Social Science Studies                                                       Vol. 4, No. 8; 2016  
55 resources, and the environment (Barney, 1980, p. v) . 
Global 2000  was an ―insider project‖ involving dozens of people, and its organizers attempted to build consensus for 
the report‘s conclusions acros s its various  constituencies (Hayes, 2016) . This collaborative process meant that, even 
though the report was drafted within six months, the review process took two ye ars (Barney, 2002, p. 124) . The 
unreliable nature of the Government‘s models contributed to the delay, but it was largely the product of hostile 
reviewers who would have liked to ―emasculate‖ the study by altering its findings (Barney, 2002, p. 124) . The White 
House public relations staff was particularly concerned that a report pointing to disconcerting trends and global 
problems would be just another source of bad news for the Carter re-elect ion campaign . This pressure forced the report 
authors to create fourteen  drafts of the summary report, adding an additional nine months of delay (Barney, 2002, p. 
124). 
Despite the political pressure, Global 2000  remained a ―powerful report‖ (Speth, 2014, p. 138) . The report is an early 
example of the U.S. government considering the sustainability of economic development seriously (Dernbach, 2015) , 
and it is the fi rst and only time any government has created a set of comprehensive, global -scale projections over the 
long-term (Speth, 2016, p. 201). Although not as explosive as Limits , Global 2000  did eventually sell 1.5 million copies, 
a considerable quantity for an environmental report (Speth, 2016 ). 
Despite the significant methodological differences between the two reports, nothing in Global 2000  contradicts Limits  
(Barney, 2002, p. 124; Speth, 2016) . Global 2000 ‘s conclusions echo those of Limits , with projections  that suggest, ―if 
present trends continue, the world in 2000 will be more crowded, more polluted, less stable ecologically, and more 
vulnerable to disruption than the world we live in now … life on for most people on earth will be more precarious in 
2000 than it is now —unless the nations of the world act decisively to alter current trends‖ (Barney, 1980, p. 1) . 
4. Positive Impacts of the Reports in Environmental Movement  
4.1 Raising  Awareness  of the Environmentalists  
Inspired by Limits , Global 2000 , and similar reports over the course of the 1970s, many ―Teddy Roosevelt -style‖ 
environmentalists , traditionally focused on local -level wilderness conservation, began  to view environmental problems 
in a broader context (W. H. Meadows, 2015; Moorman, 2016) . As remediation and prevention programs worked to  
ameliorate  most local environmental problems, the environmental movement began to discern more clearly the linkages 
between local, acute environmental problems and global issues like the pollution of the oce ans, water crises, and 
climate change (Hayes, 2016) . This systems -level approach to environmental problems within the environmental 
community, popularized by serialize d publications like the WorldWatch Institute‘s State of the World  books (1984 –
present) and the ―World Resources Report‖ series by the World Resources institute  (1986 –present) (Speth, 2016) , could 
be described as, ―think globally, apply locally, and solve nationally‖  (Hayes, 2016) . 
To many environmentalists, Limit s stated the obvious: the productive systems of Earth determine the boundary 
conditions of life (Eichbaum, 2015; Lash, 2016) . The report‘s message was even reassuring for environmentalists like 
Denis Hayes, who had reached similar conclusions and spoken publically about their convictions witho ut the support of 
rigorous analysis (Hayes, 2016) . 
What environmentalists found most exciting about Limits  was that it attempted to determine how close society was to 
exceeding the limits of Earth‘s life -support systems (Moorman, 2016) . In doing so, it provided a frame for the larger 
issue of sustainable development. Over the following decades , resource conservation and sustainable development have 
become standard topics of conversation within the environmental community (W. H. Meadows, 2015) , and the general 
public is slowly coming to accept the existence of planetary systems and the need for conservation on a finite planet  
(Moor man, 2016) . 
While Limits  got the conversation started about sustainable development, Global 2000 , through the efforts of the World 
Resources Institute (WRI) , helped power the environmental movement‘s pivot toward sustainability. After  the end of the 
Carter Administration, Gus Speth , who supervised the creation of Global 2000  as Carter‘s last CEQ Chairman,  created 
WRI as a vehicle for turning  the report‘s findings into policy outcomes (Lash, 2016) . As one of the three main 
organizations (along with the WorldWatch Institute and the United Nations Environment Programme) to drive 
sustainability into the U.S. political mind, the creation of WRI may have been the most impor tant outcome of Global 
2000  in the U.S. context (Speth, 2016) .  
4.2 Building awareness in the U.S. government  
Despite the broad popular appeal of Limits , the r eport  had a mixed reception within the U.S. Government. Although 
some may have read Limits and been influenced by its message (Moorman, 2016) , the report gained little traction 
among Congressional staff. For example, Richard Frandsen, the lead staffer on the House Energy and Commerce 
Comm ittee for 25 years, had never heard of Limits  until approached for an interview for this article  (Frandsen, 2016) . 
International Journal of Social Science Studies                                                       Vol. 4, No. 8; 2016  
56 Similarly, the Executive branch ―maintained that it had little or nothing to say about Limits  because it had no global 
study and could not prepare one because it had no global model‖ (Barney, 2002, p. 124) . Nevertheless, although Limits  
―never figured very prominently‖ in discussions between Barney and Speth when preparing Global 2000  (Speth, 2016) , 
the report‘s authors were aware of the Limits  models and compared the two studies‘ models (as well the World 
Integrated Model, as a revised version of the model used in Limits ) in the appendi x to the Global 2000 Summary Report 
(Barney, 1980, p. 45) . 
In contrast, Global 2000 ‘s message captured the attention of policymakers at the highest echelons of government. In his 
memoir, Angels by the River , Gus Speth recounts his  surprise when, toward the end of a speech to several hundred 
guests in the White House‘s East Room, Jimmy Carter ―proceeded to review, quite eloquently, a number of these threats 
[described in Global 2000 ], and concluded on an optimistic note: ‗the last d ecade has demonstrated that we can buck 
the trends ‘‖ (Speth, 2014, p. 139) . Carter continued to believe in the importance of Global 2000 ‘s message, promoting 
the report even after leaving the White House in 1981 (Shabecoff, 1983) . 
WRI‘s engagement with  Congress is a key reason  Global 2000  was able to make a significant impact in Congress. 
Despite the report‘s  relatively low profile  and technical language , many influential staffers and policymakers read 
Global 2000 , building politicians‘ awareness of the interdependency of population, resources, and environment. Some 
Congressmen even referenced Global 2000  by name in committee hearin gs (Frandsen, 2016) . WRI‘s most significant 
involvement took the form of its education program for Congressional representatives and their staff. W RI worked 
successfully with Senators Al Gore, John McCain, Lindsay Graham, and Tim Wirth, among others, to bring concerns 
about sustainability and long -term environmental trends to the forefront of the American political scene (Speth, 2016) . 
WRI‘s policy analyses also influenced decisionmakers, especially during the late 1980s and 1990s (Eichbaum, 2015) .  
In the decades following Limits  and Global 2000 , WRI‘s activities helped spread the ideas of limits to growth, the need 
to reduce the resource intensity of development, and the interconnecting dynamics of the global system (Dernbach, 
2015; Eichbaum, 2015) . These concepts are reflected in a handful of bills and resolutions that , although none became 
law, demonstrate at least some members of Congress have long appreciated the need for sustainable development and 
long-term planning . One such bill was,  ―A Joint Resolution Calling on the Executive Branch to Conform to the 
Recommendations of the Global 2000  Report,‖  introduced  by Rep. Nicholas Mavroules  in 1983 . The bill expressed the 
―sense of the Congress that the executive branch should begin to coordinate and improve its projections and analysis of 
world population, resources, and environmental trends as outlined in the Global 2000  study ‖ (Mavroules, 1983) . 
4.3 Introducing System Dynamics and Computer Modeling  
Limits , and Global 2000  to some extent, helped introduce system dynamics and computer modeling as a  means of 
providi ng decisionmakers with information about the long -term consequences of proposed policies (Dernbach, 2015) . 
The authors of Limits  used the principles of system s dynamics to pioneer ―a new technique for integrating for 
integrating economic, social, technical, environmental, and other areas of knowledge into a coherent theory,‖ and then 
used computers to develop the first sophisticated model capable of providing l ong-term projections on a global scale (D. 
L. Meadows, 2012) . 
Before the advent of computers,  decisionmakers evaluated the prospective consequences of policy decisions  through 
qualitative assessments (Lash 2016). This approach did not rely on  complex models, since  the computing power to do 
such calculations was not readily available (Dernbach  2015). Even when quantitative projections were established, 
estimates were often so imprecise as to undermine the persuasive power of the calculation (Dernbach 2015).  
4.4 Building Awareness in the Business Community  
For much of the twentieth century, most members of the business community did not place much value in 
environmental protection. When confronted with evidence of their polluting activities, corporate executives  often chose 
to ignore or refute it. Consequently, the modern environmental moveme nt acquired a strong anti -corporate edge . The 
business community was equally hostile, dismissing environmentalists as people who thought with feelings instead of 
facts (Dernbach, 2015) . 
Despite this animosity, the Club of Rome and CEQ  both had  reputations for thorough  and fair  analysis , so the business 
community was more willing to engage with Limits  and Global 2000  on their merits. For example, several corpora tions 
organized  panels and seminars  shortly after the publication of Limits  featur ing speakers who critiqued the report‘s 
methodology, but acknowledged the importance of  the topic  (Dernbach, 2015) .  
In the decades since the publication of the reports, corporations have come to see environmental protection as a 
mainstream value.  Some of this change in corporate culture is due to the integration of the principles  of corporate social 
and environmental responsibility (CSER) in the curriculums of top business schools (W. H. Meadows, 2015) . Today, 
Harvard Business School  and others make CSER courses a mandatory part of their curricula, ensuring future leaders are 
International Journal of Social Science Studies                                                       Vol. 4, No. 8; 2016  
57 aware of the need to consider social and environmental impacts of their corporate policies (W. H. Meadows, 2015) . 
Limits  itself was often us ed as a textbook in the 1970s, directly influencing the worldviews of generations of business 
leaders (Dernbach, 2015) .  
The first generation of CSER -influenc ed corporate businesspeople is now in  power today , and  environmentally -minded 
executives  are no longer a fringe  minority (Dernbach, 2015) . These decisionmaker s are more accepting of 
environmental values than their predecessors , and they are willing and capable of making decisions in the interest of 
sustainability and environmental quality. An example of such a decision is the tacit acknowledgement by oil compan ies 
that many of the oil reserves on their  company  balance sheets can never be burned  (W. H. Meadows, 2015) . 
4.5 Driving  Substantial Actions  
As described in the following section, neither Limits or Global 2000  were successful in directly inspiring the change 
their authors desired. Yet, some significant actions did take place due to the reports, mostly in regard to multilateral 
environmental agreements to which the United States is a party. Although b oth Limits  and Global 2000 were well 
received internationally, Global 2000  was influen tial in this respect  (Speth, 2016) . First, international environmental 
negotiations came to take a data -driven approach  to making the argument for environmental conservation and 
sustainability following the publication of Global 2000 (Eichbaum, 2 015). Moreover, i n the decades following the 
report‘s  publication, nearly every problem described in Global 2000  has become the subject of a major  international 
agreement (Speth, 2016) .  
This is again thanks in large part to the engagement of WRI, which was deeply involved in supporting the World 
Commission on Environment and Development (the Brundtland Commission) in the run -up to the 1992 Earth Summit 
(Speth, 2016) . In 1987, the Brundtland Commission released the report, Our Common Future , which provides the most 
commonly used definition of sustainable developmen t today (Hayes, 2016) . Brundtland also likely knew Jø rgen 
Randers, one of the authors of Limits , since Randers was the president of the largest business school in Norw ay at the 
time (Eichbaum, 2015) . 
In terms of domestic policy, t he National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) incorporates explicit consideration of 
sustainabilit y and environmental concerns into the procedural side of environmental decisionmaking (W. H. Meadows, 
2015) . Although it passed in 1970, before the publication of Limits , NEPA may be the closest Congress came to a direct 
response to the problems posed by unsustainable development  (Frandsen, 2016; Lash, 2016) . In the first few years after 
NEPA became law, several court decisions, such as  Calvert Cliffs Coordinating Committee v. U.S. Atomic Energy 
Commission  (449 F.2d 1109 (D.C.Cir. 1971))  interpreted NEPA to require the government to consider environmental 
issues at every important stage of the decisionmaking process (Dernbach, 2015) . However, two Supreme Cou rt 
decisions, Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp v. Natural Resources Defense Council (435 U.S. 519 (1978)) and 
Strycker’ s Bay Neighborhood Council, Inc. v. Karlen (444 U.S. 223 (1980)) s ubsequent ly narrowed the scope of NEPA, 
reading out the enforceability  of the law‘s  substantive requirements for sustainabili ty (Lash, 2016) . Nevertheless, NEPA, 
even in its weakened state, remains  one of the most influential environment al statutes in the U.S. , cited as the legal basis 
for nearly all federal environmental actions  (Moorman, 2016) .  
Another procedural consideration that incorporates  sustainability is the Pollution Prevention Act (PPA) of 1990. 
Informed by the Global 2000  report‘s conclusions on overcrowding, resource use, and other long -term problems, Rep. 
Howard Wolpe created the PPA with the objective of managing pollution before i t is created , rather than repairing the 
damage of pollution (Frandsen, 2016) . By regulating pollution generators, the PPA establishes ―source reduction‖ as a 
compulsory element of U.S. policymaking.  
5. Factors Hindering the Reports’ Influence  
Although Limits  and Global 2000  influenced environmental decisionmaking in the U.S. by raising awareness and 
driving action, neither achieved their princip le objective: a profound reorientation of the U.S. and global economies 
toward long -term sustainability. While most easily perceived issues of local pollution and waste have improved to the 
point that they are exceptional, the reports were unable to slow t he progression of global problems (Eichbaum  2015 ), 
leaving the core problem of  unsustainable growth unresolved (Dernbach, 2015) . 
Sustainable development has p roven a challenging concept to implement (Dernbach, 2015; W. H. Meadows, 2015) . In 
the U.S., sustainable development remains a niche consideration of economic policy (W. H. Meadows, 2015) . 
Sustainable development remains an ―environmental‖ issue, not a broader ―economic‖ objective.  As a result, most 
economists fail to fully incorporate environmental cost and resource depletion in their work (W. H. Meadows, 2015) , 
and U.S. policymakers have declined to direct development toward sustainability in any meaningful way (Dernbach, 
2015) . With the exception of occasional small victories, policymakers dismiss proposals to control unsustainable growth 
time and again in favor of unsustainable, short -term economic develo pment strategies (D. L. Meadows, 2012) .  
International Journal of Social Science Studies                                                       Vol. 4, No. 8; 2016  
58 Several quantitative analyses reveal the extent of t his dynamic. In the book, From Resource Scarcity to Ecological 
Security , Dennis Pirages and Ken Cousins review Global 2000 ‘s projections and find that, on the whole, the report‘s 
model tracks well to the current day (Pirages & Cousins, 2005) . This finding echoes the conclusions of a review of the 
projections made in Limits  (G. Turner, 2014, p. 18) . While the authors of the reports can take pr ide in the accuracy of 
their models, the projections that best fit the data assume ―business -as-usual‖ economic growth . The projections‘ 
accuracy underscores the extent to which Limits  and Global 2000  failed to ―move the needle‖ and catalyze a public 
polic y commitment for effective governance of human society (Eichbaum, 2015; Speth, 2016) . Moreover, not only are 
the limits to growth a crucial underlying cause of famine, conflict, and many other issues confronting society today, but 
―they are not recognized as such and probably never will be‖ (D. L. Meadows, 2012) . Decisionmakers have ignored the 
reports‘ insights, leading  society  into the dangerous situation of which they were warned.  The following sections 
explore the key reasons why the report‘s failed to make their desired impact.  
5.1 Confusion and Skepticism  
The persuasive power of Limits  and Global 2000  was largely limited to people predisposed to accept its conclusions 
(Hayes, 2016) . Since the reports simply assumed the existence of limits to growth (D. L. Meadows, 2012) , people  who 
did not want to hear unrestrained growth could be problematic  had the optio n of simply rejecting the reports‘ premise  
(Moorman, 2016) . Deploying vague terms like ―politicized science‖ (―Investing in America‘s Future Act of 2002,‖ 2002, 
p. H3201) , skeptics shape d public dialogue into an argument about beliefs, rather than a fact -based debate about action 
(Moorman, 2016) . The success of this tactic is clear, since the very concept of physical limits to growth is still contested 
today (G. Turner, 2014, p. 16) .  
Several sources pointed to the important role played by vested interests —people whose short -term interests were at 
odds with the conclusions of Limits  and Global 2000 —in cultivating skepticism about the existence of limits to growth. 
With great quantities of information available today , people look to certain public commentators to make the flow of 
information understandable (W. H. Meadows, 2015) . Although public figures have p rovided some criticism of Limits  
and Global 2000  (Will, 2012) , cert ain organizations, loath to incur the cost and risk of reorienting  their business models  
towards sustainable development, have amplified the voice of lower -profile skeptics to influence public dialogue , much 
in the same way Exxon funded climate change deni ers (Hasemyer & Cushman Jr., 2015; Moorman, 2016) . This 
belief -based skepticism comes from three principle sources: mischaracterization of the reports‘ findings, the ideology of 
techno -optimism, and popular mistrust of science.  
5.1.1 Projecting vs.  Predicting  
Much of the criticism directed at Limits  and Global 2000  is due to confusion over the actual contents of the reports. 
Perhaps the greatest contributor to this misunderstanding is the perception that the reports made predictions and not 
projecti ons. (Note 1)  While both reports did project possible future scenarios, neither attempted to calculate the 
likelihood of a particular scenario. To the contrary, as discussed in section 3.1, the authors took pains to describe how 
their projections were only  valid if technical, social, and cultural policies remained as they were (D. L. Meadows 2012).  
However, since ―public discourse has difficulty with subtle, conditional messages ,‖ the authors of the reports failed to 
communicate the conditional nature of th eir results effectively  (D. L. Meadows 2012). This led  to confusion about 
whether the reports‘ conclusions were based on projections or predictions  (see, e.g., ―Investing in America‘s Future Act 
of 2002,‖ 2002, p. H3201; Nør gå rd et al., 2010; Will, 2012) . This uncertainty was compounded when the biologist  Paul 
Ehrlich use d Limits ‘ projections to make short -term predictions about the prices of certain natural resources. When these 
failed to come true, the reputations of the  authors of Limits  suffered collateral damage (Dernbach, 2015) . Today, despite 
the authors‘ attempts to argue otherwise, the popular perception  of Limits  and Global 2000  is that they ―predict[ed] 
world collapse by the end of the 20th century ,‖ and, since did not happen, the reports must have been fundamentally 
flawed  (Turner 2014, 9) . 
5.1.2 Techno -Optimism  and M istrust of Science  
Techno -optimism, the belief that human adaptation can overcome all physical limits, provided another source of 
criticism of the reports (Nø rgå rd et al., 2010) . Ronald Reagan gave voice to this perspective in his Second Inaugural 
Address, arguing, ―there are no limits to growth and human progress when men and women are free to follow their 
dreams .‖  
The argument for huma n ingenuity and the capacity to substitute has also attracted considerable support within the 
environmental community (Lash, 2016) . While many environmentalists feel p hysical limits to growth exist as a serious 
and relevant issue (Eichbaum, 2015) , others believe the real focus should be on conserving the global life -support 
systems that, in the event of their collapse, would have conseq uences that go beyond the human capacity to adapt (Lash, 
2016) . Today, the latter argument is dominant within the environmental community. As such, Limits  and Global 2 000 
International Journal of Social Science Studies                                                       Vol. 4, No. 8; 2016  
59 are not rejected, but characterized as, ―the wrong way to perceive what was happening in the world,‖ and thus irrelevant  
(Lash, 2016) . 
Similar to  techno -optimism, incompatible religious beliefs , particularly those that reject the validity of scientific 
techniques as a means of discovering how the world works , provide d a third source of popular resistance to the ideas in 
Limits  and Global 2000  (Moorman, 2016) . This bears noting because, even though anti-science beliefs are held by few 
decisionmakers, the American public as a whole demonstrates  a greater degree of skepticism wh en considering 
scientific evidence  than people in most developed countries  (World Values Survey Association, 2015) . This skepticism 
diminished the persuasive power of the reports simply because they relied upon scientific reason and observation.  
5.2 The Reagan Administration  
Beyond arguments over the existence of limits to growth, Global 2000  suffered from inopportune political timing.  Due 
to the delays described in Section 3.2, the report came out in the last year of President Carter‘s  term. Although the 
President engaged publicly with the report and supported its conclusions (Speth, 2014, pp. 138 –139), he did not have 
time to take substantive action to address the findings of Global 2000  in the few months remaining in his term (Barney, 
2002, p. 125) . 
More importantly, Global 2000  became  identified with Carter and the Democratic  Party as a whole (Hayes, 2016) . 
During his 1980 election campaign, Reagan declined to describe how he would respond to Global 2000 ‘s projections  
and undermined the ori ginal rationale for the project , saying, ―Well, the response [to Global 2000 ] must take into 
consideration what we can do to predict in the long term. I don‘t think anyone could… [Projections] cannot foresee 
what is going to happen, what is going to come i n the line of technology and so forth‖ (Associated Pres s, 1980) .  
Despite hopes otherwise (see, e.g., Oakes, 1981) , the Reagan Administration proved a hostile environment for acting on 
Global 2000 ‘s warnings  (Speth, 2016) . Instead , ―the Reagan Administration tried to shred [figuratively] as many copies 
of the report as possible‖ (Lash, 2016) . A few politicians continued to push for sustainable development, but most set 
the topic  aside, fearful of comparisons to the unpopular Carter (W. H. Meadows, 2015) . Only two years after leaving 
office, Carter accused Reagan of ―a deliberate, across -the-board abandonment of United States leadershi p on 
environmental, resource, and related global issues‖ (Shabecoff, 1983) , but his  criticism fell upon deaf ears.   
Reagan‘s small government ideology did accommodate environmental protection at the local level (Hayes, 2016) , as 
well as limited federal government interventions to address acute, local -level environmental problems like hazardous 
waste (Frandsen, 2016) . But local governments  are not well positioned to address broad cross -jurisdictional 
environmental problems, since regulatory leakage forces decisionmakers to choose between jobs and environmental 
quality (Hayes, 2016) . 
In one  of the few official responses to Global 2000 , the Reagan Administration clearly distanced itself from the report‘s 
premise and conclusions :  
 ―In commenting on the Global 2000  report, this Administration in 1981 disagreed with its call for 
governmental su pervision and control … the Administration places a priority upon technological 
advance and economic expansion, which hold out the hope of prosperity and stability of a rapidly 
changing world. That hope can be realized, of course, only to the extent that g overnment‘s response to 
problems, whether economic or ecological, respects and enhances individual freedom‖ (The United 
States of America, 1984, p. 3) .  
5.3 The Challenge of Adopting a Systemic and Long -Term Approach in the U.S. Political Economy  
Beyond the technical difficulty of understanding the report and t he circumstantial obstacle of the Reagan Administration, 
the U.S. political economy poses a systemic barrier to taking broad, comprehensive action on sustainable development. 
The U.S. political system discourages holistic thinking by making it difficult for individual decisionmakers, even 
presidents, to accumulate sufficient  political capital ; it discourages long -term investments with upfront costs by having 
frequent elections; and, given the prior two challenges, decisionmakers are unlikely to use precio us resources to avoid 
future disasters so long as there is a chance they might not occur anyway.  
Political capital is particularly difficult to accumulate in regard to environmental law and policy. Responsibility for 
environmental issues is distributed am ong different congressional committees, so acting on a crosscutting 
environmental issue might require the support of four or five congressional committees  (Frandsen, 2016) . Aligning 
multiple  interests requires many compromises, so ―today‘s environmentalism tends to be pragmatic and incrementalist‖ 
(Speth, 2014, pp. 151 –152). Motivated by the need to succeed within the existing polit ical system, ambitious reform s 
are watered down through  compromise and negotiation (Frandsen, 2016) . While this strategy has led to some important 
victories, it ―locked us into patterns of environmental action that have since proved no match for the system we‘re up 
against‖ because such a piecemeal approach is ―closely allied to a tendency to deal with effects rather than underlying 
International Journal of Social Science Studies                                                       Vol. 4, No. 8; 2016  
60 causes‖ (Speth, 2014, pp. 151 –152). 
Time is also a limiting factor. T he drive for  sustainable development is a major undertaking that requires 
decision makers to opt for changes with steep upfront costs and delayed benefits (D. L. Meadows, 2012) . With elections 
every two, four, or six years, the next evaluation will come long before politicians can take credit for their actions. 
Aware of the public‘s short -term perspective (Randers, 2012)  and under pressure to use their limited political capital on 
issues voters care about, politicians  are generally unwilling to spend resources on the long -term problems of resource 
depletion and sustainability (W. H. Meadows, 2015; Randers, 2012) . Limits and Global 2000  may have even had a 
perverse effect on lawmakers by revealing the scale and duration of effort it would take to achieve sustainable 
development (Eichbaum, 2015) . 
Policymakers are also reluctant  to commit whatever  resources  they have managed to accumulate  toward addressing 
future  problems , largely  due to the uncertainty inherent to far -reaching, complex forecasts. From the Limits  and Global 
2000  models, it is clear that ―we will reach the physical limits to growth on this planet soon. What does soon mean? 
That is not something you can tell f rom our models‖ (D. L. Meadows, 2012) . Uncertainty, in regards to  timing, 
magnitude, or any o ther factor, breeds doubt and dissent, which weaken the analysis‘ capacity to inspire  change.  
With the political system geared for narrow and specific action , decisionmakers tend to focus on  relatively 
straightforward questions of policymaking, permitting , and adopting standards ; discrete problems they can solve with 
their limited political capital and use in their re -election campaigns  (Dernbach, 2015) . In th e meantime, the dispersal of 
political capital, short -term thinking, and uncertainty of projecting the future predisposes to in action, so long-term, 
systemic threats  remain unaddressed  (Frandsen, 2016)  and ―we are stuck in a system …where politics and the market 
systematically drive us over the cliff‖ (D. L. Meadows, 2012) . 
Some of those interviewed even suggest that, given the difficulty democratic systems demonstrate in establishing 
conditions favorable to long -term, systems -level decisionm aking (Eichbaum, 2015) , a technocratic approach may be 
better suited to achieving sustainable development  (Moorman, 2016) . 
5.4 Desire to p ursue unrestrained growth  
Finally, there is a fundamental incompatibility between the core message of Limits  and Global 2000 , that economic 
growth comes with costs that will only continue to rise, and the ―unquestioning society -wide commitment to economic 
growth at any cost‖ currently present in the United States (Speth, 2014, p. 153) . Given the American public‘s implicit 
respect for a ―corporat e right to profit‖ (Eichbaum, 2015) , there is little appetite to impose controls of any kind on 
economic growth, even if ―an ever -growing economy‖ will ―underm in[e] the ability of the planet to sustain human and 
natural communities‖ (Speth, 2014, pp. 153 –154). In August 2010, Jeffery R. Immelt, CEO of General Electric, 
summarized this objection , saying, ―We know the solution. But we don‘t like i t‖ (Randers, 2012) . 
Moreover, forthright acknowledgement of the limits to growth would conflict  with the public‘s desire to improve living 
standards for the less fortunate  without giving up w hat Americans already enjoy . What so unnerved people about Limits  
and Global 2000  was not the prospect of overshoot and collapse, but ―the fear that we all have now of looking in the 
eye of a person from Bangladesh, or Malawi, or Czechia, or Ghania [sic]‖ and saying, ―If [you] tried to live as well as 
[we] do, it would destroy Earth (Barney, 2002, p. 12 8).‖ When Global 2000  was being prepared, the idea of such an 
uncomfortable conversation motivated ―a relatively senior government official‖ to say to the lead author, Gerald O. 
Barney, ― Global 2000  cannot suggest that developing countries face challenges any more difficult than those faced by 
the United States‖ (Barney, 2002, p. 128) . It may have been  ―the moral challenge‖ of the conclusion, ―the challenge to 
developing countries is greater than the challenge to the United States‖  that sapped the persuasive power of Limits  and 
Global 2000  (Barney, 2002, p. 128) . 
When confronted with evidence that continued unsustainable growth would lead  to major problems, most 
decisionmakers have found it easier to deny or ignore the need to take decisive action. However, the persistent 
incompatibility between the public‘s desire for a resource -intensive lifestyle for all and environmental reality does 
oblige the advocates for ―business -as-usual‖ growth to create one rationale after another, retreating each time their 
position became untenable relative to environmental reality (D. L. Meadows, 2012) . By denying the ongoing conflict 
among  economic growth, social equity, and ecological limits, decisionmakers not only dismiss the practical relevance of 
planetary boundaries, but also defend the pursuit of unrestrained growth (Gó mez -Baggethun & Naredo, 2015, p. 393) .  
6. Discussion  and Conclusion  
This analysis has at least two limitations. First, since the interviews were semi -structured, interviewees were free to 
respond to the same questions in different ways. Consequently, some aspects of this analysis rely on the perspective of 
fewer interviewees than others. However, all interviews covered the same broad topics and the literature review 
provides additional support to sections that  were not d iscussed in multiple interviews . Second, interviewees sometimes 
International Journal of Social Science Studies                                                       Vol. 4, No. 8; 2016  
61 presented assertions that are impossible to verify independently. Although outside sources were used to support these 
statements when appropriate, content from the interviews should  be regarded as informed opinions rather than 
statements of fact.  
Despite these shortcomings, the interviewe es represent a well -balanced group of people who were and often remain 
thought leaders in the field of environmental governance. With the additional  support of primary and secondary sources, 
this study presents a robust, nuanced viewpoint on how decisionmakers perceive Limits  and Global 2000,  in terms of 
both the reports‘ influence on past environmental decisionmaking and their potential to do so i n the future.  
We concluded that Limits  and Global 2000  had an unmistakable influence on environmental governance in the U.S. The 
reports‘ most important concept, the need for sustainable development, has become the principal frame through which 
the environmen tal profession understands environmental problems (Dernbach, 2015) , inherent in the consideration of 
almost every environmental issue (Eichbaum, 2015) . The environmental movement has used the reports as a foundation, 
with Limits  a fixture on the bookshelves of many decisionmakers over the decades (Eichbaum, 2015) . Today, 
sustainable development is the core priority for WRI and several other major environmental institutes (Speth, 2016) , 
which pose the reports‘ questions with greater specificity and work with decisionmakers to make change happen on the 
ground (Dernbach, 2015; Moorman, 2016) . Over the past 40 years, environmental thinkers have ―never really lost the 
thread‖ of the reports (Dernbach, 2015) , more  and more resources  are directed  toward solving the problem of 
unsustainable development, and the ―steady dru mbeat of sustainability‖ has grown ever louder (W. H. Meadows, 2015) .  
Yet, Limits  and Global 2000  also failed. Ultimately, the reports sought to catalyze a fundamental shift in the 
development of the world economy. But  the reports were rebuffed by hostile political agendas, frustrated by 
incompatible policymaking tools, and subsumed by the unstoppable drive for short -term economic growth. Due to  a 
combination of confusion, mistrust, and outright rejection, decisionmakers today perceive Limits  and Global 2000  to be 
―largely wrong‖ (Lash, 2016) . Unable to inspi re movement toward sustainable development at sufficient scale, the 
reports did not achieve their goals.  
Indifferent to ―doomsday cries ,‖ the world has carried on much as before (G. Turner, 2014, p. 18) . Society has already 
pushed several global life -support systems beyond their limits (Steffen et al., 2015, fig. 3) , and ―The  global system is 
now far above its carrying capacity‖ (D. L. Meadows, 2012) . If Limits ‘ busi ness-as-usual projections continue to hold 
true, as they have for the past 40 years, the world will enter the early stages of global collapse between 2015 and 2025 
(G. Turner, 2014, p. 16) . 
Despite the passage of four decades, it is still too soon to determine the full impact of Limits  and Global 2000 . So long 
as the global life-support system has not passed its tipping point toward collapse, a sustainable society will remain 
possible. If the U.S.  ever realizes such a society, the reports will have played an important role in its development. If not, 
there will be bigger things to worry about.
