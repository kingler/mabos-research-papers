Users tend to organize informationwithin Lifestreams in three di/#0Beren tw a ys that all en tail the use of find and substreams/.The most common use of the /#0Cnd op eration is to create a temp orary do cumen tcollection that can b e bro wsed for a piece of relev an t information/. A go o d example ofthis is searc hing for a do cumen t on a particular topic/, for instance the /#5Clast draft of theLifestreams SIGMOD pap er/./" Suc h queries are t ypically accomplished b y p erforminga find SIGMOD and Lifestreams that results in a substream with small n um be r o fdo cumen ts

Chapter /5/. Common T asks /9/5or/, if the n um b er of do cumen ts is large/, further searc hed to lo cate the do cumen t /#28theuser ma y also mak e use of c hronology to lo cate the do cumen t/, ev en if the substreamis large/#29/.In this w a y Lifestreams allo ws bro wsing and searc hing to b e in tert wined/: the user/#0Clters his /#28p ossibly large/#29 information collection do wn in to a narro w con text in whic hto searc h for sp eci/#0Cc do cumen ts/.

W ork b y Gopal et al /#5BGKM/9/5 /#5Dh a v e noted that theset w o paradigms /#28bro wsing and searc hing/#29 ha v e b een supp orted separately b y previousinformation systems and ha v e argued that b y allo wing access to the t w o capabilities al lthe time /, users are giv en a more p o w erful to ol for /#0Cnding information/. Substreamingsupp orts this com bined paradigm naturally/: the user can bro wse his curren t streamor substream/, searc h/, bro wse again/, further re/#0Cne his searc h /#28through incremen talsubstreams/#29/, bro wse again/, bac k up/, searc h again/, and so on/.When users create substreams in this manner they t ypically destro y them afterthey/'v e lo cated /#28and p ossibly cloned or xfer/'d/#29 the do cumen t/. Our ev aluation in thenext c hapter will examine this topic further/.Another w a y users commonly use substreams is to main tain p ersisten t collectionsof do cumen ts/. F or instance if the ab o v e SIGMOD draft w as dev elop ed o v er the long/-term/, the user migh t allo w the /#5CSIGMOD and Lifestreams/" substream to p ersist /#28ratherthan immediately remo ving it/#29 so that it con tin ues to collect new do cumen ts as theyare added to the stream/. This st yle of organization directly mirrors what Barreau andNardi /#5BBN/9/5/#5D call /#5Cw orking/" information /| information that is t ypically relev an tt oan ongoing pro ject or task and is imp ortan t to the user o v er a time p erio d of w eeksor mon ths /#28w e will explore these classi/#0Ccations further in Chapter /7/#29/. In this case thesubstream of /#5Cw orking/" information for the SIGMOD pap er migh t include drafts ofthe pap er as w ell as email exc hanges b et w een the author and editors/. Barreau andNardi found that users often prefer to k eep w orking information in an easily accessi/-ble /#5Clo cation/./" Here Lifestreams sho ws a bit of the /#0Da v or of a lo cation/-based system/,but with a few di/#0Berences/: First/, information in p ersisten t substreams still remainsaccessible to other substreams/. Lik ewise/, at an y time the /#5CSIGMOD and Lifestreams/"substream can b e further re/#0Cned b y creating an incremen tal substream /#28sa yb y find/"comments or feedback/" /#29/. Last/, substreams automatically capture new informationas it is added to the stream /#28so the user do esn/'t ha v e to explicitly /#0Cle new do cumen ts asthey are created/#29/. These same tec hniques can b e used to main tain an ongoing threadof con v ersation/. W e will further explore this topic in the next section/.The last st yle of organization/, whic h is seldom used but needed in some circum/-stances/, is the creation of explicit substreams/. These substreams are similar to di/-rectories b ecause the user decides what go es in to eac h one/. Users create them b yassigning a unique k eyw ord
/2to eac h do cumen t in the substream /#28suc h as the k eyw ord/2This is curren t done explicitl y as describ ed in Chapter /4 but could b e implemen ted through a/#5Cstamping/" or drag/-and/-drop mec hanism/.
Chapter /5/. Common T asks /9/6mydissertation /#29 and then creating a substream based on that k eyw ord/. This formof substreaming can b e used to mirror an en tire /#0Cle system/. F or example/, if w ew an tto place the directory /#2Fetc in a lifestream w e can tag all of its /#0Cles with the k eyw ord/#2Fetc /, and so on recursiv ely for the en tire directory structure/.

A t the same time the /#0Cles in /#2Fetc remaina v ailable to b e found b y other /#0Cnd op erations/./5/./2 Electronic MailElectronic mail is the most prev alen t application used b y computer users and /#0Cllsav ariet y of roles b ey ond information transfer b et w een individuals /#5BWS/9/6 /#5D/. Sendingand receiving electronic mail in Lifestreams is similar to what the user is alreadyaccustomed to/: to send a do cumen t the user creates a new do cumen t and uses thetransfer op eration/. Similarly /, existing do cumen ts are easily forw arded to other users/,and do cumen ts can b e cloned and replied to/. Incoming email is automatically app endedto the stream/.While users normally handle /#5Cone/-shot/" comm unication on the main stream /#28e/.g/./, anew message arriv es and the user reads it and p ossibly resp onds/#29/, p ersisten t substreamscan b e used to monitor an ongoing thread of con v ersation and switc h bac k and forthbe t w een m ultiple con v ersational threads/. One of our lo cal users main tains an ongoingcon v ersational thread with her external thesis reader b y creating a substream withthe searc h query /"to/:suresh or from/:suresh/" /#28 to and from are tags as describ edin Chapter /3/#29/. This query uniquely captures all her mail to and from the reader/. Sheoften uses this substream as the basis for /#0Cnding more sp eci/#0Cc messages from theircon v ersation /#28suc ha s find semantics or find visit /#29/.All mail messages /#28incoming and outgoing/#29 are in termixed with other do cumen ts inthe main stream/; ho w ev er the user can easily create a mailb o xb y substreaming/. In ourprotot yp e all transferred do cumen ts are automatically tagged as email /, so the mailb o xcan b e created through find type/:email /. By incremen tally substreaming from themailb o x substream the user can create con v en tional mailb o x /#5Cfolders/./" These foldersmigh t con tain all mail from a particular user /#28or group of p eople/#29/, all mail ab out aparticular topic area/, or the mail a user has not resp onded to/. Because these foldersare substreams they also act as /#0Clters and con tin ue to collect new mail as it arriv es/.The user can also /#5Cremo v e/" email from a substream /#28or the main stream/#29 b y /#0Cnding/"not type/:email/" /. This will create a substream con taining all the do cumen ts thatare not email/. This also has the e/#0Bect of /#0Cltering out incoming email
/3/. When theuser no longer needs email to b e disabled/, he can remo v e the incremen tally createdsubstream and return to the original substream/./3As the protot yp e is curren tly implemen ted the user can/'t /#0Clter out incoming email without also/#0Cltering out old email messages that b elong to a substream/.
