The ArchiMateÂ® Specification, a standard of The Open Group, is an open and independent modeling 
language for Enterprise Architecture that is supported by different tool vendors and consulting firms. The 
ArchiMate language enables Enterprise Architects to describe, analyze, and visualize the relationships 
among architecture domains in an unambiguous way.
Just as an architectural drawing in classical building architecture describes the various aspects of the 
construction and use of a building, the ArchiMate Specification offers a common language for describing 
the construction and operation of business processes, organizational structures, information flows, IT 
systems, and technical and physical infrastructure. This insight helps stakeholders to design, assess, and 
communicate the consequences of decisions and changes within and between these architecture domains.
The main changes between Version 3.0.1 and Version 3.1 of the ArchiMate Specification are listed below:
â€¢  Introduced a new strategy element: value stream
â€¢ Added an optional directed notation for the association relationship
â€¢ Improved the organization of the metamodel and associated figures
â€¢ Further improved and formalized the derivation of relationships
In addition to these changes, various other minor improvements in definitions and other wording have been 
made.

sustenance, or operation of a more abstract entity.
Dependency Relationships Notation
Serving Represents that an element provides its functionality to another element.
Access Represents the ability of behavior and active structure elements to observe or act 
upon passive structure elements.
