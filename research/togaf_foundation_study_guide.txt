TOGAF® 9 Foundation Study Guide, 2nd Edition  1 Chapter 1 Introduction 
1.1 Key Learning Points 
This document is a Study Guide for TOGAF® Version 9 for students planning to become 
certified for TOGAF 9 Foundation. It will familiarize you with all the topics that you need to 
know in order to pass the TOGAF 9 Part 1 Examination. 
It gives an overview of every learning objec tive for the TOGAF 9 Fou ndation Syllabus and in-
depth coverage on preparing and taking the TOGA F 9 Part 1 Examination. It is specifically 
designed to help individuals prepare for certification. 
This first chapter will familiarize you with the TOGAF 9 certification program and its principles, 
as well as give you important information about the structure of the TOGAF 9 Part 1 
Examination. 
The objectives of this chapter are as follows: 
• To provide an understanding of TOGAF certifi cation and why you shoul d become certified 
• To learn key facts about the TOGAF 9 Part 1 Examination 
1.2 The TOGAF Certification for People Program 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 13, Learning Outcome 1:  You should be able to briefly explain the 
TOGAF Certification program, and distinguish between the levels for certification.) 
Certification is available to individuals who wish  to demonstrate they have attained the required 
knowledge and understandi ng of TOGAF Version 9.2 
There are two levels defined for TOGAF 9 Peopl e certification, denoted Level 1 and Level 2, 
which lead to certification at TOGAF 9 Foundatio n and TOGAF 9 Certified, respectively. This 
Study Guide covers the first of these – TOGAF 9 Foundation. Studying for TOGAF 9 
Foundation can be used as a learning objective towards achieving TOGAF 9 Certified, as the 
learning outcomes in TOGAF 9 Foundation ar e also required in TOGAF 9 Certified. 
                                                 
 
2 This second edition of this Study Guide has been updated to cover Version 2 of the TOGAF Certification for People 
Conformance Requirements, which are aligned to TOGAF Version 9.1.

 Why is TOGAF certification important? 
The existence of a certification program for TOGAF provides a strong incentive for 
organizations to standardize on TOGAF as the ope n method for enterprise architecture, and so 
avoid lock-in to proprietary methods. It is an important step in making enterprise architecture 
a well-recognized discipline, and in introducing rigor into the procurement of tools and 
services for enterprise architecture. 
The two certification levels are summarized in  Figure 1 and Figure 2. Figure 1 shows the 
relationship between Level 1 and Level 2. Level 2 (TOGAF 9 Certified) is a superset of the 
requirements for Level 1 (TOGAF 9 Foundation).3 
 
Figure 1: TOGAF 9 Certif ication Program Overview 
The Open Group also provides a certification path  direct to Level 2 (TOGAF 9 Certified) for 
individuals who have previously  achieved the TOGAF 8 Certified qualification. This is known 
as the bridging option and is illustrated in Figure 2. 
                                                 
 
3 The gap at the top of the pyramid is to signify that additional certification levels may be added in the future.

TOGAF is.) 
TOGAF is an architecture framework – The Op en Group Architecture Framework. TOGAF is a 
tool for assisting in the acceptance, production, u se, and maintenance of enterprise architectures. 
It is based on an iterative process model supporte d by best practices and a re-usable set of 
existing architectural assets.

TOGAF® 9 Foundation Study Guide, 2nd Edition  11 TOGAF is developed and maintained by The Open  Group Architecture Forum. The first version 
of TOGAF, developed in 1995, was based on th e US Department of Defense Technical 
Architecture Framework for Information Management (TAFIM). Starting from this sound 
foundation, The Open Group Architecture Forum has developed successive versions of TOGAF 
at regular intervals and published each one on The Open Group public web site. 
This document covers TOGAF Vers ion 9.1, referred to as “TOGAF 9” within the text of this 
document. TOGAF 9.1 is a maintenance update  and was published in December 2011. It 
supersedes the original TOGAF 9 that was published in January 2009. 
TOGAF 9 can be used for developing a broad range of different enterprise architectures. 
TOGAF complements, and can be used in conj unction with, other frameworks that are more 
focused on specific deliverables for particul ar vertical sectors such as Government, 
Telecommunications, Manufacturing, Defense, and Finance. The key to TOGAF is the method – the TOGAF Architecture Development Method (ADM) – for developing an enterprise 
architecture that addresses business needs. 
note
 When appropriate, this Study Guide contains references to sections within TOGAF, which are 
referred to as “the TOGAF document”. The refere nces are intended to be functional for the web 
version and printed version of the document. Th erefore, the format of the reference number 
contains both the Part and the Chapter reference,  but not the page references since they exist 
only in the printed book. 
2.2.2 Structure of the TOGAF Document 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 1, Learning Outcome 6:  You should be able to describe the structure 
of TOGAF, and briefly explain the contents of each of the parts.) 
Table 3 summarizes the parts of the TOGAF document. 
Table 3: Structure of the TOGAF Document 
TOGAF Part Summary

and Tools and store the outputs of architecture activity within an enterprise. 
Part VI: TOGAF Reference 
Models This part provides two architectural reference models, namely the 
TOGAF Technical Reference Mode l (TRM), and the Integrated 
Information Infrastructure Reference Model (III-RM). 
Part VII: Architecture Capability Framework This part discusses the organizati on, processes, skills, roles, and 
responsibilities required to establish and operate an architecture 
practice within an enterprise. 
2.3 What is an Enterprise? 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 1, Learning Outcom e 1: You should be able describe what an 
enterprise is.) 
TOGAF defines an “enterprise” as any collection of organizations that has a common set of 
goals. For example, an enterprise could be a government agency, a whole corporation, a division of a corporation, a single department, or a chai n of geographically distant organizations linked 
together by common ownership. 
The term “enterprise” in the context of “enterpri se architecture” can be used to denote both an 
entire enterprise, encompassing all of its informa tion systems, and a specific domain within the 
enterprise. In both cases, the architecture cr osses multiple systems and multiple functional 
groups within the enterprise. 
 Confusion often arises from the evolving natu re of the term “enterprise”. An extended 
enterprise frequently includes partners, suppliers, an d customers. If the goal is to integrate an 
extended enterprise, then the enterprise compris es the partners, suppliers, and customers, as 
well as internal business units. 
For example, an organization with an online st ore that uses an external fulfillment house for 
dispatching orders would extend its definition of the enterprise in that system to include the fulfillment house. 
2.4 What is Architecture in  the Context of TOGAF? 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 1, Learning Outcom e 8: You should be able to explain what 
architecture is in the context of TOGAF.) 
ISO/IEC 42010:20077 defines “architecture” as: 
“The fundamental organization of a system, embodied in its components, their relationships to 
each other and the environment, and the pr inciples governing its design and evolution.”

TOGAF® 9 Foundation Study Guide, 2nd Edition  13 TOGAF embraces but does not strictly adhere to ISO/IEC 42010:2007 terminology. In TOGAF, 
“architecture” has two meanings depending upon the context: 
1. A formal description of a system, or a detailed plan of the system at a component level to 
guide its implementation 
2. The structure of components, their inter-relationships, and the principles and guidelines 
governing their design and evolution over time 
 What is enterprise architecture? 
There are many definitions of enterprise ar chitecture. Most focus on structure and 
organization. Two definitions are given below: 
Enterprise architecture  is: 
1. The organizing logic for business processes and IT infrastructure reflecting the integration 
and standardization requirements of the firm’s operating model. 
[Source: MIT Center for Information Systems Research] 
2. A conceptual blueprint that defines the structure and operation of an organization. The 
intent of an enterprise architecture is to determine how an organization can most effectively achieve its current and future objectives. 
[Source: SearchCIO.com] 
2.5 Why do I Need Enterprise Architecture? 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 1, Learning Outcome 2:  You should be able to explain the purpose of 
an enterprise architecture.) 
The purpose of enterprise architecture is to op timize across the enterprise the often fragmented 
legacy of processes (both manual and automated) into an integrated environment that is 
responsive to change and supportive of the de livery of the business strategy. Effective 
management and exploitation of information through IT is a key factor to business success, and 
an indispensable means to achieving competitive advantage. An enterprise architecture addresses 
this need, by providing a strategic context for th e evolution of the IT sy stem in response to the 
constantly changing needs of the business environment. 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 1, Learning Outcome 3: You should be able to list the business 
benefits of having an enterprise architecture.) 
The advantages that result from a good enterpri se architecture can bring important business 
benefits, including: 
• A more efficient business operation: 
— Lower business operation costs 
— More agile organization 
— Business capabilities shared across the organization 
— Lower change management costs

14  Study Guide (2011) — More flexible workforce 
— Improved business productivity 
• A more efficient IT operation: 
— Lower software development, support, and maintenance costs 
— Increased portability of applications 
— Improved interoperability and easier system and network management 
— Improved ability to address critical ente rprise-wide issues, such as security 
— Easier upgrade and exchange of system components 
• Better return on existing investment, re duced risk for future investment: 
— Reduced complexity in the business and IT 
— Maximum return on investment in existing business and IT infrastructure 
— The flexibility to make, buy, or out-source business and IT solutions 
— Reduced risk overall in new investme nts and their costs of ownership 
• Faster, simpler, and cheaper procurement: 
— Simpler buying decisions, because the inform ation governing procurement is readily 
available in a coherent plan 
— Faster procurement process, maximizing procurement speed and flexibility without 
sacrificing architectural coherence 
— The ability to procure heteroge neous, multi-vendor open systems 
— The ability to secure more economic capabilities 
 Ultimately, the benefits of enterprise archit ecture derive from the better planning, earlier 
visibility, and more informed designs  that result when it is introduced.

2.6 What is an Architecture Framework? 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 1, Learning Outcome 4: You should be able to define what an 
architecture framework is.) 
An architecture framework is a foundational structure,  or set of structures, that can be used for 
developing a broad range of different architect ures. It should describe a method for designing a 
target state of the enterprise in terms of a set of building blocks, and for showing how the 
building blocks fit together. It should contain a set of tools and provide a common vocabulary. It 
should also include a list of recommended standards and compliant products that can be used to 
implement the building blocks.

TOGAF® 9 Foundation Study Guide, 2nd Edition  15 2.7 Why do I Need a Framework for Enterprise Architecture? 
Using an architecture framework will speed up and simplify architecture development, ensure 
more complete coverage of the designed solution, and make certain that the architecture selected allows for future growth in res ponse to the needs of the business. 
 Regulatory Drivers for Adoption  of Enterprise Architecture 
There are a number of laws and regulations that  have been drivers for the adoption and use of 
enterprise architecture in business: 
• The Clinger-Cohen Act 
(US Information Technology Ma nagement Reform Act 1996) 
The US Information Technology Manageme nt Reform Act (Clinger-Cohen Act) is 
designed to improve the way the US Federa l Government acquires and manages IT. It 
mandates the use of a formal enterprise architecture process for all US federal 
agencies. 
• The Sarbanes-Oxley Act 
(US Public Company Accounting Reform  and Investor Protection Act 2002) 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act was passed in r esponse to a number of major corporate and 
accounting scandals involving prominent companies in the US (for example, Enron and Worldcom). Under the Act, companies must provide attestation of internal control 
assessment, including documentation of control procedures related to IT. 
• EU Directives on the Award of Public Contracts 
Similarly within the European Union, there are EU Directives that require vendors 
involved in Public Contracts to show that they are using formal enterprise architecture 
processes within their bu sinesses when supplying products and services. 
2.8 Why is TOGAF Suitable as a Framework for Enterprise 
Architecture? 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 1, Learning Outcome 5: You should be able explain why TOGAF is 
suitable as a framework for enterprise architecture.) 
TOGAF has been developed through the collabor ative efforts of more than 300 Architecture 
Forum member companies from some of the wo rld's leading companies and organizations. 
Using TOGAF results in enterprise architecture that is consistent, reflects the needs of 
stakeholders, employs best practice, and gives due consideration both to current requirements 
and to the perceived future needs of the business. 
Developing and sustaining an enterprise architecture is a technically complex process which 
involves many stakeholders and decision pr ocesses in the organization. TOGAF plays an 
important role in standardizing and risk re duction of the architecture development process. 
TOGAF provides a best practice framework for a dding value, and enables the organization to 
build workable and economic solutions wh ich address their business issues and needs.

16  Study Guide (2011) 2.9 What are the Different Archi tecture Domains that TOGAF deals 
with? 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 1, Learning Outcome 9:  You should be able to list the different types 
of architecture that TOGAF deals with.) 
TOGAF 9 covers the development of four architecture domains. These are commonly accepted 
as subsets of an overall enterprise architecture, a ll of which TOGAF is designed to support. They 
are as follows: 
Table 4: Architecture Doma ins Supported by TOGAF 
Architecture Type Description 
Business Architecture The business strategy, governance, organization, and key business 
processes. 
Data Architecture The structure of an organi zation's logical and physical data assets and 
data management resources. 
Application Architecture A blueprint for the individual application systems to be deployed, their 
interactions, and their relationships to the core business processes of the 
organization. 
Technology Architecture The software and hardware  capabilities that are required to support the 
deployment of business, data, and application services. This includes IT 
infrastructure, middleware, networks, communications, processing, and 
standards. 
2.10 What does TOGAF Contain? 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 1, Learning Outcome 6:  You should be able to describe the structure 
of TOGAF, and briefly explain the contents of each part.) 
TOGAF reflects the structure and content of an  architecture capability within an enterprise, as 
shown in Figure 4. 
 Definition of “Capability” 
An ability that an organization, person, or sy stem possesses. Capabilities are typically expressed 
in general and high-level terms and typically require a combination of organization, people, 
processes, and technology to achieve. For example,  marketing, customer contact, or outbound 
telemarketing. 
[Source: TOGAF 9 Part I: Introduction, Chapter 3 (Definitions)] 
An enterprise architecture capability  (or architecture capability) in the context of TOGAF, is 
the ability for an organization to effectively unde rtake the activities of an  enterprise architecture 
practice.

TOGAF® 9 Foundation Study Guide, 2nd Edition  17 
 
Figure 4: TOGAF Co ntent Overview 
Central to TOGAF is the Architecture Development Method (documented in TOGAF 9 Part II: 
ADM). The architecture capability (documented in TOGAF 9 Part VII: Architecture Capability 
Framework) operates the method. The method is supported by a number of guidelines and 
techniques (documented in TOGAF 9 Part III: ADM  Guidelines and Techniques). This produces 
content to be stored in the repository (docum ented in TOGAF 9 Part IV: Architecture Content 
Framework), which is classified according to the Enterprise Continuum (documented in TOGAF 
9 Part V: Enterprise Continuum and Tools). Th e repository is initially populated with the 
TOGAF Reference Models (documented in TOGAF 9 Part VI: TOGAF Reference Models). 
These are described in the following sections. 
2.10.1 The Architecture De velopment Method (ADM) 
The ADM describes a process for deriving an orga nization-specific enterprise architecture that 
addresses business requirements. 
Personal PDF Edition 
© 2011 The Open Group, All Rights Reserved
Personal PDF Edition. Not for redistribution
 
18  Study Guide (2011) The ADM is the major component of TOGAF and provides guidance for architects on a number 
of levels: 
• It provides a number of architecture development phases  (Business Architecture, 
Information Systems Architectures, Technology Architecture) in a cycle, as an overall 
process template for architecture development activity. 
• It provides a narrative of each architecture phase , describing the phase in terms of 
objectives, approach, inputs, steps, and outputs. The inputs and outputs sections provide a definition of the architecture content structure and deliverables (a detailed description of the 
phase inputs and phase outputs is given in the Architecture Content Framework). 
• It provides cross-phase summaries that cover requirements management. 
See also Chapter 5 and Chapter 7. 
2.10.2 ADM Guidelines and Techniques 
ADM Guidelines and Techniques  provides a number of guidelines and techniques to support 
the application of the ADM. The guidelines address adapting the ADM to deal with a number of 
usage scenarios, including different process styl es (e.g., the use of iteration) and also specific 
specialty architectures (such as security). The t echniques support specific tasks within the ADM 
(such as defining principles, business scenario s, gap analysis, migration planning, risk 
management, etc.). 
See also Chapter 8. 
2.10.3 Architecture Content Framework 
The Architecture Content Framework  provides a detailed model of architectural work 
products, including deliverables, artifacts with in deliverables, and the Architecture Building 
Blocks (ABBs) that deliverables represent. 
The details of the Architecture Content Framew ork are out of scope for TOGAF 9 Foundation, 
and are covered instead in the Level 2 syllabus. 
2.10.4 The Enterprise Continuum 
The Enterprise Continuum  provides a model for structuring a virtual repository and provides 
methods for classifying architecture and solution artifacts, showing how the different types of 
artifacts evolve, and how they can be leveraged and re-used. This is based on architectures and 
solutions (models, patterns, architecture descriptions , etc.) that exist within the enterprise and in 
the industry at large, and whic h the enterprise has collected for use in the development of its 
architectures. 
See also Section 3.4 and Chapter 6. 
2.10.5 TOGAF Reference Models 
TOGAF provides two reference models for possible inclusion in an enterprise's own Enterprise 
Continuum.

based on the TOGAF Foundation Architecture, and is specifically 
aimed at helping the design of archit ectures that enable  and support the 
vision of Boundaryless Information Flow. 
See also Chapter 13. 
2.10.6 The Architecture Capability Framework 
The Architecture Capability Framework  is a set of resources, guidelines, templates, 
background information, etc. provided to help the architect establish an architecture practice 
within an organization. 
See also Section 3.6, Section 3.7, and Chapter 9. 
2.11 Summary 
This chapter has introduced the basic concepts of enterprise ar chitecture and TOGAF. This has 
included answering questions, such as: 
• “What is an enterprise?” 
— A collection of organizations that share a common set of goals, such as a government 
agency, part of a corporation, or a corporation in its entirety. 
— Large corporations may comprise multiple enterprises. 
— An “extended enterprise” can include pa rtners, suppliers, and customers. 
• “What is an architecture?” 
— An architecture is defined as “the fundamental organization of something, embodied in 
its components, their relationships to ea ch other and the environment, and the 
principles governing its design and evolution.” 
TOGAF is an architecture framework. It enabl es you to design, evaluate, and build the right 
architecture for your organization. An architectur e framework is a toolkit that can be used for 
developing a broad range of different architectures. 
• It should describe a method to design an information system in terms of a set of building 
blocks, and show how the bu ilding blocks fit together. 
• It should contain a set of tools and provide a common vocabulary.

20  Study Guide (2011) • It should also include a list of recommended st andards and compliant products that can be 
used to implement the building blocks. 
The value of a framework is that it provides a pr actical starting point for an architecture project. 
The components of TOGAF 9 are as follows: 
• Architecture Development Method (ADM) 
• ADM Guidelines and Techniques 
• The Architecture Content Framework 
• The Enterprise Continuum and Tools 
• TOGAF Reference Models

22  Study Guide (2011) Chapter 3 Core Concepts 
3.1 Key Learning Points 
This chapter will help you understand and be ab le to explain the core concepts of TOGAF.  
Key Points Explained 
This chapter will help you to answer the following questions: 
• What are the ADM phase names and the purpose of each phase? 
• What are deliverables, artifacts, and building blocks? 
• What is the Enterprise Continuum? 
• What is the Architecture Repository? 
• How to establish and operate an enterprise architecture capability? 
• How to use TOGAF with other frameworks? 
3.2 What are the Phases of the ADM? 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 2, Learning Outcom e 1: You should be able to explain the core 
concept of the ADM and the purpose of each phase at a high level.)  
The Architecture Development Method (ADM) form s the core of TOGAF and is a method for 
deriving organization-specific enterprise architecture.  It is the result of contributions from many 
architecture practitioners. 
The ADM provides a tested and repeatable pr ocess for developing architectures. The ADM 
includes establishing an architecture framework, de veloping architecture content, transitioning, 
and governing the realization of architectures. A ll of these activities are carried out within an 
iterative cycle of continuous architecture definiti on and realization that allows organizations to 
transform their enterprises in a controlle d manner in response to business goals and 
opportunities. 
The ADM is described as a number of phases within  a process of change illustrated by an ADM 
cycle graphic (see following). Phases within the ADM are as follows:

TOGAF® 9 Foundation Study Guide, 2nd Edition  23 The Preliminary Phase  describes the preparation 
and initiation activities required to create an Architecture Capability, including the customization 
of TOGAF, and the definition of Architecture 
Principles. 
Phase A: Architecture Vision  describes the initial 
phase of an Architecture Development Cycle. It 
includes information about defining the scope, 
identifying the stakeholders, creating the Architecture Vision, and obtaining approvals. 
Phase B: Business Architecture  describes the 
development of a Business Architecture to support an 
agreed Architecture Vision. 
Phase C: Information Systems Architectures  
describes the development of Information Systems 
Architectures for an architecture project, including the development of Data and Application Architectures. 
Phase D: Technology Architecture  describes the development of the Technology Architecture 
for an architecture project. 
Phase E: Opportunities and Solutions  describes the process of identifying major 
implementation projects and grouping them in to work packages that  deliver the Target 
Architecture defined in the previous phases. 
Phase F: Migration Planning  describes the development of a detailed Implementation and 
Migration Plan that addresses how to move fro m the Baseline to the Target Architecture. 
Phase G: Implementation Governance  provides an architectural oversight of the 
implementation. 
Phase H: Architecture Change Management  establishes procedures for managing change to 
the new architecture. 
Requirements Management  examines the process of managing architecture requirements 
throughout the ADM. 
3.3 Deliverables, Artifacts, and Building Blocks 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 2, Learning Outcom e 2: You should be able to explain the core 
concepts of deliverables, artifacts, and building bl ocks in the context of the Architecture Content 
Framework.)  
During application of the ADM process, a number of outputs are produced; for example, process 
flows, architectural requirements, project plans, project compliance assessments, etc. In order to 
collate and present these major work products in  a consistent and structured manner, TOGAF

Personal PDF Edition. Not for redistribution
 
24  Study Guide (2011) defines a structural model – the TOGAF Archit ecture Content Framework – in which to place 
them. 
The Architecture Content Framework uses the follo wing three categories to describe the type of 
architectural work product within the context of use: 
• A deliverable  is a work product that is contractually specified and in turn formally 
reviewed, agreed, and signed off by the stak eholders. Deliverables represent the output of 
projects and those deliverables that are in documentation form will typically be archived at completion of a project, or transitioned into an Architecture Repository as a reference model, standard, or snapshot of the Architecture Landscape at a point in time. 
• An artifact  is an architectural work product that  describes an aspect of the architecture. 
Artifacts are generally classified as catalogs (lists of things), matrices (showing relationships between things), and diagrams  (pictures of things). Examples include a 
requirements catalog, business interaction matrix, and a use-case diagram.. An architectural 
deliverable may contain many artifacts and artifacts will form the content of the Architecture Repository. 
• A building block  represents a (potentially re-usable) component of business, IT, or 
architectural capability that can be combined  with other building blocks to deliver 
architectures and solutions. 
Building blocks can be defined at various levels of detail and can relate to both architectures and 
solutions, with Architecture Building Blocks (ABBs ) typically describing th e required capability 
in order to shape the Solution Building Blocks (SBBs) which would represent the components to 
be used to implement the required capability. 
The relationships between deliverables, artifacts,  and building blocks are shown in Figure 5.

TOGAF® 9 Foundation Study Guide, 2nd Edition  25 3.4 The Enterprise Continuum 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 2, Learning Outcom e 3: You should be able to explain the core 
concept of the Enterprise Continuum.)  
TOGAF includes the concept of the Enterprise Continuum, shown in Figure 6, which sets the 
broader context for an architect and explains  how generic solutions can be leveraged and 
specialized in order to support the requirements of an individual organization. The Enterprise 
Continuum is a view of the Architecture Re pository that provides methods for classifying 
architecture and solution artifacts as they evol ve from generic Foundation Architectures to 
Organization-Specific Architectures. The Enterprise Continuum comprises two complementary concepts: the Architecture Continuu m and the Solutions Continuum. 
 
Figure 6: The Enterprise Continuum 
 The Enterprise Continuum and the Architecture Repository 
The Enterprise Continuum provides a view of the Architecture Repository that shows the 
evolution of these related architectures from generi c to specific, from abstract to concrete, and 
from logical to physical.

26  Study Guide (2011) 3.5 The Architecture Repository 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 2, Learning Outcom e 4: You should be able to explain the core 
concept of the Architecture Repository.) 
Supporting the Enterprise Continuum is the concep t of an Architecture Repository which can be 
used to store different classes of architectural output  at different levels of abstraction, created by 
the ADM. In this way, TOGAF facilitates unders tanding and co-operation between stakeholders 
and practitioners at different levels. 
The structure of the TOGAF Architecture Repository is shown in Figure 7. 
 
Figure 7: TOGAF Architecture Repository Structure 
The major components within an Architecture Repository are as follows: 
• The Architecture Metamodel  describes the organizationally tailored application of an 
architecture framework, including a metamodel for architecture content. 
• The Architecture Capability  defines the parameters, structures, and processes that support 
governance of the Architecture Repository. 
• The Architecture Landscape  shows an architectural view of the building blocks that are in 
use within the organization today (e.g., a list of the live applications). The landscape is 
likely to exist at multiple levels of abstr action to suit different architecture objectives.

TOGAF® 9 Foundation Study Guide, 2nd Edition  27 • The Standards Information Base (SIB)8 captures the standards with which new 
architectures must comply, which may include industry standards, selected products and 
services from suppliers, or shared services al ready deployed within the organization. 
• The Reference Library  provides guidelines, templates, patterns, and other forms of 
reference material that can be leveraged in order to accelerate the creation of new 
architectures for the enterprise. 
• The Governance Log  provides a record of governance  activity across the enterprise. 
3.6 Establishing and Maintaining an Enterprise Architecture 
Capability 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 2, Learning Outcom e 5: You should be able to explain the core 
concept of establishing and maintain ing an Enterprise Architecture Capability.)  
TOGAF 9 provides an Architecture Capability Framew ork that is a set of reference materials and 
guidelines for establishing an architecture function or capability within an organization. A summary of the contents is shown in Table 6.

3.7 Establishing an Operational Architecture Capability 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 2, Learning Outcom e 6: You should be able to explain the core 
concept of establishing the Architect ure Capability as an operational entity.) 
An enterprise architecture practice must be run like any other operational unit within a business; 
i.e., it should be treated like a business. To th is end, and over and a bove the core processes 
defined within the ADM, an enterprise archit ecture practice should establish capabilities in the 
following areas: 
• Financial Management 
• Performance Management 
• Service Management 
• Risk Management 
• Resource Management 
• Communications and Stakeholder Management 
• Quality Management

TOGAF® 9 Foundation Study Guide, 2nd Edition  29 • Supplier Management 
• Configuration Management 
• Environment Management 
Central to the notion of operating an ongoing architecture is the execution of well-defined and 
effective governance – Architecture Governance – wh ereby all architecturally significant activity 
is controlled and aligned within a single framework. 
The benefits of Architecture Governance include: 
• Increased transparency of accountability, and informed delegation of authority 
• Controlled risk management 
• Protection of the existing asset base through maximizing re-use of existing architectural 
components 
• Proactive control, monitoring, and management mechanisms 
• Process, concept, and component re-use across all organizational business units 
• Value creation through monitoring, measuring, evaluation, and feedback 
• Increased visibility supporting internal processes and external  parties' requirements; in 
particular, increased visibility of decision-maki ng at lower levels ensures oversight at an 
appropriate level within the enterprise of d ecisions that may have far-reaching strategic 
consequences for the organization 
• Greater shareholder value; in particular, en terprise architecture increasingly represents the 
core intellectual property of the enterpri se – studies have demonstrated a correlation 
between increased shareholder va lue and well-governed enterprises 
• Integrates with existing processes and met hodologies and complements functionality by 
adding control capabilities 
3.8 Using TOGAF with Other Frameworks 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 2, Learning Outcom e 7: You should be able to explain the core 
concept of the use of TOGAF with other frameworks.) 
Two of the key elements of any enterprise ar chitecture framework are a definition of the 
deliverables that the architecting activity should produce, together with a description of the 
method for production. 
Many enterprise architecture frameworks focus on  the first of these – the specific set of 
deliverables – and are relatively silent about the methods to be used to generate them. 
Because TOGAF is a generic framework and in tended to be used in a wide variety of 
environments, it provides a flexible and extensib le content framework that underpins a set of 
generic architecture deliverables. As a result, T OGAF may be used either in its own right, with 
Personal PDF Edition

Personal PDF Edition. Not for redistribution
 
30  Study Guide (2011) the generic deliverables that it describes; or else  these deliverables may be replaced or extended 
by a more specific set, defined in any other fra mework that the architect considers relevant. 
In all cases, it is expected that the architect will adapt and build on the TOGAF framework in 
order to define a tailored method that is integrat ed into the processes and organization structures 
of the enterprise. This architecture tailori ng may include adopting elements from other 
architecture frameworks, or integrating TOGAF me thods with other standard frameworks, such 
as ITIL, CMMI, COBIT, PRINCE2, PMBOK, and MSP. 
As a generic framework and method for enterpri se architecture, TOGAF also complements other 
frameworks that are aimed at sp ecific vertical business domains, specific horizontal technology 
areas (such as security or manageability), or specific application areas (such as e-Commerce). 
 Key Fact 
Why is TOGAF becoming so popular in the industry? One key reason is that architects can use th e TOGAF ADM in conjunction with any of the 
popular frameworks. 
The TOGAF ADM is framework-agnostic, and helps IT architects fill in the framework they 
might already have in use.

3.9 Summary 
This chapter has introduced th e core concepts of TOGAF. This has included the following: 
• The ADM and the purpose of each phase 
• The concepts of deliverables, artifacts, and building blocks, and how they relate to the 
outputs of the ADM 
• The Enterprise Continuum as a concept, a nd how it is used to classify artifacts 
• The Architecture Repository and how it is used to store different classes of architectural 
output 
• How to establish and maintain an enterp rise architecture capability, and the guidelines 
available within TOGAF 
• How to operate an architecture capability, including a list of recommended capabilities 
beyond the ADM 
• The use of TOGAF with other frameworks, and how TOGAF may be used on its own or in 
conjunction with another framework

Represents a (potentially re-usable) component of  business, IT, or architectural capability that 
can be combined with other building blocks to deliver architectures and solutions. 
Building blocks can be defined at various le vels of detail, depending on what stage of 
architecture development has been reached. For in stance, at an early stage, a building block can 
simply consist of a name or an outline description. Later on, a building block may be 
decomposed into multiple supporting building blocks and may be accompanied by a full 
specification. Building blocks can rela te to “architectures” or “solutions”.

46  Study Guide (2011) 5.2 The Architecture Development Cycle 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 4, Learning Outcome 1:  You should be able to briefly describe the 
ADM cycle, its phases and the objective of each phase.)  
The ADM consists of a number of phases that cycle through a range of architecture domains that 
enable the architect to ensure that a complex set of requirements is adequately addressed. The 
basic structure of the ADM is shown in Figure 9. 
 
Figure 9: The Architecture Development Method Cycle 
The ADM is applied iteratively throughout the en tire process, between phases, and within them. 
Throughout the ADM cycle, there should be frequent  validation of results against the original 
requirements, both those for the whole ADM cycle, and those for the particular phase of the 
process. Such validation should reconsider scope, detail, schedules, and milestones. Each phase 
should consider assets produced from previous itera tions of the process and external assets from 
the marketplace, such as other frameworks or models.

TOGAF® 9 Foundation Study Guide, 2nd Edition  47 The ADM supports the concept of iteration at three levels: 
• Cycling around the ADM : The ADM is presented in a circular manner indicating that the 
completion of one phase of architecture work directly feeds into subsequent phases of 
architecture work. 
• Iterating between phases : TOGAF describes the concept of iterating across phases (e.g., 
returning to Business Architecture on completion of Technology Architecture). 
• Cycling around a single phase : TOGAF supports repeated execution of the activities 
within a single ADM phase as a technique for elaborating architectural content. 
A summary of the objectives is shown in Table 7. 
Table 7: Architecture Developmen t Method Activities by Phase 
ADM Phase Objectives 
Preliminary Phase Prepare th e organization for successful TOGAF architecture projects. 
Undertake the preparation and initiation activities required to create an 
Architecture Capability, including the customization of TOGAF, 
selection of tools, and the definition of Architecture Principles. 
Requirements Management Every stage of a TOGAF project is based on and validates business 
requirements. 
Requirements are identified, stored, and fed into and out of the relevant 
ADM phases, which dispose of, addr ess, and prioritize requirements. 
Phase A: 
Architecture Vision Set the scope, constraints, and expectations for a TOGAF project. 
Create the Architecture Vision. Id entify stakeholders. Validate the 
business context and create the St atement of Architecture Work. 
Obtain approvals. 
Phase B: Business Architecture 
Phase C: 
Information Systems 
Architectures 
(Application & Data) 
Phase D: 
Technology Architecture Develop architectures in four domains: 
1. Business 
2. Information Systems – Application 
3. Information Systems – Data 
4. Technology 
In each case, develop the Baseline an d Target Architecture and analyze 
gaps. 
Phase E: 
Opportunities & Solutions Perform initial implementation planning and the identification of 
delivery vehicles for the building blocks identified in the previous 
phases. Determine whether an incremental approach is required, and if so identify Transition Architectures. 
Phase F: 
Migration Planning Develop detailed Implementation and Migration Plan that addresses 
how to move from the Baseline to the Target Architecture. 
Phase G: Implementation Governance Provide architectural oversight fo r the implementation. Prepare and 
issue Architecture Contracts. Ensure  that the implementation project 
conforms to the architecture.

48  Study Guide (2011) ADM Phase Objectives 
Phase H: 
Architecture Change 
Management Provide continual monitoring and a change management process to 
ensure that the architecture responds to the needs of the enterprise and 
maximizes the value of the ar chitecture to the business. 
 
 Scoping an Enterprise Architecture Activity 
The ADM defines a recommended sequence for th e various phases and steps involved in 
developing an organization-wide enterprise archite cture, but does not determine the scope for an 
enterprise architecture activity; this must be determined by the organization itself. 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 4, Learning Outcome 2: You should be able to describe a typical set of 
steps.) 
The phases of the ADM cycle are further divided in to steps; for example, the steps within the 
Business Architecture phase are as follows: 
 
note
 The steps shown are uniform for Phases B, C, and D. 
TOGAF 9 Foundation does not go into the detail of  the contents of the steps within the ADM 
phases. That is a topic for the Level 2, TOGAF 9 Certified. 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 4, Learning Outcome 3: You should be able to describe the versioning 
convention for deliverables used in Phases A to D.)  
Throughout the process of applying the ADM, outputs are generated. An output in an early 
phase may be modified in a later phase. The vers ioning of output is ma naged through version 
numbers.

 ADM Output Versioning 
The numbering scheme provided in the TOGAF ADM for its outputs is intended as an example. 
It should be adapted by the architect to meet th e requirements of the organization and to work 
with the architecture tools and repositories employed by the organization. 
5.3 What is the Relationship of th e ADM to Other Parts of TOGAF? 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 4, Learning Outcom e 4: You should be able to describe the 
relationship between the ADM and other parts  of TOGAF – the Enterprise Continuum, 
Architecture Repository, Foundation Architectu re, and Supporting Guidelines and Techniques.)  
This section explains the relationship betw een the ADM and other parts of TOGAF. 
5.3.1 Relationship to the Enterprise Continuum and Architecture Repository 
The Enterprise Continuum is an approach for cat egorizing architectural source material – both 
the contents of the organization's own Architectur e Repository, and the set of relevant, available 
reference models in the industry. The practical implementation of the Enterprise Continuum will 
typically take the form of an Architecture Re pository that includes reference architectures, 
models, and patterns that have been accepted for use within the enterprise, and actual 
architectural work done previously within the enterprise. 
At relevant places throughout the ADM, there are reminders to consider which architecture 
assets from the Architecture Repository the architect  should use, if any. In some cases – for 
example, in the development of a Technol ogy Architecture – this may be the TOGAF

50  Study Guide (2011) Foundation Architecture. Similarly, in the development of a Business Architecture, it may be a 
reference model for e-Commerce taken from the industry at large. 
While using the ADM, the architect is developing  a snapshot of the enterprise's decisions and 
their implications at particular points in time. Each iteration of the ADM will populate an 
organization-specific landscape with all the arch itecture assets identified and leveraged through 
the process, including the final organi zation-specific architecture delivered. 
Architecture development is a continuous, cyclical process, and in executing the ADM 
repeatedly over time, the architect gradually adds  more and more content to the organization's 
Architecture Repository. Although the primary focu s of the ADM is on the development of the 
enterprise-specific architecture, in this wider c ontext the ADM can also be viewed as the process 
of populating the enterprise's own Architectur e Repository with relevant re-usable building 
blocks taken from the “left”, more gene ric side of the Enterprise Continuum. 
In fact, the first execution of the ADM will ofte n be the hardest, since the architecture assets 
available for re-use will be relatively scarce. Even at this stage of development, however, there 
will be architecture assets available from exte rnal sources such as TOGAF, as well as the IT 
industry at large, that could be le veraged in support of the effort. 
Subsequent executions will be easier, as more and more architecture assets become identified, 
are used to populate the organization's Architectur e Repository, and are thus available for future 
re-use. 
5.3.2 The ADM and the Foundation Architecture 
The ADM is also useful when populating the Fou ndation Architecture of an enterprise. Business 
requirements of an enterprise may be used to identify the necessary defin itions and selections in 
the Foundation Architecture. This could be a set of re-usable common models, policy and 
governance definitions, or even as specific as overriding technology selections (e.g., if mandated 
by law). Population of the Foundation Architecture follows similar principles as for an enterprise 
architecture, with the difference that requirement s for a whole enterprise are restricted to the 
overall concerns and thus less complete than for a specific enterprise. 
5.3.3 The ADM and Supporting Guidelines and Techniques 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 4, Learning Outcome 5:  You should be able to explain the purpose of 
the supporting guidelines and techniques, and the difference between guidelines and 
techniques.)  
TOGAF 9 Part III: ADM Guidelines and Techni ques is a set of resources – guidelines, 
templates, checklists, and other detailed material s – that directly support application of the 
TOGAF ADM. 
The individual guidelines and techniques are describe d in a separate part of TOGAF so that they 
can be referenced from the relevant points in the ADM as necessary, rather than having the 
detailed text clutter the description of the ADM itself.

TOGAF® 9 Foundation Study Guide, 2nd Edition  51 Guidelines versus Technique 
The guidelines provided with TOGAF describe ho w the ADM process can be adapted to deal 
with a number of different usage scenarios, incl uding different process styles (e.g., the use of 
iteration) and also specific specia lty architectures (such as security). 
The techniques described within TOGAF 9 Part III support specific tasks within the ADM (e.g., 
the gap analysis technique, principles, etc.). 
5.4 Key Points of the ADM Cycle 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 4, Learning Outcome 6: You should be able to briefly explain the key 
points of the ADM cycle.)  
The TOGAF ADM is iterative. New decisions have to be taken at each iteration: 
1. Enterprise coverage 
2. Level of detail 
3. Time period 
4. Architecture asset re-use: 
— Previous ADM iterations 
— Other frameworks, system models, industry models, … 
Decisions taken should be based on competen ce and/or resource availability, and the value 
accruing to the enterprise. 
The ADM does not recommend the scope of activit y; this has to be determined by the 
organization itself. 
The choice of scope is critical to the success of the architecting effort. The main guideline is to 
focus on what creates value to the enterprise, and to select horizontal and vertical scope, and 
project schedules, accordingly. This exercise will be  repeated, and future iterations will build on 
what is being created in the current effort, adding greater width and depth. 
Where necessary, use of the ADM should be tailore d to meet the needs of the organization. This 
means that some phases may be omitted, modi fied, or even additional procedures added.  
5.5 How to Adapt the ADM to your Enterprise 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 4, Learning Outcome 7:  You should be able to list the main reasons 
why you would need to adapt the ADM.)  
The ADM is a generic method for architecture devel opment, which is designed to deal with most 
system and organizational requirements. It easily  copes with variable geographies, vertical 
sectors, and industry types. However, it will often be necessary to modify or extend the ADM to suit specific needs. One of the tasks before applying the ADM is to review the process and its 
Personal PDF Edition

Personal PDF Edition. Not for redistribution
 
52  Study Guide (2011) outputs for applicability, and then tailor them as appropriate to the circumstances of the 
individual enterprise. This activity may well produce an “enterprise-specific” ADM. 
There are a number of reasons for wanting to tailor the ADM to the circumstances of an 
individual enterprise. Some of the reasons are outlined as follows: 
1. An important consideration is that the order of the phases in the ADM is to some extent 
dependent on the maturity of the architectur e discipline within the enterprise concerned. 
For example, if the business case for doing architecture is not well recognized, then 
creating an Architecture Vision is essential; a nd a detailed Business Architecture needs to 
come next to define the business case for th e remaining architecture work, and secure the 
active participation of key stakeholders in that work. 
2. The order of phases may also be defined by the business and architecture principles of an 
enterprise. For example, the business principles may dictate that the enterprise be prepared 
to adjust its business processes to meet the need s of a packaged solution, so that it can be 
implemented quickly to enable fast respon se to market changes. In such a case, the 
Business Architecture (or at least the comple tion of it) may well follow completion of the 
Information Systems Architecture. 
3. An enterprise may wish to use or tailor th e ADM in conjunction with another enterprise 
architecture framework that has a defined set of deliverables specific to a particular 
vertical sector: Government, Defense, e-Business, Telecommunications, etc. 
4. The ADM is one of many corporate processes that make up the corporate governance 
model for an enterprise. The ADM is compleme ntary to, and supportive of, other standard 
program management processes. The enterp rise will tailor the ADM to reflect the 
relationships with, and dependencies on, the other management processes. 
5. The ADM is being mandated for use by a prim e or lead contractor in an outsourcing 
situation, and needs to be tailored to achieve a suitable compromise between the 
contractor's existing practices and the contracting enterprise's requirements. 
6. The enterprise is a small-to-medium enterprise,  and wishes to use a “cut-down” version of 
the ADM that is more attuned to the reduced level of resources and system complexity 
typical of such an environment. 
7. The enterprise is very large and complex,  comprising many separate but interlinked 
“enterprises” within an overall collaborativ e business framework, and the architecture 
method needs to be adapted to recognize this . Such enterprises usually cannot be treated 
successfully as a single entity and a mo re federated approach is required. 
The ADM process can also be ad apted to deal with a number of different use scenarios, 
including different process styles (e.g., the u se of iteration) and also specific specialist 
architectures (such as security). These are discussed in Chapter 8.

TOGAF® 9 Foundation Study Guide, 2nd Edition  53 5.6 The Need for Architecture Governance 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 4, Learning Outcome 8: Y ou should be able to explain the need for the 
ADM process to be governed.)  
The ADM, whether adapted by the organization or used as documented in TOGAF, is a key 
process to be managed and governed. The Archite cture Board should be satisfied that the 
method is being applied correctly across all ph ases of an architecture development iteration. 
Compliance with the ADM is fundamental to the g overnance of the architect ure, to ensure that 
all considerations are made and all required deliverables are produced. 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 4, Learning Outcome 9:  You should be able to describe the major 
information areas managed by a governance repository.)  
The management of all architectural artifact s, governance, and related processes should be 
supported by a controlled environment. Typical ly this would be based on one or more 
repositories supporting versioned object  and process control and status. 
The major information areas managed by a gove rnance repository should contain the following 
types of information: 
• Reference Data  (collateral from the organization's own repositories/Enterprise Continuum, 
including external data; e.g., COBIT, ITIL ): Used for guidance and instruction during 
project implementation. This includes the de tails of information outlined above. The 
reference data includes a description of  the governance procedures themselves. 
• Process Status : A record of all information regarding the state of any governance 
processes; examples of this include outstandi ng compliance requests, dispensation requests, 
and compliance assessment investigations. 
• Audit Information : A record of all completed governance process actions. This is used to 
support: 
— Key decisions and responsible personnel for any architecture project that has been 
sanctioned by the governance process 
— A reference for future architectural a nd supporting process developments, guidance, 
and precedence 
5.7 Scoping the Architecture Acti vity for your Organization 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 4, Learning Outcome 10:  You should be able to briefly explain the 
reasons for scoping an architecture activity.)  
There are many reasons to constrain (or restrict) the scope of the architectural activity to be 
undertaken, most of which relate to limits in: 
• The organizational authority of the team producing the architecture 
• The objectives and stakeholder concerns to  be addressed within the architecture 
Personal PDF Edition 
© 2011 The Open Group, All Rights Reserved
Personal PDF Edition. Not for redistribution
 
54  Study Guide (2011) • The availability of people, finance, and other resources 
The scope chosen for the architecture activity is normally directly dependent on available 
resources, and, in the final analysis, is usually a question of feasibility. 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 4, Learning Outcome 11: You should be able to list the possible 
dimensions for limiting the scope of an architecture activity.)  
Table 8 shows the four dimensions in wh ich the scope may be defined and limited. 
Table 8: Dimensions for Limiting th e Scope of the Architecture Activity 
Dimension Considerations 
Breadth  What is the full extent of the enterp rise, and what part of that extent 
should the architecting effort deal with? 
Many enterprises are very large, ef fectively comprising a federation of 
organizational units that could validly be considered enterprises in 
their own right. 
The modern enterprise increasingly extends beyond its traditional 
boundaries, to embrace a fuzzy comb ination of traditional business 
enterprise combined with suppliers, customers, and partners. 
Depth To what level of detail should the architecting effort go? How much 
architecture is “enough”? What is th e appropriate demarcation between 
the architecture effort and other, related activities (system design, 
system engineering, system development)? 
Time period What is the time period that needs to  be articulated for the Architecture 
Vision, and does it make sense (in terms of practicality and resources) 
for the same period to be covered in the detailed architecture description? If not, how many Tr ansition Architectures are to be 
defined, and what are their time periods? 
Architecture domains A complete enterprise architecture description should contain all four 
architecture domains (Business, Data , Application, Technology), but 
the realities of resource and time cons traints often mean there is not 
enough time, funding, or resources to build a top-down, all-inclusive 
architecture description encompassi ng all four architecture domains, 
even if the enterprise scope is chosen to be less than the full extent of 
the overall enterprise. 
Typically, the scope of an architecture is first expressed in terms of breadth, depth, and time. 
Once these dimensions are understood, a suitable combination of architecture domains can be 
selected that are appropriate to the problem being addressed. 
 
5.8 Integrating the Architecture Domains for your Organization 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 4, Learning Outcome 12:  You should be able to briefly explain the 
need for an integration framework that  sits above individual architectures.)

TOGAF® 9 Foundation Study Guide, 2nd Edition  55  
Architectures that are created to address a sub set of issues within an enterprise require a 
consistent frame of reference so that they can be considered as a group as well as point 
deliverables. The dimensions that are used to define the scope boundary of a single architecture 
(e.g., level of detail, architecture domain, etc.) are typically the same dimensions that must be 
addressed when considering the integration of  many architectures. Figure 10 illustrates how 
different types of architecture need to co-exist. 
 
Figure 10: Integration of Architecture Artifacts 
At the present time, the state-of-the-art is such that architecture integration can only be 
accomplished at the lower end of the integrati on spectrum. Key factors to consider are the 
granularity and level of detail in each artifact, a nd the maturity of standards for the interchange 
of architectural descriptions. 
5.9 Summary 
The TOGAF ADM is a comprehensive general method that defines a recommended sequence 
for the various phases and steps involved in developi ng an architecture. It is an iterative method. 
A number of inputs and outputs are recommended for each phase. It draws on other parts of TOGAF for assets and processes. The ADM can be  used with other deliverables from other 
frameworks. 
The ADM does not recommend a scope; this has to be  determined by the organization itself. The 
choice of scope is critical to the success of the ar chitecting effort. The main guideline is to focus 
on what creates value to the enterprise, and to select horizontal and vertical scope, and project schedules, accordingly. This exercise will be repeat ed, and future iterations will build on what is 
being created in the current effort, adding greater width and depth.

TOGAF® 9 Foundation Study Guide, 2nd Edition  59 6.2 Overview of the Enterprise Continuum 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 5, Learning Outcome 1: You should be able to briefly explain what the 
Enterprise Continuum is.)  
The Enterprise Continuum provides methods for cl assifying architecture and solution artifacts, 
both internal and external to the Architect ure Repository, as they evolve from generic 
Foundation Architectures to Organization-Specific Architectures. 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 5, Learning Outcome 2: You should be able to explain how the 
Enterprise Continuum is used in or ganizing and developing an architecture.)  
The Enterprise Continuum enables th e architect to articulate the broad perspective of what, why, 
and how the enterprise architecture has been desi gned with the factors and drivers considered. 
The Enterprise Continuum is an important aid to communication and understanding, both within 
individual enterprises, and between customer en terprises and vendor organizations. Without an 
understanding of “where in the continuum you are”, people discussing architecture can often talk 
at cross-purposes because they are referencing di fferent points in the continuum at the same 
time, without realizing it. 
 The Benefits of a Consistent Language 
Any architecture is context-specific; for exampl e, there are architectures that are specific to 
individual customers, industries, subsystems, products, and services. Architects, on both the buy-side and supply-side, must have at their disposal a consistent language to effectively 
communicate the differences between architectures. Such a language enables engineering 
efficiency and the effective use of Commercia l Off-The-Shelf (COTS) product functionality. 
The Enterprise Continuum provides that consistent language.  
6.3 The Enterprise Continuum and Architecture Re-Use 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 5, Learning Outcome 3: You should be able to explain how the 
Enterprise Continuum promotes re- use of architecture artifacts.)  
The Enterprise Continuum enables the organiza tion of re-usable architecture artifacts and 
solution assets to maximize the enterpri se architecture investment opportunities. 
The “virtual repository” that is the Enterprise C ontinuum consists of all the architecture assets; 
that is, models, patterns, architecture d escriptions, and other artifacts produced during 
application of the ADM. These can exist both within the enterprise and in the IT industry at large, and are considered the set of assets ava ilable for the development of architectures for the 
enterprise. 
The deliverables of previous architecture work, wh ich are available for re-use, are examples of 
internal architecture and solutions artifacts. Examples of external architecture and solution 
artifacts include the wide variety of industry re ference models and architecture patterns that 
exist, and are continually emerging, including those that are highly generic (such as TOGAF's 
own Technical Reference Model (TRM)); those specific to certain aspects of IT (such as a web 
services architecture); those specific to certain types of information processing (such as 
Personal PDF Edition 
© 2011 The Open Group, All Rights Reserved
Personal PDF Edition. Not for redistribution
 
60  Study Guide (2011) e-Commerce); and those specific to certain vertical industries, such as the models generated by 
vertical consortia like the TMF (in the Teleco mmunications sector), ARTS (Retail), Energistics 
(Petrotechnical), etc. 
The enterprise architecture determines which architecture and solution artifacts an organization 
includes in its Architecture Repository. Re-use is  a major consideration in this decision. 
6.4 The Constituent Parts of the Enterprise Continuum 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 5, Learning Outcome 4:  You should be able to describe the constituent 
parts of the Enterprise Continuum.)  
The Enterprise Continuum consists of three parts as described below, and illustrated in Figure 6. 
Each of the three parts is considered to be a distinct continuum. 
6.4.1 The Enterprise Continuum 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 5, Learning Outcome 5:  You should be able to explain the purpose of 
the Enterprise Continuum.)  
The Enterprise Continuum is the outermost contin uum and classifies assets related to the context 
of the overall enterprise architecture. 
The Enterprise Continuum classes of assets may infl uence architectures, but are not directly used 
during the ADM architecture development. The Enterprise Continuum classifies contextual 
assets used to develop architectures, such as  policies, standards, strategic initiatives, 
organizational structures, and enterprise-level capabilities. The Enterprise Continuum can also 
classify solutions (as opposed to descriptions or  specifications of solutions). Finally, the 
Enterprise Continuum contains two specializa tions, namely the Architecture and Solutions 
continuum. 
6.4.2 The Architecture Continuum 
The Architecture Continuum offers a consistent way to define and unders tand the generic rules, 
representations, and relationships in an arch itecture, including traceability and derivation 
relationships (e.g., to show that an Organizati on-Specific Architecture is based on an industry or 
generic standard). 
The Architecture Continuum represents a struct uring of Architecture Building Blocks (ABBs) 
which are re-usable architecture assets. ABBs evolve through their development lifecycle from 
abstract and generic entities to fully expressed Organization-Specific Architecture assets. The 
Architecture Continuum assets will be used to gui de and select the elements in the Solutions 
Continuum (see below). 
The Architecture Continuum shows the relati onships among foundational frameworks (such as 
TOGAF), common system architectures (such as  the III-RM), industry architectures, and 
enterprise architectures. The Architecture Continuum is a useful tool to discover commonality and eliminate unnecessary redundancy.

TOGAF® 9 Foundation Study Guide, 2nd Edition  61 6.4.3 The Solutions Continuum 
The Solutions Continuum provides a consis tent way to describe and understand the 
implementation of the assets defined in the Arch itecture Continuum. The Solutions Continuum 
defines what is available in the organizati onal environment as re-usable Solution Building 
Blocks (SBBs). The solutions are the results of agreements between customers and business 
partners that implement the rules and relations hips defined in the architecture space. The 
Solutions Continuum addresses the commonalities and differences among the products, systems, and services of implemented systems. 
6.5 The Architecture Continuum in Detail 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 5, Learning Outcome 6:  You should be able to explain the purpose of 
the Architecture Continuum.) 
There is a continuum of architectures, Archit ecture Building Blocks (ABBs), and architecture 
models that are relevant to the task of constr ucting an enterprise-specific architecture, that are 
termed by TOGAF as the Architecture Continuum. These are shown in Figure 11. 
 
Figure 11: The Architecture Continuum 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 5, Learning Outcom e 7: You should be able to list the stages of 
architecture evolution defined in the Architecture Continuum.)  
Figure 11 illustrates how architectures are deve loped and evolved acros s a continuum ranging 
from Foundation Architectures, such as the one provided by TOGAF, through Common Systems 
Architectures, and Industry Architectures, and to an enterprise's own Organization-Specific 
Architectures. 
The arrows in the Architecture Continuum repres ent the relationship that exists between the 
different architectures in the Architecture C ontinuum. The leftwards direction focuses on 
meeting enterprise needs and business requirement s, while the rightwards direction focuses on 
leveraging architectural components and building blocks. 
The enterprise needs and business requirements ar e addressed in increasing detail from left to 
right. The architect will typically look to find re-usable architecture elements toward the left of 
the continuum. When elements are not found, the requirements for the missing elements are 
passed to the left of the continuum for incorporation.

62  Study Guide (2011) Within the Architecture Continuum there are a number of re-usable Architecture Building 
Blocks (ABBs) – the models of architectures. 
6.5.1 Foundation Architecture 
A Foundation Architecture consists of generic co mponents, inter-relations hips, principles, and 
guidelines that provide a foundation on which more specific architectures can be built. 
6.5.2 Common Systems Architectures 
Common Systems Architectures guide the selection and integration of specific services from the Foundation Architecture to create an architecture useful for building common solutions across a 
wide number of relevant domains. Examples of Common Systems Architectures include Security Architecture, Management Architecture, Network Architecture, etc. 
The TOGAF Integrated Information Infrastruct ure Reference Model (III-RM) is a reference 
model that supports describing Common Systems Architecture in the Application domain that 
focuses on the requirements, building blocks, and standards relating to the vision of 
Boundaryless Information Flow. 
6.5.3 Industry Architectures 
Industry Architectures guide the integration of common systems components with industry-
specific components, and guide the creation of industry solutions for specific customer problems 
within a particular industry. 
A typical example of an industry-specific component is a data model representing the business 
functions and processes specific to a particular vertical industry, such as the Retail industry's 
“Active Store” architecture, or an Industry Ar chitecture that incorporates the Petrotechnical 
Open Software Corporation (POSC) ( www.posc.org ) data model. 
6.5.4 Organization-Sp ecific Architectures 
Organization-Specific Architectures describe and gui de the final deployment of user-written or 
third-party components that constitute effec tive solutions for particular enterprises. 
6.6 The Solutions Continuum in Detail 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 5, Learning Outcome 8:  You should be able to explain the purpose of 
the Solutions Continuum.)  
The Solutions Continuum, shown in Figure 12 , represents the implementations of the 
architectures at the corresponding levels of the Architecture Continuum. At each level in the 
Solutions Continuum there is a set of reference building blocks that represent a solution to the 
business requirements at that level. A populated Solutions Continuum can be regarded as a re-
use library.

TOGAF® 9 Foundation Study Guide, 2nd Edition  63 
 
Figure 12: The Solutions Continuum 
In Figure 12, moving from left-to-right increases the solution’s value; that is, products and 
services provide value in creating systems solutions . Systems solutions value is used to create 
industry solutions, and industry solutions are used  to create enterprise solutions (also termed 
customer solutions). The right-to-left dir ection increasingly focuses on addressing enterprise 
needs. 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 5, Learning Outcom e 9: You should be able to list the stages of 
architecture evolution defined in the Solutions Continuum.)  
The solution types within the Solutions Conti nuum are looked at in detail in the following 
sections. 
6.6.1 Foundation Solutions 
Foundation Solutions are highly generic concep ts, tools, products, services, and solution 
components that are the fundamental providers of capabilities. Services include professional 
services – such as training and consulting services – that ensure the maximum investment value 
from solutions in the shortest possible time; a nd support services – such as Help Desk – that 
ensure the maximum possible value from soluti ons (services that ensure timely updates and 
upgrades to the products and systems). 
Example Foundation Solutions would include programming languages, operating systems, 
foundational data structures (such as EDIFACT), generic approaches to organization structuring, 
foundational structures for organizing IT operations (such as ITIL), etc. 
6.6.2 Common Systems Solutions 
A Common Systems Solution is an implementation of a Common Systems Architecture and is comprised of a set of products and services, which may be certified or branded. It represents the 
highest common denominator for one or more solutions in the industry segments that the 
Common Systems Solution supports. 
Common Systems Solutions represent collections  of common requirements and capabilities, 
rather than those specific to a particular cu stomer or industry. Common Systems Solutions 
provide organizations with ope rating environments specific to operational and informational 
needs, such as high availability transaction pr ocessing and scalable data warehousing systems. 
Examples of Common Systems Solutions include: an enterprise management system product and 
a security system product.

64  Study Guide (2011) Computer systems vendors are the typical providers of technology-centric Common Systems 
Solutions. “Software as a service” vendors ar e typical providers of common application 
solutions. Business process outsourcing vendors are typical providers of business capability-
centric Common Systems Solutions. 
6.6.3 Industry Solutions 
An Industry Solution is an implementation of an  Industry Architecture, which provides re-usable 
packages of common components and services specific to an industry. 
Fundamental components are provided by Co mmon Systems Solutions and/or Foundation 
Solutions, and are augmented with industry-speci fic components. Examples include a physical 
database schema or an industry-specific point-of-service device. 
Industry Solutions are industry-specific, aggregate procurements that are ready to be tailored to 
an individual organization's requirements. 
In some cases an industry solution may include not only an implementation of the Industry 
Architecture, but also other solution elements, such as specific products, services, and systems 
solutions that are appropriate to that industry. 
6.6.4 Organization-Specific Solutions 
An Organization-Specific Solution is an im plementation of the Organization-Specific 
Architecture that provides the required business functions. Because solutions are designed for 
specific business operations, they contain the hi ghest amount of unique content in order to 
accommodate the varying people and processes of specific organizations. 
Building Organization-Specific Solutions on Industry Solutions, Common Systems Solutions, 
and Foundation Solutions is the usual way of connecting the Architecture Continuum to the 
Solutions Continuum, as guided by the architects within an enterprise. 
An Organization-Specific Solution will be structur ed in order to support specific Service-Level 
Agreements (SLAs) to ensure support of the ope rational systems at desired service levels. For 
example, a third-party application hosting provid er may offer different levels of support for 
operational systems. These agreements would defi ne the terms and conditions of that support. 
Other key factors to be defined within an Or ganization-Specific Solution are the key operating 
parameters and quality metrics that can be u sed to monitor and manage the environment. 
6.6.5 The Relationship of the Archit ecture Continuum to the Solutions 
Continuum 
The relationship between the Architecture Conti nuum and the Solutions Continuum is one of 
guidance, direction, and support. For example, Foundation Architectures guide the creation or 
selection of Foundation Solutions. Foundation Solu tions support the Foundation Architecture by 
helping to realize the architecture defined in the Architecture Continuum. The Foundation 
Architecture also guides development of Foundation Solutions, by providing architectural direction, requirements and principles that gui de selection, and realization of appropriate 
solutions. A similar relationship exists between th e other elements of the Enterprise Continuum.

6.7 Using the Enterprise Continuum within the ADM 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 5, Learning Outcom e 10: You should be able to explain the 
relationship between the Enterpri se Continuum and the TOGAF ADM.)  
The TOGAF Architecture Development Method (A DM) describes the process of moving from 
the TOGAF Foundation Architecture to an en terprise-specific architecture (or set of 
architectures). This process makes use of the elements of the TOGAF Foundation Architecture 
and other relevant architecture assets, component s, and building blocks. At relevant places 
throughout the TOGAF ADM, there are reminders to consider which architecture assets from the 
Enterprise Continuum the architect should use. TOGAF itself provides two reference models for 
consideration for inclusion in an organizati on's Enterprise Continuum: the TOGAF Foundation 
Architecture and the Integrated Informat ion Infrastructure Reference Model (III-RM).

66  Study Guide (2011) 6.8 The Architecture Repository 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 5, Learning Outcom e 11: You should be able to describe the 
Architecture Repository.)  
Operating a mature architecture capability within a large ente rprise creates a huge volume of 
architectural output. Effective management and le verage of these architectural work products 
require a formal taxonomy for different types of architectural asset alongside dedicated 
processes and tools for architectural content storage. 
TOGAF provides a structural framework for an Arch itecture Repository that allows an enterprise 
to distinguish between different types of archit ectural assets that exist at different levels of 
abstraction in the organization. This Architecture Repository is one part of the wider Enterprise 
Repository, which provides the capability to lin k architectural assets to components of the 
Detailed Design, Deployment, and Service Management Repositories. 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 5, Learning Outcom e 12: You should be able to explain the 
relationship between the Enterprise Con tinuum and the Arch itecture Repository.)  
The Architecture Repository is a model for a ph ysical instance of the Enterprise Continuum.

TOGAF® 9 Foundation Study Guide, 2nd Edition  67 (Syllabus Reference: Unit 5, Learning Outcome 13:  You should be able to describe the classes of 
information held in the Architecture Repository.)  
At a high level, six classes of architectural info rmation are expected to be held within an 
Architecture Repository: 
• The Architecture Metamodel  describes the organizationally tailored application of an 
architecture framework, including a method fo r architecture development and a metamodel 
for architecture content. 
• The Architecture Capability  defines the parameters, structures, and processes that support 
governance of the Architecture Repository. 
• The Architecture Landscape  presents an architectural representation of assets in use, or 
planned, by the enterprise at particular points in time. 
• The Standards Information Base  captures the standards with which new architectures 
must comply, which may include industry st andards, selected products and services from 
suppliers, or shared services already deploy ed within the organization. The Open Group 
provides an example of a Standards Information Base on its web site.9 
• The Reference Library  provides guidelines, templates, patterns, and other forms of 
reference material that can be leveraged in order to accelerate the creation of new 
architectures for the enterprise. 
• The Governance Log  provides a record of governance  activity across the enterprise. 
6.8.1 The Architecture Landscape 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 5, Learning Outcome 14: You should be able to list the three levels of 
the Architecture Landscape.)  
The Architecture Landscape holds architectural view s of the state of the enterprise at particular 
points in time. Due to the sheer volume and the diverse stakeholder needs throughout an entire 
enterprise, the Architecture Landscape is divi ded into three levels of granularity: 
1. Strategic Architectures show a long-term summary  view of the entire enterprise. Strategic 
Architectures provide an organizing framework  for operational and change activity and 
allow for direction setting at an executive level. 
2. Segment Architectures provide more detaile d operating models for areas within an 
enterprise. Segment Architectures can be used at the program or portfolio level to 
organize and operationally align more detailed change activity. 
3. Capability Architectures show in a more deta iled fashion how the enterprise can support a 
particular unit of capability. Capability Architect ures are used to provide an overview of 
current capability, target capability, and cap ability increments and allow for individual 
work packages and projects to be grouped within managed portfolios and programs.

68  Study Guide (2011) 6.8.2 The Standards Information Base 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 5, Learning Outcome 15:  You should be able to explain the purpose of 
the Standards Information Base w ithin the Architecture Repository.)  
The Standards Information Base is a repository ar ea that can hold a set of specifications, to 
which architectures must conform. 
Establishment of a Standards Information Base pr ovides an unambiguous basis for architectural 
governance since: 
• The standards are easily accessible to projects and therefore the obligations of the project 
can be understood and planned for. 
• Standards are stated in a clear and unambiguous manner, so that compliance can be 
objectively assessed. 
6.9 Tools Standardization 
To manage the content of the Enterprise Continuum we need tools in order to: 
• Promote re-use 
• Enable sharing of architecture information within an organization 
• Facilitate easier maintenance of the architecture 
• Ensure common terminology is used 
• Provide stakeholders w ith relevant models 
Using the models within TOGAF, it is then possi ble to implement the Architecture Repository in 
a tool, thereby responding to stakeholder enquiries for models, views, and other queries. 
6.10 Summary 
The Enterprise Continuum provides methods for cl assifying architecture and solution artifacts, 
both internal and external to the Architect ure Repository, as they evolve from generic 
Foundation Architectures to Organization-Specifi c Architectures. It is also an aid to 
communication between all architects involved in building and procuring an architecture by 
providing a common language and terminology. This , in turn, enables efficiency in engineering 
and effective use of COTS products. 
The Architecture Continuum is part of an orga nization’s Enterprise Continuum and is supported 
by the Solutions Continuum. It offers a consis tent way to define a nd understand the generic 
rules, representations, and relationships in an information system, and it represents a conceptual 
structuring of re-usable architecture assets. 
The Architecture Continuum shows the relati onships among Foundation Architectures (such as 
the TOGAF Foundation Architecture), Common Sy stems Architectures (such as the III-RM),

TOGAF® 9 Foundation Study Guide, 2nd Edition  69 Industry Architectures, and Organization-Specific Ar chitectures. It is also a useful method to 
discover commonality and eliminate unnecessary redundancy. 
The Solutions Continuum is part of an orga nization’s Enterprise Continuum. It represents 
implementations of the architectures at the corr esponding levels of the Architecture Continuum. 
At each level, the Solutions Continuum is a population of the architecture with reference 
building blocks – either purch ased products or built components – that represent a solution to the 
enterprise’s business needs. 
The Architecture Repository provides a structur al framework for a physical repository for 
managing architectural work products and is a m odel of a physical instance of the Enterprise 
Continuum. The Architecture Repository defines si x classes for architectural information held in 
the repository. 
TOGAF recognizes the need to manage the content of the Enterprise Continuum using tools, and 
includes high-level guidance on standardization of tools.

Chapter 7 The ADM Phases 
7.1 Key Learning Points 
This chapter will help you understand how each of  the ADM phases contributes to the success of 
enterprise architecture.  
Key Points Explained 
This chapter will help you to answer the following questions: 
• What are the objectives of each of the ADM phases? 
• What are the key aspects to the approach ta ken in each phase for enterprise architecture 
development? 
7.2 Preliminary Phase 
The Preliminary Phase includes the preparation and initiation activities to create an Architect ure Capability. Key activities 
are as follows: 
• Understand the business environment 
• Ensure high-level management commitment 
• Obtain agreement on scope 
• Establish architecture principles 
• Establish governance structure 
• Customization of TOGAF 
7.2.1 Objectives 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 6, Learning Outcom e P.1: You should be able to describe the 
objectives of the Preliminary Phase.)  
• Determine the Architecture Capability desired by the organization: 
— Review the organizational context for conducting enterprise architecture 
— Identify and scope the elements of the en terprise organizations affected by the 
Architecture Capability

TOGAF® 9 Foundation Study Guide, 2nd Edition  73 — Identify the established frameworks, methods , and processes that intersect with the 
Architecture Capability 
— Establish a Capability Maturity target 
• Establish the Architecture Capability: 
— Define and establish the Organizati onal Model for Enterprise Architecture 
— Define and establish the detailed process  and resources for architecture governance 
— Select and implement tools that support the Architecture Capability 
— Define the architecture principles (see Chapte r 8 for more information on architecture 
principles) 
7.2.2 Approach 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 6, Learning Outcome P. 2: You should be able to briefly explain the 
seven aspects of the approach undert aken in the Preliminary Phase.)  
The Preliminary Phase is about defining “where , what, why, who, and how we do architecture” 
in the enterprise concerned. Th e main aspects are as follows: 
• Defining the enterprise 
• Identifying key drivers and elements in the organizational context 
• Defining the requirements for architecture work 
• Defining the architecture principles that  will inform any architecture work 
• Defining the framework to be used 
• Defining the relationships be tween management frameworks 
• Evaluating the enterprise architecture’s maturity 
Defining the Enterprise 
One of the main challenges of enterprise architectur e is that of enterprise scope. The scope of the 
enterprise, and whether it is federated, will dete rmine those stakeholders who will derive most 
benefit from the new or enhanced enterprise architect ure. It is imperative to appoint a sponsor at 
this stage to ensure that the resultant activity has resources to proceed and the clear support of 
the business management. The enterprise may includ e many organizations and the duties of the 
sponsor are to ensure that all stakeholders ar e included in defining, establishing, and using the 
Architecture Capability. 
Identifying Key Drivers and Elements in the Organizational Context 
It is necessary to understand the contex t surrounding the architecture. For example, 
considerations include: 
Personal PDF Edition 
© 2011 The Open Group, All Rights Reserved
Personal PDF Edition. Not for redistribution
 
74  Study Guide (2011) • The commercial models and budget for the enterprise architecture 
• The stakeholders 
• The intentions and culture of the organization 
• Current processes that support execution of change and operation of the enterprise 
• The Baseline Architecture landscape 
• The skills and capabilities of the enterprise 
Review of the organizational context should prov ide valuable requirements on how to tailor the 
architecture framework, particularly the level of  formality, the expenditure required, and contact 
with other organizations. 
Defining the Requirements for Architecture Work 
Business imperatives drive the requirements and performance metrics. One or more of the 
following requirements need to be articulated so  that the sponsor can identify the key decision-
makers and stakeholders invol ved in defining and establishing the Architecture Capability: 
• Business requirements 
• Cultural aspirations 
• Organization intents 
• Strategic intent 
• Forecast financial requirements 
Defining the Architecture Principles that will Inform any Architecture Work 
The definition of architecture principles is f undamental to the development of an enterprise 
architecture. Architecture work is inform ed by business principles as well as architecture 
principles. The architecture principles themselve s are also normally based in part on business 
principles. 
note
 Architecture principles are covered in further detail in Chapter 8. 
Defining the Framework to be Used 
The ADM is a generic method, intended to be u sed by enterprises in a wide variety of industry 
types and geographies. It can also be used with  a wide variety of other enterprise architecture 
frameworks, if required. TOGAF has to co-exist  with and enhance the operational capabilities of 
other frameworks in use within an organization.  The main frameworks that may need to be 
coordinated with TOGAF are: 
Personal PDF Edition 
© 2011 The Open Group, All Rights Reserved
Personal PDF Edition. Not for redistribution
 
TOGAF® 9 Foundation Study Guide, 2nd Edition  75 • Business Capability Management  (Business Direction and Planning) which determine 
what business capabilities are required. 
• Portfolio/Project Management Methods  which determine how a company manages its 
change initiatives. 
• Operations Management Methods  which describe how a company runs its day-to-day 
operations, including IT. 
• Solution Development Methods  which formalize the way that business systems are 
delivered. 
As illustrated in Figure 15, th ese frameworks are not discrete, a nd there are significant overlaps 
between them and the Business Capability Manage ment. Consequently, an enterprise architect 
must be aware of the impact that the architecture has on the entire enterprise. 
 
Figure 15: Management Frameworks  to Coordinate with TOGAF 
Defining the Relationships between Management Frameworks 
Figure 16 shows a more detailed set of depe ndencies between the various frameworks and 
business planning activity. The enterprise architectur e can be used to provide a structure for all 
of the corporate initiatives.

Figure 16: Interoperability and Relation ships between Management Frameworks 
The management frameworks are required to comple ment each other and work in close harmony 
for the good of the enterprise. 
Evaluating the Enterprise Architecture Maturity 
Capability Maturity Models (CMMs) are a good way of assessing the ability of an enterprise to 
exercise different capabilities. Capability Maturity Models typically identify selected factors that 
are required to exercise a capability. An orga nization’s ability to execute specific factors 
provides a measure of maturity and can be used  to recommend a series of sequential steps to 
improve a capability. It is an assessment that giv es executives an insight into pragmatically 
improving a capability.

7.3 Phase A: Architecture Vision 
Phase A is about project establishment and initiates an iteration of 
the Architecture Development Cycle, setting the scope, 
constraints, and expectations for the iteration. 
It is required at the start of every architecture cycle in order to 
create the Architecture Vision, va lidate the business context, and 
create the approved Statement of Architecture Work. 
7.3.1 Objectives 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 6, Learning Outcome A.1: You should be able to describe the main objectives of Phase A.)  
• Develop a high-level aspirational vision of the capabilities 
and business value to be delivered as a result of the proposed enterprise architecture 
• Obtain approval for a Statement of Architectur e Work that defines a program of works to 
develop and deploy the architecture outlined in the Architecture Vision 
7.3.2 Approach 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 6, Learning Outcome A. 2: You should be able to briefly explain the 
two main aspects of the approach for Phase A.)  
Phase A starts with receipt of a Request for Ar chitecture Work from the sponsoring organization 
to the architecture organization. A key objective is  to ensure proper recognition and endorsement 
from corporate management, and the support a nd commitment of line management for this 
evolution of the ADM cycle. 
As the name of the phase suggests, creating the Architecture Vision is a key activity in this 
phase. This is discussed below, as is the busin ess scenarios technique which can be used to 
develop the Architecture Vision. 
Creating the Architecture Vision 
The Architecture Vision provides the sponsor with a key tool to sell the benefits of the proposed 
capability to stakeholders and decision-makers w ithin the enterprise. It describes how the new 
capability will meet the business goals and strate gic objectives and address the stakeholder 
concerns when implemented. 
Normally, key elements of the Architecture Visi on – such as the enterprise mission, vision, 
strategy, and goals – have been documented as part  of some wider business strategy or enterprise 
planning activity that has its own lifecycle within  the enterprise. In su ch cases, the activity in 
Phase A is concerned with verifying and unde rstanding the documented business strategy and 
goals. Phase A may also integrate the enterprise st rategy and goals with the strategy and goals 
implicit within the current architecture.

Personal PDF Edition. Not for redistribution
 
78  Study Guide (2011) In other cases, little or no Business Architecture work may have been done to date. In such 
cases, there will be a need for the architecture team  to research, verify, and gain buy-in to the 
key business objectives and processes that the archit ecture is to support. This may be done as a 
free-standing exercise, either preceding architecture development, or as part of the ADM 
initiation phase (Preliminary Phase). 
Business scenarios (see below) are an appropriate and useful technique to discover and 
document business requirements, and to articulate an Architecture Vision that responds to those 
requirements. 
The Architecture Vision provides a first-cut, hi gh-level description of the Baseline and Target 
Architectures, covering the Business, Data, App lication, and Technology  domains. These outline 
descriptions are developed in subsequent phases. 
Once an Architecture Vision is defined and documented in the Statement of Architecture Work, 
it is critical to use it to build a consensus. Withou t this consensus it is very unlikely that the final 
architecture will be accepted by the organization as a whole. The consensus is represented by the 
sponsoring organization signing the Statement of Architecture Work. 
Business Scenarios 
The ADM has its own method (a “method-within-a -method”) for identifying and articulating the 
business requirements implied, and the implied architecture requirements. This technique is 
known as “business scenarios”, and is described in  detail in Chapter 8. The technique may be 
used iteratively, at different levels of detail in  the hierarchical decomposition of the Business 
Architecture.

TOGAF® 9 Foundation Study Guide, 2nd Edition  79 7.4 Phase B: Business Architecture 
Phase B is about development of a Business Architecture to 
support an agreed Architecture Vision. 
This describes the fundamental organization of a business 
embodied in: 
• Its business process and people 
• Their relationships to each other and the people 
• The principles governing its design and evolution 
and shows how an organization meets its business goals. 
7.4.1 Objectives 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 6, Learning Outcome B. 1: You should be able to describe the main 
objectives of Phase B.)  
• Develop the Target Business Architecture describ ing how the enterprise needs to operate to 
achieve the business goals, responds to the strategic drivers set out in the Architecture 
Vision, and addresses the Request for Architecture Work and stakeholder concerns 
• Identify candidate Architecture Roadmap components based upon gaps between the 
Baseline and Target Business Architectures 
7.4.2 Approach 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 6, Learning Outcome B. 2: You should be able to explain the main 
aspects of the approach in Phase B.)  
In summary, the Business Architecture describes the product and/or service strategy, and the 
organizational, functional, process, informa tion, and geographic aspects of the business 
environment. 
A knowledge of the Business Architecture is a prer equisite for architecture work in any other 
domain (Data, Application, Technol ogy), and is therefore the first architecture activity that needs 
to be undertaken. 
In practical terms, the Business Architecture is often necessary as a means of demonstrating the 
business value of subsequent architecture work to key stakeholders, and the return on investment 
to those stakeholders from supporting and participating in the subsequent work. 
Developing the Baseline Description 
If an enterprise has existing architecture descripti ons, they should be used as the basis for the 
Baseline Description. Where no such descriptions ex ist, information will have to be gathered in 
whatever format comes to hand. 
Personal PDF Edition

Personal PDF Edition. Not for redistribution
 
80  Study Guide (2011) The normal approach to Target Architecture development is top-down. In the Baseline 
Description, however, the analysis of the current state often has to be done bottom-up, particularly where little or no architecture assets exis t. In such a case, the architect simply has to 
document the working assumptions about high-leve l architectures, and the process is one of 
gathering evidence to turn the working assumptions into fact. 
Business Modeling 
Business models should be extensions of busin ess scenarios developed during the Architecture 
Vision. A variety of modeling tools and techniques may be used. Such as Activity Models  (also 
called Business Process Models ), Use-Case Models , and Class Models.  All three types of 
model can be represented in the Unified Modeling Language (UML), and a variety of tools exist 
for generating such models. The Defense sector also uses Node Connectivity Diagrams  and 
Information Exchange Matrices . 
Using the Architecture Repository 
The architecture team will need to  consider what relevant Busi ness Architecture resources are 
available from the Architecture Repository, in particular: 
• Generic business models relevant to the or ganization's industry sector; these are called 
“Industry Architectures” 
• Business models relevant to common high-level business domains (for example, electronic 
commerce, supply chain management, etc.); these are called “Common Systems Architectures” 
• Enterprise-specific building blocks (process co mponents, business rules, job descriptions, 
etc.) 
• Applicable standards

TOGAF® 9 Foundation Study Guide, 2nd Edition  81 7.5 Phase C: Information Systems 
Architectures 
Phase C is about documenting the Information Systems 
Architectures for an architecture project, including the development of Data and Application Architectures. This describes the major types of information and the application systems that process the information, and their relationships to 
each other and the environment. 
There are two steps in this phase, which may be developed either 
sequentially or concurrently: 
• Data Architecture 
• Application Architecture 
7.5.1 Objectives 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 6, Learning Outcome C. 1: You should be able to describe the main 
objectives of Phase C.)  
• Develop the Target Information Systems (Data and Application) Architecture, describing 
how the enterprise's Information System s Architecture will enable the Business 
Architecture and the Architecture Vision, in a way that addresses the Request for 
Architecture Work and stakeholder concerns. 
• Identify candidate Architecture Roadmap components based upon gaps between the 
Baseline and Target Information Systems (Data and Application) Architectures. 
note
 Consistency of Phases B, C, and D 
As noted in Section 5.2, the architectures de veloped in Phases B, C, and D follow a uniform 
step pattern, including development of Base line and Target Architecture descriptions and 
analysis of the gaps. The details are out of  scope for TOGAF 9 Foundation, and are covered 
instead in Level 2.

82  Study Guide (2011) Key Considerations for the Data Architecture 
Key considerations for the Data Architecture include: 
• Data Management 
When an enterprise has chosen to undertake la rge-scale architectural transformation, it is 
important to understand and address data management issues. A structured and 
comprehensive approach to data management en ables the effective use of data to capitalize 
on its competitive advantages. 
Considerations include: 
— Defining application components which will serve as the system of record or reference 
for enterprise master data 
— Defining enterprise-wide standards that all application components, including software 
packages, need to adopt 
— Understanding how data entities are utilized  by business functions, processes, and 
services 
— Understanding how and where ente rprise data entities are created, stored, transported, 
and reported 
— Understanding the level and complexity of da ta transformations required to support the 
information exchange needs between applications 
— Defining the requirement for software in  supporting data integration with the 
enterprise's customers and suppliers (e.g., use of ETL10 tools during the data migration, 
data profiling tools to evaluate data quality, etc.) 
• Data Migration 
When an existing application is replaced, th ere will be a critical need to migrate data 
(master, transactional, and reference) to the new application. The Data Architecture should 
identify data migration requirements and also provide indicators as to the level of transformation, weeding, and cleansing that will be required to present data in a format that 
meets the requirements and constraints of the ta rget application. The objective is to ensure 
that the target application has quality data when it is populated. Another key consideration 
is to ensure that an enterprise-wide common data definition is esta blished to support the 
transformation. 
• Data Governance 
Considerations for data governance should en sure that the ente rprise has the necessary 
dimensions in place to enable the transformation, as follows: 
                                                 
 
10 ETL is an abbreviation for Extract, Transform, and Load.

TOGAF® 9 Foundation Study Guide, 2nd Edition  83 — Structure : Does the enterprise have the necessary organizational structure and the 
standards bodies to manage data entity aspects of the transformation? 
— Management System : Does the enterprise have the necessary management system and 
data-related programs to mana ge the governance aspects of data entities throughout its 
lifecycle? 
— People : What data-related skills and roles does the enterprise require for the 
transformation? If the enterprise lacks such  resources and skills, the enterprise should 
consider either acquiring those critical skills or training existing internal resources to 
meet the requirements through a well-defined learning program. 
Using the Architecture Repository 
As part of this phase, the architecture team shoul d consider what relevant Data Architecture and 
Application Architecture resources are available in  the organization's Architecture Repository; in 
particular, generic models relevant to the orga nization's industry “vertical” sector. For example: 
• Data Architecture models: 
— ARTS has defined a data model for the Retail industry. 
— Energistics has defined a data model for the Petrotechnical industry. 
• Application Architecture models: 
— The TeleManagement Forum (TMF) – www.tmforum.org  – has developed detailed 
applications models relevant to the Telecommunications industry. 
— The Object Management Group (OMG) – www.omg.org  – has a number of vertical 
Domain Task Forces developing software mode ls relevant to specific vertical domains 
such as Healthcare, Transportation, Finance, etc. 
— Application models relevant to comm on high-level business functions, such as 
electronic commerce, supply chain management, etc. 
The Open Group has a Reference Model for Integr ated Information Infr astructure (III-RM) that 
focuses on the application-level components and se rvices necessary to provide an integrated 
information infrastructure.

84  Study Guide (2011) 7.6 Phase D: Technology Architecture 
Phase D is about documenting the Technology Architecture for 
an architecture project, in th e form of the fundamental 
organization of the IT systems: 
• Embodied in the hardware, software, and communications 
technology 
• Their relationships to each other and the environment 
• The principles governing its design and evolution 
7.6.1 Objectives 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 6, Learning Outcome D.1: You should 
be able to describe the main objectives of Phase D.)  
• Develop the Target Technology Architecture that enables the logical and physical 
application and data components and the Architecture Vision, addressing the Request for 
Architecture Work and stakeholder concerns 
• Identify candidate Architecture Roadmap components based upon gaps between the 
Baseline and Target Technology Architectures 
7.6.2 Approach 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 6, Learning Outcome D. 2: You should be able to briefly explain the 
approach to Phase D.) 
Using the Architecture Repository 
As part of Phase D, the architecture team must  consider what relevant Technology Architecture 
resources are available in the Architectur e Repository. In particular, consider: 
• Existing IT services 
• The TOGAF Technical Reference Model (TRM) 
• Generic technology models relevant to the organization's industry “vertical” sector; for 
example, in the telecommunications industry such models have been developed by the 
TeleManagement Forum (TMF) 
•  Technology models relevant to Common Sy stems Architectures; for example, the III-RM.

TOGAF® 9 Foundation Study Guide, 2nd Edition  85 7.7 Phase E: Opportunities and Solutions 
Phase E is the first phase which is directly concerned with 
implementation. It describes the process of identifying major implementation projects and grouping them into work 
packages that deliver the Targ et Architecture identified in 
previous phases. 
Key activities are as follows: 
• Perform initial implementation planning 
• Identify the major implementation projects 
• Group changes into work packages 
• Decide on approach: 
— Make versus  buy versus  re-use 
— Outsource 
— COTS 
— Open Source 
• Assess priorities 
• Identify dependencies 
7.7.1 Objectives 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 6, Learning Outcome E. 1: You should be able to describe the main 
objectives of Phase E.) 
• Generate the initial complete version of the Architecture Roadmap, based upon the gap 
analysis and candidate Architecture Roadmap components from Phases B, C, and D 
• Determine whether an incremental approach is required, and if so identify Transition 
Architectures that will deli ver continuous business value 
7.7.2 Approach 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 6, Learning Outcome E. 2: You should be able to briefly explain the 
approach to Phase E.) 
Phase E concentrates on how to deliver the architectur e. It takes into account the complete set of 
gaps between the Target and Baseline Architectures in all architecture domains, and logically 
groups changes into work packages w ithin the enterprise’s portfolios. This is an effort to build a 
best-fit roadmap that is based upon the stake holder requirements, the enterprise’s business 
transformation readiness, identified opportuniti es and solutions, and identified implementation 
constraints. The key is to focus on the final ta rget while realizing incremental business value.

86  Study Guide (2011) Phase E is the initial step on the creation of a well considered Implem entation and Migration 
Plan that is integrated into th e enterprise’s portfolio in Phase F. 
There are four key concepts in the trans ition from developing to delivering a Target 
Architecture: 
• Architecture Roadmap 
• Work Packages 
• Transition Architectures 
• Implementation and Migration Plan 
The Architecture Roadmap lists individual work packages in a timeline that will realize the 
Target Architecture. Each wo rk package identifies a logical  group of changes necessary to 
realize the Target Architecture. A Transiti on Architecture describes the enterprise at an 
architecturally significant state between the Baseline and Target Architectures. Transition 
Architectures provide interim Target Architect ures upon which the organization can converge. 
The Implementation and Migration Plan provides a schedule of the projects that will realize the 
Target Architecture.

TOGAF® 9 Foundation Study Guide, 2nd Edition  87 7.8 Phase F: Migration Planning 
Phase F addresses detailed migration planning; that is, how to 
move from the Baseline to the Target Architectures. 
Key activities include: 
• For work packages and projects identified, perform a 
cost/benefit analysis and a risk assessment 
• Finalize a detailed Implemen tation and Migration Plan 
7.8.1 Objectives 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 6, Learning Outcome F.1: You should 
be able to describe the main objectives for Phase F.) 
• Finalize the Architecture Roadmap and the supporting Implementation and Migration Plan 
• Ensure that the Implementation and Migration Plan is coordinated with the enterprise’s 
approach to managing and implementing change in the enterprise’s overall change portfolio 
• Ensure that the business value and cost of work packages and Transition Architectures is 
understood by key stakeholders 
7.8.2 Approach 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 6, Learning Outcome F. 2: You should be able to briefly explain the 
approach to Phase F.) 
The focus of Phase F is the creation of an Impl ementation and Migration Plan in co-operation 
with the portfolio and project managers. Phase E provides an incomplete Architecture Roadmap 
and Implementation and Migration Plan that address the Request for Architecture Work. In 
Phase F this Roadmap and the Implementation a nd Migration Plan are integrated with the 
enterprise's other change activity. Activities include assessing the dependencies, costs, and 
benefits of the various migration projects. Th e Architecture Roadmap, and Implementation and 
Migration Plan, from Phase E will form the basi s of the detailed Implementation and Migration 
Plan that will include portfolio and project-lev el detail. The architecture development cycle 
should then be completed, and lessons learne d documented to enable continuous process 
improvement.

88  Study Guide (2011) 7.9 Phase G: Implementation Governance 
Phase G defines how the architecture constrains the 
implementation projects, monitors it while building it, and 
produces a signed Architecture Contract. 
Key activities include: 
• Provide architectural oversight for the implementation 
• Define architecture constraints on implementation projects 
• Govern and manage an Architecture Contract 
• Monitor implementation work for conformance 
7.9.1 Objectives 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 6, Learning Outcome G. 1: You should be able to describe the main 
objectives of Phase G.)  
• Ensure conformance with the Target Architecture by implementation projects 
• Perform appropriate Architecture Governance functions for the solution and any 
implementation-driven architecture Change Requests 
7.9.2 Approach 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 6, Learning Outcome G. 2: You should be able to briefly explain the 
approach to Phase G.) 
In Phase G all the information for successful management of the various implementation 
projects is brought together. The actual deve lopment occurs in parallel with Phase G.  
The approach in Phase G is to: 
• Establish an implementation program that will enable the delivery of the agreed Transition 
Architectures 
• Adopt a phased deployment schedule that reflects the business priorities embodied in the 
Architecture Roadmap 
• Follow the organization's standard for co rporate, IT, and Architecture Governance 
• Use the organization's established portfolio/p rogram management approach, where this 
exists 
• Define an operations framework to ensure the effective long life of the deployed solution 
A key aspect of Phase G is ensuring compliance with  the defined architecture(s), not only by the 
implementation projects, but also by other ongoing projects.

TOGAF® 9 Foundation Study Guide, 2nd Edition  89 7.10 Phase H: Architecture Change Management 
Phase H ensures that changes to th e architecture are managed in a 
controlled manner. 
Key activities include: 
• Provide continual monitoring and a change management 
process 
• Ensure that changes to the architecture are managed in a 
cohesive and architected way 
• Provide flexibility to evolve rapidly in response to changes in 
the technology or business environment 
• Monitor the business and capacity management 
7.10.1 Objectives 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 6, Learning Outcome H. 1: You should be able to describe the main 
objectives of Phase G.)  
• Ensure that the architecture lifecycle is maintained 
• Ensure that the Architecture Governance Framework is executed 
• Ensure that the enterprise's Architect ure Capability meets current requirements 
7.10.2 Approach 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 6, Learning Outcome H. 2: You should be able to briefly explain the 
approach to Phase H.) 
The goal of an architecture change management  process is to ensure that the architecture 
achieves its original target business value. Mon itoring business growth and decline is a critical 
aspect of this phase. 
The value and change management process, once established, will determine: 
• The circumstances under which the enterprise architecture, or parts of it, will be permitted 
to change after deployment, and th e process by which that will happen 
• The circumstances under which the Architecture Development Cycle will be initiated to 
develop a new architecture 
Drivers for Change 
There are three ways to change the existing infrastructure that have to be integrated: 
1. Strategic, top-down directed change to enhance or create new capability (capital) 
Personal PDF Edition

Personal PDF Edition. Not for redistribution
 
90  Study Guide (2011) 2. Bottom-up changes to correct or enhance cap ability (operations and maintenance) for 
infrastructure under operations management 
3. Experiences with the previously delivered pr oject increments in the care of operations 
management, but still being delivered by ongoing projects 
Enterprise Architecture Change Management Process 
The enterprise architecture change management process needs to determine how changes are to 
be managed, what techniques are to be applied, and what methodologies used. 
TOGAF recommends the following approach based  on classifying the required architectural 
changes into one of three categories: 
• Simplification change : A simplification change can normally be handled via change 
management techniques. 
• Incremental change : An incremental change may be cap able of being handled via change 
management techniques, or it may require partia l re-architecting, depending on the nature of 
the change (see Guidelines for Maintenance versus Architecture Redesign for guidance). 
• Re-architecting change : A re-architecting change requires putting the whole architecture 
through the Architecture Development Cycle again. 
Another way of looking at these three choices is as follows: 
• A simplification change to an architecture is often driven by a requirement to reduce 
investment. 
• An incremental change is driven by a requir ement to derive additional value from existing 
investment. 
• A re-architecting change is driven by a require ment to increase investment in order to create 
new value for exploitation. 
To determine whether a change is simplification,  incremental, or re-architecting, the following 
activities are undertaken: 
1. Registration of all events that may impact the architecture 
2. Resource allocation and management for architecture tasks 
3. The process or role responsible for architect ure resources has to make an assessment of 
what should be done 
4. Evaluation of impacts 
Guidelines for Maintenance versus Architecture Redesign 
A good rule-of-thumb is: 
• If the change impacts two stakeholders or more , then it is likely to require an architecture 
redesign and re-entry to the ADM.

TOGAF® 9 Foundation Study Guide, 2nd Edition  91 • If the change impacts only one stakeholder, th en it is more likely to be a candidate for 
change management. 
• If the change can be allowed under a dispensation,  then it is more likely to be a candidate 
for change management. 
For example: 
• If the impact is significant for the business stra tegy, then there may be a need to re-do the 
whole enterprise architecture – thus a re-architecting approach. 
• If a new technology or a standard emerges, then there may be a need to refresh the 
Technology Architecture, but not the whole enterprise architecture – thus an incremental change. 
• If the change is at an infrastructure level – fo r example, ten systems reduced or changed to 
one system – this may not change the architecture above the physical layer, but it will change the Baseline Description of the T echnology Architecture. This would be a 
simplification change handled via change management techniques. 
In particular, a refreshment cycle (partial or co mplete re-architecting) may be required if: 
• The Foundation Architecture needs to be re-aligned with the business strategy. 
• Substantial change is required to component s and guidelines for use in deployment of the 
architecture. 
• Significant standards used in the product ar chitecture are changed which have significant 
end-user impact; e.g., regulatory changes. 
If there is a need for a refreshment cycle, then  a new Request for Architecture Work must be 
issued (to move to another cycle).

92  Study Guide (2011) 7.11 Requirements Management 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 6, Learning Outcome R.1: You should 
be able to briefly explain how  Requirements Management fits 
into the ADM cycle.) 
The process of managing architecture requirements applies to all 
phases of the ADM cycle. The Requirements Management 
process is a dynamic process, which addresses the identification 
of requirements for the enterpri se, stores them, and then feeds 
them in and out of the relevant ADM phases. 
As shown by its central placement in the ADM cycle diagram, 
this process is central to driving the ADM process. 
7.11.1 Objectives 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 6, Learning Outcome R. 2: You should be able to describe the nature 
of the Requirements Management process.) 
• Ensure that the Requirements Management pro cess is sustained and operates for all relevant 
ADM phases 
• Manage architecture requirements identified during any execution of the ADM cycle or a 
phase 
• Ensure that the relevant architecture require ments are available for use by each phase as the 
phase is executed 
7.11.2 Approach 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 6, Learning Outcom e R.3: You should be able to describe the 
approach to Requirements Management.) 
The ADM is continuously driven by the Require ments Management process. The ability to deal 
with changes in requirements is crucial, as arch itecture by its nature deals with uncertainty and 
change, bridging the divide between the aspirat ions of the stakeholders and what can be 
delivered as a practical solution. 
 Requirements Management Manages the Flow of Requirements 
Note that the Requirements Management process it self does not dispose of, address, or prioritize 
any requirements; this is done with in the relevant phase of the ADM. 
It is recommended that a Requirements Repository is  used to record and manage all architecture 
requirements. TOGAF does not mandate or recommend any specific process or tool for 
requirements management; it simply states what an effective Requirement s Management process 
should achieve, which could be thought of  as “the requirements for requirements”.

TOGAF® 9 Foundation Study Guide, 2nd Edition  93 TOGAF suggests a number of resources in this area: 
Business Scenarios 
Business scenarios are an appropriate and usef ul technique to disc over and document business 
requirements, and to describe an Architectur e Vision that responds to those requirements. 
Business scenarios are described in detail in TOGAF 9 Part III: ADM Guidelines and 
Techniques, Chapter 26 (Business Scenarios). 
Other Requirements Tools 
There is a large and increasing, number of Comme rcial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) tools available

8.3 Architecture Principles 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 7, Learning Outcome 2: You should be able to briefly explain the need 
for architecture principles and where they are used within TOGAF.) 
Architecture principles are a set of general rules and guidelines for the architecture being 
developed. 
They are intended to be enduring and seldom amended, and inform and support the way in 
which an organization sets about fulfilling its mission.  Often they are one element of a structured 
set of ideas that collectively define and guide the organization, from values through to actions 
and results. 
Principles are an initial output of the Prelim inary Phase and are used throughout the ADM to 
provide a framework for guiding decision-making within the enterprise. 
Depending on the organization, principles may be  established within different domains and at 
different levels. Two key domains inform the development and utilization of architecture: 
• Enterprise principles provide a basis for decision-making throughout an enterprise and 
dictate how the organization fulfills its missi on. Such principles are commonly used as a 
means of harmonizing decision-making. They are a key element in a successful Architecture Governance strategy. Within the br oad domain of enterprise principles, it is 
common to have subsidiary principles within a business or organizational unit; for example 
IT, HR, domestic operations, or overseas operations.

TOGAF® 9 Foundation Study Guide, 2nd Edition  99 • Architecture principles are a set of principles that relate to architecture work. They reflect 
consensus across the enterprise, and embody the spirit of the enterprise architecture. 
Architecture principles govern the architect ure process, affecting the development, 
maintenance, and use of the enterprise architecture. 
 TOGAF 9 Part III: ADM Guidelines and Tec hniques contains guidelines for developing 
principles and a detailed set of generic architecture principles. 
8.3.1 The TOGAF Template for Defining Architecture Principles 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 7, Learning Outcome 3:  You should be able to describe the standard 
template for architecture principles.) 
TOGAF defines a standard way of describing prin ciples, as shown in Table 9. In addition to a 
definition statement, each principle should have  associated rationale and implication statements, 
both to promote understanding and acceptance of th e principles themselves, and to support the 
use of the principles in explaining and ju stifying why specific decisions are made. 
Table 9: TOGAF Template for Defining Principles 
Section Description 
Name Should represent both the essence of the rule and be easy to remember. Specific 
technology platforms should not be mentioned in the name or statement of a principle. 
Avoid ambiguous words in the name and in the statement such as: “support”, “open”, 
“consider”, and for lack of good measure th e word “avoid”, itself, be careful with 
“manage(ment)”, and look for unn ecessary adjectives and adverbs. 
Statement Should succinctly and unambiguously communicat e the fundamental rule. For the most 
part, the principle’s statements for managing information are similar among 
organizations. It is vital that the statement be unambiguous. 
Rationale Should highlight the business benefits of adhering to the principle, using business 
terminology. Point to the similarity of information and technology principles to the 
principles governing business operations. Also describe the relationship to other 
principles, and the intentions regarding a balanced interpretation. Describe situations 
where one principle would be given precedence or carry more weight than another for making a decision. 
Implications Should highlight the requirements, both for the business and IT, for carrying out the 
principle – in terms of resources, costs, and ac tivities/tasks. It will often be apparent that 
current systems, standards, or practices w ould be incongruent with the principle upon 
adoption. The impact on the business and consequences of adopting a principle should 
be clearly stated. The reader should readily discern the answer to: “How does this affect 
me?” It is important not to oversimplify, tr ivialize, or judge the merit of the impact. 
Some of the implications will be identified as potential impacts only, and may be 
speculative rather than fully analyzed.

Statement Customers should be able to serve themselves. 
Rationale Applying this principle will improve customer satisfaction, reduce administrative 
overhead, and potentially improve revenue. 
Implications There is an implication to improve ease- of-use and minimize training needs; for 
example, members should be able to update th eir contact details, etc. and be able to buy 
additional membership products online. 
8.3.2 What Makes a Good Architecture Principle? 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 7, Learning Outcome 4:  You should be able to explain what makes a 
good architecture principle.) 
There are five criteria that distinguish a good set of principles, as shown in Table 10. 
Table 10: Recommended Criteri a for Quality Principles 
Criteria Description 
Understandability The underlying tenets of a principle can be quickly grasped and understood by 
individuals throughout the organization. The intention of the principle is clear 
and unambiguous, so that violations, whether intentional or not, are minimized. 
Robustness Principles should enable good quality decisions about architectures and plans to 
be made, and enforceable policies and st andards to be created. Each principle 
should be sufficiently definitive and precise to support consistent decision-
making in complex, potentially controversial situations. 
Completeness Every potentially important principle governing the management of information 
and technology for the organization is defined. The principles cover every 
situation perceived. 
Consistency Strict adherence to one principle may require a loose interpretation of another 
principle. The set of principles must be expressed in a way that allows a balance 
of interpretations. Principles should not be contradictory to the point where 
adhering to one principle would violate the spirit of another. Every word in a 
principle statement should be carefully ch osen to allow consistent yet flexible 
interpretation. 
Stability Principles should be enduring, yet able to accommodate changes. An 
amendment process should be established for adding, removing, or altering 
principles after they are ratified initially. 
8.4 Business Scenarios 
8.4.1 What is a Business Scenario? 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 7, Learning Ou tcome 5: You should understand what a business 
scenario is and its purpose.) 
A key factor in the success of any other major pr oject is the extent to which it is linked to 
business requirements, and demonstrably supports  and enables the enterprise to achieve its

TOGAF® 9 Foundation Study Guide, 2nd Edition  101 business objectives. Business scenarios are a techni que used to help iden tify and understand the 
business requirements that an architecture must address. 
A business scenario describes: 
• A business process, application, or set of applications 
• The business and technology environment 
• The people and computing components (“actors”) who execute the scenario 
• The desired outcome of proper execution 
The technique may be used iteratively, at diffe rent levels of detail in the hierarchical 
decomposition of the Business Architecture. The generic business scenario process is as follows: 
1. Identify, document, and rank the problem that is driving the project 
2. Document, as high-level architecture models , the business and technical environments 
where the problem situation is occurring 
3. Identify and document desired objectives; the results of handling the problems 
successfully 
4. Identify human actors and their place in the business model, the human participants, and 
their roles 
5. Identify computer actors and their place in the technology model, the computing elements, 
and their roles 
6. Identify and document roles, responsibilities,  and measures of success per actor, the 
required scripts per actor, and the desired results of handling the situation properly 
7. Check for fitness-for-purpose of inspiring subse quent architecture work, and refine only if 
necessary 
This is also summarized in Figure 17.

Figure 17: The Business Scenario Process 
A good business scenario represents a significant business need or problem, and enables vendors 
to understand the value of a solution to th e customer. A good business scenario is also 
“SMART”: 
• Specific, by defining what needs to be done 
• Measurable, through clear metrics for success 
• Actionable, by clearly segmenting the problem and providing the basis for a solution 
• Realistic, in that the problem can be solved w ithin the bounds of physical reality, time, and 
cost constraints 
• Time-bound, in that there is a clear statement of when the opportunity expires 
8.4.2 The Use of Business Scenarios in the ADM 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 7, Learning Outcome 6: You should be able to explain where business 
scenarios are used within the ADM cycle.) 
Business scenarios figure most prominently in the initial phase of an ADM cycle, Architecture 
Vision, when they are used to define relevant business requirements, and to  build consensus with 
business management and other stakeholders. 
They may also be used in other phases, particul arly during Business Architecture, to derive the 
characteristics of the architecture directly from the high-level requirements of the business. 
Because business requirements are important throughout all phases of the ADM cycle, the 
business scenario technique has an important role to play in the TOGAF ADM, by ensuring that 
the business requirements themselves are complete and correct.

TOGAF® 9 Foundation Study Guide, 2nd Edition  103 8.5 Gap Analysis 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 7, Learning Outcome 7:  You should be able to explain the purpose of 
gap analysis.) 
The technique known as gap analysis is widely used  in the ADM to validate an architecture that 
is being developed. A key step in validating an architecture is to consider what may have been 
forgotten. The architecture must support all of the essential information processing needs of the 
organization. The most critical source of gaps th at should be considered is stakeholder concerns 
that have not been addressed in prior architectural work. 
The basic premise is to highlight a shortfall between the Baseline Architecture and the Target 
Architecture; that is, items that have been deliberately omitted, accidentally left out, or not yet 
defined. 
Potential sources of gaps include: 
• Business domain gaps: 
— People gaps (e.g., cross-training requirements) 
— Process gaps (e.g., process inefficiencies) 
— Tools gaps (e.g., duplicate or  missing tool functionality) 
— Information gaps 
— Measurement gaps 
— Financial gaps 
— Facilities gaps (buildings, office space, etc.) 
• Data domain gaps: 
— Data not of sufficient currency 
— Data not located where it is needed 
— Not the data that is needed 
— Data not available when needed 
— Data not created 
— Data not consumed 
— Data relationship gaps 
• Applications impacted, eliminated, or created 
• Technologies impacted, eliminated, or created

104  Study Guide (2011) (Syllabus Reference: Unit 7, Learning Outcom e 8: You should be able to describe the gap 
analysis technique.) 
The steps are as follows: 
• Draw up a matrix with all the Architectur e Building Blocks (ABBs) of the Baseline 
Architecture on the vertical axis, and all the ABBs of the Target Architecture on the 
horizontal axis. 
• Add to the Baseline Architecture axis a final row labeled “New ABBs”, and to the Target 
Architecture axis a final column labeled “Eliminated ABBs”. 
• Where an ABB is available in both the Baseline and Target Architectures, record this with 
“Included” at the intersecting cell. 
• Where an ABB from the Baseline Architecture is  missing in the Target Architecture, each 
must be reviewed. If it was correctly eliminated, mark it as such in the appropriate 
“Eliminated” cell. If it was not, you have uncove red an accidental omission in your Target 
Architecture that must be addressed by reinstating the ABB in the next iteration of the architecture design – mark it as such in the appropriate “Eliminated” cell. 
• Where an ABB from the Target Architecture cannot be found in the Baseline Architecture, 
mark it at the intersection with the “New” ro w as a gap that needs to filled, either by 
developing or procuring the building block. 
When the exercise is complete, anything under “Eliminated Services” or “New Services” is a 
gap, which should either be explained as correctly  eliminated, or marked as to be addressed by 
reinstating or developing/ procuring the function. 
Table 11 shows examples of gaps between the Baseline Architecture and the Target 
Architecture; in this case the missing elemen ts are “broadcast services” and “shared screen 
services”.

8.6 Interoperability 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 7, Learning Outcome 9: You should be able to explain the term 
interoperability.) 
TOGAF defines interoperability as “the ability to  share information and services”. Defining the 
degree to which information and services are to be  shared is very important, especially in a 
complex organization and/or extended enterprise. 
Many organizations find it useful to categorize interoperability as follows: 
• Operational or Business Interoperability  defines how business processes are to be 
shared. 
• Information Interoperability  defines how information is to be shared. 
Personal PDF Edition 
© 2011 The Open Group, All Rights Reserved
Personal PDF Edition. Not for redistribution
 
106  Study Guide (2011) • Technical Interoperability  defines how technical services are to be shared or at least 
connect to one another. 
From an IT perspective, it is also useful to consider interoperability in a similar vein to 
Enterprise Application Integration (EAI); specifically: 
• Presentation Integration/Interoperability  is where a common look-and-feel approach 
through a common portal-like solution guides the user to the underlying functionality of the 
set of systems. 
• Information Integration/Interoperability  is where the corporate information is 
seamlessly shared between the various corporat e applications to achieve, for example, a 
common set of client information. Normally this is based upon a commonly accepted corporate ontology and shared services for the structure, quality, access, and security/privacy for the information. 
• Application Integration/Interoperability  is where the corporate functionality is integrated 
and shareable so that the applications are not duplicated (e.g., one change of address 
service/component; not one for every applica tion) and are seamlessly linked together 
through functionality such as workflow. Th is impacts the business and infrastructure 
applications and is very closely linked to corporate business process 
unification/interoperability. 
• Technical Integration/Interoperability  includes common methods and shared services for 
the communication, storage, processing, and acces s to data primarily in the application 
platform and communications infrastructure domains. This interoperability is premised upon the degree of rationalization of the corporate IT infrastructure, based upon standards and/or common IT platforms. For example, mu ltiple applications sharing one infrastructure 
or 10,000 corporate web sites using one centrali zed content management/web server (rather 
than thousands of servers and webmaster s spread throughout the country/globe). 
Example 2: Example Interoperability Model 
Example Interoperability Model 
An example interoperability model from the Canadian Government follows. This model includes a high-
level definition of three classes of in teroperability and the nature of the information and services shared at 
each level. Interoperability is coin ed in terms of e-enablers for e-Government. The interoperability 
breakdown is as follows: 
• Information interoperability: 
o Knowledge management 
o Business intelligence 
o Information management 
o Trusted identity 
• Business interoperability: 
o Delivery networks 
o e-Democracy 
o e-Business 
o Enterprise resource management 
o Relationship and case management 
• Technical interoperability: 
o IT infrastructure

TOGAF® 9 Foundation Study Guide, 2nd Edition  107 8.6.1 Interoperability and the ADM 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 7, Learning Outcome 10: You should understand where 
interoperability requirements are used within the ADM.) 
The determination of interopera bility occurs throughout the ADM: 
• In Phase A: Architecture Vision, the nature a nd security considerations of information and 
service exchanges are found using business scenarios. 
• In Phase B: Business Architecture, informa tion and service exchanges are defined in 
business terms. 
• In Phase C: Data Architecture, the content of  information exchanges is detailed using the 
corporate data and/or information exchange model. 
• In Phase C: Application Architecture, the ways that applications are to share information 
and services are specified. 
• In Phase D: Technology Architecture, appropriate technical mechanisms to permit 
information and service exchanges are specified. 
• In Phase E: Opportunities & Solutions, actual solutions are selected. 
• In Phase F: Migration Planning, intero perability is implemented logically. 
8.7 Business Transformati on Readiness Assessment 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 7, Learning Ou tcome 11: You should understand Business 
Transformation Readiness Assessment.) 
Enterprise architecture often involves considerab le change. Business Transformation Readiness 
Assessment provides a technique for understanding  the readiness of an organization to accept 
change, identifying the issues, and dealing with them in the Implementation and Migration Plan. 
It is based on the Canadian Government Business Transformation Enablement Program (BTEP). 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 7, Learning Outcom e 12: You should understand where the Business 
Transformation Readiness Assessment tec hnique is used within the ADM.) 
Use of such a technique is key to a successful architecture transformation in Phases E and F. An 
initial assessment of business transformation readiness is carried out in Phase A. 
This assessment is recommended to be a joint effo rt between corporate staff, lines of business, 
and IT planners. 
The recommended activities are: 
• Determine the readiness factors that will impact the organization 
• Present the readiness factors using maturity models 
• Assess the readiness factors, and determine the readiness factor ratings

108  Study Guide (2011) • Assess the risks for each readiness factor and id entify improvement actions to mitigate the 
risk 
• Document the findings into the Capability Assess ment and later incorporate the actions into 
the Implementation and Migration Plan in Phases E and F 
8.8 Risk Management 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 7, Learning Outcome 13:  You should understand the characteristics of 
Risk Management.) 
Risk management, documented in TOGAF 9 Part  III: ADM Guidelines and Techniques, Chapter 
31 (Risk Management), is a technique used to mitigate risk when implementing an architecture 
project. There are two levels of risk that should be considered: 
1. Initial Level of Risk: Risk categorizatio n prior to determining and implementing 
mitigating actions. 
2. Residual Level of Risk: Risk categorization after implementation of mitigating actions. 
The recommended process for managing risk consists of the following activities: 
• Risk classification 
• Risk identification 
• Initial risk assessment 
• Risk mitigation and residual risk assessment 
• Risk monitoring 
8.8.1 Risk Management in the ADM 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 7, Learning Ou tcome 14: You should understand where risk 
management is used within the TOGAF ADM.) 
Risk is pervasive in any enterprise architect ure activity and present in all phases within the 
ADM. Identification of business transformation risk s and mitigation activities is first determined 
in Phase A as part of the initial Business Tr ansformation Readiness Assessment. It is 
recommended that risk mitigation activities be in cluded within the Statement of Architecture 
Work. 
The risk identification and mitigation assessme nt worksheets are maintained as governance 
artifacts and are kept up-to-date in Phase G (Imple mentation Governance) where risk monitoring 
is conducted. 
Implementation governance can identify critical risks that are not being mitigated and might 
require another full or partial ADM cycle.

TOGAF® 9 Foundation Study Guide, 2nd Edition  109 8.9 Capability-Based Planning 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 7, Learning Outcom e 15: You should understand Capability-Based 
Planning.) 
Capability-Based Planning is a business planning technique that focuses on business outcomes. 
It is business-driven and business-led and combines  the requisite efforts of all lines of business 
to achieve the desired capability. It accommodat es most, if not all, of the corporate business 
models and is especially useful in organizations  where a latent capability to respond (e.g., an 
emergency preparedness unit) is required a nd the same resources are involved in multiple 
capabilities. Often the need fo r these capabilities is discovere d and refined using business 
scenarios. 
Figure 18 illustrates the relationship between Capa bility-Based Planning, enterprise architecture, 
and portfolio/project management.

TOGAF® 9 Foundation Study Guide, 2nd Edition  113 Chapter 9 Architecture Governance 
9.1 Key Learning Points 
This chapter will help you understand Architect ure Governance, and how it contributes to the 
Architecture Development Cycle. 
Key Points Explained 
This chapter will help you to answer the following questions: 
• What is Architecture Governance? 
• What are the main concepts that make up an Architecture Governance Framework? 
• Why is Architecture Governance beneficial? 
• What is the need to establish an Architecture Board? 
• What are the responsibilities of  an Architecture Board? 
• What is the role of Architecture Contracts? 
• What is Architecture Compliance? 
• How can the ADM be used to est ablish an Architecture Capability? 
 TOGAF provides significant guidance on establishi ng effective Architecture Governance and 
coordinating with other governance processes w ithin the organization. Effective governance 
ensures that problems are identified early and that subsequent changes to the environment 
occur in a controlled manner.

9.2 Introduction to Architecture Governance 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 8, Learning Outcome 1: You should be able to briefly explain the 
concept of Architecture Governance.) 
Architecture Governance is the practice by which enterprise architectures and other architectures 
are managed and controlled at an enterprise-wide level. 
Personal PDF Edition 
© 2011 The Open Group, All Rights Reserved
Personal PDF Edition. Not for redistribution
 
114  Study Guide (2011) Architecture Governance includes the following: 
• Implementing a system of controls over the creation and monitoring of all architectural 
components and activities, to ensure the e ffective introduction, implementation, and 
evolution of architectures within the organization 
• Implementing a system to ensure compliance with internal and external standards and 
regulatory obligations 
• Establishing processes that support effective management of the above processes within 
agreed parameters 
• Developing practices that ensure accountability to a clearly identified stakeholder 
community, both inside and outside the organization 
Architecture Governance typically operates within  a hierarchy of governance structures which, 
particularly in the larger enterprise, can include  the following as distinct domains with their own 
disciplines and processes: 
• Corporate Governance 
• Technology Governance  
• IT Governance 
• Architecture Governance 
Each of these domains of governance may exist at multiple geographic levels – global, regional, 
and local – within the overall enterprise. Corpor ate Governance is a broad topic and outside the 
scope of the TOGAF framework.

TOGAF® 9 Foundation Study Guide, 2nd Edition  115  What is Governance? 
Governance is about ensuring that business is c onducted properly. It is less about overt control 
and strict adherence to rules, and more a bout effective usage of resources to ensure 
sustainability of an organization's strategic objectives. 
The following characteristics, adapted from Corporate Governance  (Naidoo, 2002), are used 
in TOGAF to highlight both the value and n ecessity for governance as an approach to be 
adopted within organizations and their dealings with all involved parties: 
Discipline: All involved parties will have a commitment to adhere to procedures, processes, 
and authority structures established by the organization. 
Transparency: All actions implemented and their d ecision support will be available for 
inspection by authorized organization and provider parties. 
Independence: All processes, decision-making, and mech anisms used will be established so 
as to minimize or avoid potential conflicts of interest. 
Accountability: Identifiable groups within the organization – e.g., governance boards who 
take actions or make decisions – are au thorized and accountable for their actions. 
Responsibility: Each contracted party is required to act  responsibly to the organization and its 
stakeholders. 
Fairness: All decisions taken, processes used, and thei r implementation will not be allowed to 
create unfair advantage to any one particular party. 
9.3 TOGAF Architecture Governance Framework 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 8, Learning Outcome 2: You should be able to describe the main 
concepts that make up an Architecture Governance Framework.) 
Phase G of the TOGAF ADM is dedicated to Implementation Governance, which concerns itself 
with the realization of the architecture through change projects. Architecture Governance covers 
the management and control of all aspects of the development and evolution of architectures. It 
needs to be supported by an Architecture Govern ance Framework which assists in identifying 
effective processes so that the business responsib ilities associated with Ar chitecture Governance 
can be elucidated, communicated, and managed e ffectively. TOGAF provides such a framework, 
which is described in the following sections. 
9.3.1 Conceptual Structure 
Architecture Governance is an approach, a series of  processes, a cultural orientation, and set of 
owned responsibilities that ensure the integr ity and effectiveness of the organization's 
architectures. The key concepts are shown in Figure 19.

Personal PDF Edition. Not for redistribution
 
116  Study Guide (2011) 
 
Figure 19: Architecture Governance Fr amework – Conceptual Structure 
The split of process, content, and context is  key to supporting an Architecture Governance 
initiative. It allows the introduction of new g overnance material (for example, due to new 
regulations) without unduly impacting the pro cesses. The content-agnostic approach ensures the 
framework is flexible. 
Key Architecture Governance Processes 
The following are the key processes: 
1. Policy Management and Take-On 
2. Compliance 
3. Dispensation 
4. Monitoring and Reporting 
5. Business Control 
6. Environment Management 
9.3.2 Organizational Structure 
Governance is the practice of ma naging and controlling architectures. An effective Architecture 
Governance structure requires pr ocesses, structures, and capabilities (see Figure 20) and will 
typically include a global governance board, local governance board, design authorities, and working parties.

9.4 The Benefits of Architecture Governance 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 8, Learning Outc ome 3: You should be able to explain why 
Architecture Governance is beneficial.) 
Architecture Governance is beneficial because it: 
• Links IT processes, resources, and informa tion to organizational strategies and objectives 
• Integrates and institutionalizes IT best practices 
• Aligns with industry frameworks such as COBIT (planning and organizing, acquiring and 
implementing, delivering and supporting, and monitoring IT performance) 
• Enables the organization to take full advantag e of its information, infrastructure, and 
hardware/software assets 
• Protects the underlying digital assets of the organization 
• Supports regulatory and best practice re quirements such as auditability, security, 
responsibility, and accountability

 What are the Key Success Factors when  establishing Architecture Governance? 
It is important to consider the following to ensure a successful approach to Architecture 
Governance, and effective management of the Architecture Contract: 
• Establishment and operation of best practices for submission, adoption, re-use, reporting, and 
retirement of architecture policies, procedures, ro les, skills, organizational structures, and support 
services 
• Establishment of correct organizational responsibilities and structures to support Architecture 
Governance processes and reporting requirements 
• Integration of tools and processes to facilitate ta ke-up of processes (both procedural and cultural) 
• Management of criteria for control of Architecture Governance processes, dispensations, 
compliance assessments, Service Level Agreements  (SLAs), and Operational Level Agreements 
(OLAs) 
• Meeting internal and external requirements for ef fectiveness, efficiency, confidentiality, integrity, 
availability, compliance, and reliability of Archit ecture Governance-related information, services, 
and processes 
9.5 Architecture Board 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 8, Learning Outcome 4: You should be able to briefly explain the need 
for establishment of an Architecture Board.) 
An enterprise architecture imposed without appr opriate political backing is bound to fail. An 
important element in any Architecture Govern ance strategy is establishment of a cross-
organizational Architecture Board to oversee the implementation of the governance strategy. This body should be representative of all the key stakeholders in the architecture, and will 
typically comprise a group of executives responsib le for the review and maintenance of the 
overall architecture. 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 8, Learning Outcome 5:  You should be able to list the responsibilities 
of an Architecture Board.) 
The Architecture Board is typically made respons ible, and accountable, for achieving some or all 
of the following goals: 
• Providing the basis for all decision-making w ith regard to changes to the architectures 
• Consistency between sub-architectures 
• Establishing targets for re-use of components 
• Flexibility of enterprise architecture; to m eet business needs and utilize new technologies 
• Enforcement of Architecture Compliance 
• Improving the maturity level of architecture discipline within the organization 
• Ensuring that the discipline of archit ecture-based development is adopted 
• Supporting a visible escalation capability for out-of-bounds decisions

TOGAF® 9 Foundation Study Guide, 2nd Edition  119 The Architecture Board is also responsible fo r operational items such as the monitoring and 
control of Architecture Contracts, and fo r governance items such as producing usable 
governance materials. 
9.6 Architecture Contracts 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 8, Learning Outcome 6: You should be able to briefly explain the role 
of Architecture Contracts.) 
Architecture Contracts are joint agreements be tween development partners and sponsors on the 
deliverables, quality, and fitness-for-purpose of an architecture. Successful implementation of 
these agreements will be delivered through effective Architecture Governance. Taking a 
governed approach to contract management en sures a system that continuously monitors 
integrity, changes, decision-making, and audit, as well as adherence to the principles, standards, 
and requirements of the enterprise. The architect ure team may also be included in product 
procurement, to help minimize the opportunity  for misinterpretation of the enterprise 
architecture. 
9.7 Architecture Compliance 
9.7.1 The Meaning of Architecture Compliance 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 8, Learning Outcome 7: You should be able to briefly explain the 
meaning of Architecture Compliance.) 
TOGAF defines the meaning of key terms such as “conformant”, “compliant”, etc. as shown in

9.7.2 The Need for Architecture Compliance 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 8, Learning Outcome 8: You should be able to briefly explain the need 
for Architecture Compliance.) 
Ensuring the compliance of individual projects w ithin the enterprise arch itecture is an essential 
aspect of Architecture Governance. An Architect ure Compliance strategy should be adopted. 
TOGAF recommends two complementary processes: 
• The Architecture function will be required to pr epare a series of Project Architectures; i.e., 
project-specific views of the enterprise arch itecture that illustrate how the enterprise 
architecture impacts on the major projects w ithin the organization. (See ADM Phases A to 
F.) 
• The IT Governance function will define a formal Architecture Compliance Review process 
(see below) for reviewing the compliance of  projects to the enterprise architecture. 
Apart from defining formal processes, the Archit ecture Governance function may also stipulate 
that the architecture function should extend beyo nd the role of architecture definition and

TOGAF® 9 Foundation Study Guide, 2nd Edition  121 standards selection, and participate also in th e technology selection process, and even in the 
commercial relationships involved in external service provision and product purchases. This may 
help to minimize the opportunity for misinter pretation of the enterprise architecture, and 
maximize the value of centralized commercial negotiation. 
9.7.3 The Purpose of Architecture Compliance Reviews 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 8, Learning Outcome 9: You should be able to briefly explain the 
purpose of Architecture Compliance Reviews.) 
The purpose of an Architecture Complia nce Review includes the following: 
• To catch errors in the project architecture ear ly, and thereby reduce the cost and risk of 
changes required later in the lifecycle; this in turn means that the overall project time is 
shortened, and that the business gets the botto m-line benefit of the architecture development 
faster 
• To ensure the application of b est practices to architecture work 
• To provide an overview of the compliance of an architecture to mandated enterprise 
standards 
• To identify where the standards themselves may require modification 
• To identify services that are cu rrently application-specific but might be provided as part of 
the enterprise infrastructure 
• To document strategies for collaboration, r esource sharing, and other synergies across 
multiple architecture teams 
• To take advantage of advances in technology 
• To communicate to management the status of technical readiness of the project 
• To identify key criteria for procurement activ ities (e.g., for inclusion in Commercial Off-
The-Shelf (COTS) product RFI/RFP documents) 
• To identify and communicate significant architectural gaps to product and service providers 
The Architecture Compliance Review can also be  a good way of deciding between architectural 
alternatives, since the business decision-makers typically involved in the review can guide 
decisions in terms of what is best for the business, as opposed to what  is technically more 
pleasing or elegant. 
9.7.4 The Architecture Compliance Review Process 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 8, Learning Outcome 10:  You should be able to briefly describe the 
Architecture Compliance Review process.) 
An Architecture Compliance Review is a scrutiny of the compliance of a specific project against 
established architectural criteria, spirit, and business objectives. TOGAF  describes a process, 
including the roles and actions to undertake a review and deliver an assessment report, as 
summarized in Figure 22.

9.8 Using the ADM to Establish an Architecture Capability 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 8, Learning Outcome 11:  You should be able to briefly explain how 
the ADM can be used to establish an Architecture Capability.) 
Establishing a sustainable Architecture Capability  within an organization can be achieved by 
adhering to the same approach th at is used to establish any ot her capability – such as a business 
process management capability – within an organi zation. The ADM is an ideal method to be 
used to architect and govern the implementati on of such a capability. Applying the ADM with 
the specific Architecture Vision to establish an architecture practice within the organization 
would achieve this objective. 
TOGAF states that this should not be seen as a phase of an architecture project, or a one-off 
project, but rather as an ongoing practice that provides the context, environment, and resources 
to govern and enable architecture delivery to the organization. As an architecture project is executed within this environment it might requ est a change to the architecture practice that 
would trigger another cycle of the ADM to extend the architecture practice. 
Implementing any capability within an organization would require the design of the four domain 
architectures: Business, Data, Application, and Technology. Estab lishing the architecture 
practice within an organization would therefore require the design of: 
• The Business Architecture of the architecture practice that will highlight the Architecture 
Governance, architecture processes, architect ure organizational structure, architecture 
information requirements, architecture products, etc.

124  Study Guide (2011) • The Data Architecture that would define th e structure of the organization's Enterprise 
Continuum and Architecture Repository 
• The Application Architecture specifying the functionality and/or applications services 
required to enable the architecture practice 
• The Technology Architecture that depicts the architecture practice's infrastructure 
requirements and deployment in support of the architecture applications and Enterprise 
Continuum 
9.9 Summary 
Architecture Governance is the practice and orie ntation by which enterprise architectures and 
other architectures are managed and controlled at  an enterprise-wide level. It includes the 
following: 
• Implementing a system of controls over the creation and monitoring of all architecture 
components and activities, to ensure the e ffective introduction, implementation, and 
evolution of architectures within the organization 
• Implementing a system to ensure compliance with internal and external standards and 
regulatory obligations 
• Establishing processes that support effective management of the above processes within 
agreed parameters 
• Developing practices that ensure accountability to a clearly identified stakeholder 
community, both inside and outside the organization 
An important element in any Architecture Gove rnance strategy is establishment of a cross-
organizational Architecture Board to oversee the implementation of the governance strategy. This body should be representative of all the key stakeholders in the architecture, and will 
typically comprise a group of executives responsib le for the review and maintenance of the 
overall architecture. 
Architecture Contracts are joint agreements be tween development partners and sponsors on the 
deliverables, quality, and fitness-for-purpose of an architecture. Successful implementation of 
these agreements will be delivered thro ugh effective Architecture Governance. 
Ensuring the compliance of individual projects w ithin the enterprise arch itecture is an essential 
aspect of Architecture Governance. An Architecture Compliance strategy should be adopted.

128  Study Guide (2011) Chapter 10 Views, Viewpoints, and 
Stakeholders 
10.1 Key Learning Points 
This chapter will help you understand the concepts  of views and viewpoints, and their role in 
communicating with stakeholders. 
Key Points Explained 
This chapter will help you to answer the following questions: 
• What are the key concepts for views and viewpoints in TOGAF? 
• How can a simple example of a viewpoint and view be described? 
• What are the relationships between stake holders, concerns, views, and viewpoints? 
• How are views created? 
10.2 Concepts and Definitions 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 9, Learning Outcome 1:  You should be able to define and explain the 
following concepts: stakeholders,  concerns, views and viewpoints.)  
In this section we introduce the fo llowing concepts and definitions: 
• System 
• Stakeholders 
• Concerns 
• Views 
• Viewpoints 
These have been adapted from more formal defi nitions in ISO/IEC 42010:2007. Many people 
use these terms in different ways. Here we need  to understand them within the context of 
TOGAF 9.

TOGAF® 9 Foundation Study Guide, 2nd Edition  129 10.2.1 System 
A system  is a collection of components organized to accomplish a specific function or set of 
functions. 
“The term system  encompasses individual applications , systems in the traditional sense, 
subsystems, systems of systems, product lines, product families, whole enterprises, and other 
aggregations of interest.” 
[Source: ISO/IEC 42010:2007, previous ly known as IEEE Std 1471-2000] 
10.2.2 Stakeholders 
Stakeholders  are people who have key roles in, or concerns  about, the system; for example, 
users, developers, etc. Stakeholders can be individuals, teams, organizations, etc. 
A system has one or more stakeholders. Each stak eholder typically has interests in, or concerns 
relative to, that system. Figure 23 shows a typi cal set of stakeholders for an enterprise 
architecture, with defined categories of stakeholder type. 
 
Figure 23: A Typical Set of Stakehold ers for an Enterprise Architecture 
10.2.3 Concerns 
Concerns  are key interests that are crucially impo rtant to stakeholders, and determine the 
acceptability of the system.

130  Study Guide (2011) They may include performance, reliability, security , distribution, evolvab ility, etc. A Security 
Architect could have the following concerns: auth entication, authorization, audit, assurance, 
availability, asset protection, administration, risk management. 
 The terms “concern” and “requirement” are not synonymous. A concern is an area of interest. 
Concerns are the root of the process of d ecomposition into requirements. Concerns are 
represented in the architecture by these requirements. Requirements should be SMART (i.e., 
should include specific metrics). 
[Source: TOGAF 9 Part VI: Architecture Content Framework, Chapter 35 (Architectural 
Artifacts)] 
10.2.4 View 
A view is a representation of a system from the perspective of a related set of concerns. A view 
is what you see (or what a stakeholder sees). 
An architect creates architecture models. A view consists of parts of these, chosen to show 
stakeholders that their concerns are being met.  For example, just as a building architect will 
create wiring diagrams, floor plans, and elevations to describe different facets of a building to its 
different stakeholders (electricians, owners, pla nning officials), so an Enterprise Architect must 
create different views of the business, information system, and technical architecture for the stakeholders who have concerns  related to these aspects. Th ese might include business process, 
physical layout, and security views of an IT system. 
 
Figure 24: Typical Views from Building Architecture 
10.2.5 Viewpoint 
A viewpoint  defines the perspective from which a view is taken. 
It defines how to construct and use a view, th e information needed, the modeling techniques for 
expressing and analyzing it, and a rationale for these choices (e.g ., by describing the purpose and 
intended audience of the view). 
The relationship between viewpoint and view is an alogous to that of a template and an instance 
of the completed template. In constructing an ente rprise architecture, an architect first selects the 
viewpoints (templates), then constructs  a set of corresponding views (instances).

TOGAF® 9 Foundation Study Guide, 2nd Edition  131 10.3 Architecture Views and Viewpoints 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 9, Learning Outcome 2: You should be able to describe a simple 
example of a viewpoint and view.)  
The architect uses views and viewpoints in the ADM cycle during Phases A through D for 
developing architectures for each domain (Bus iness, Data, Application, and Technology). 
 Views and Viewpoints 
A “view” is what you see. A “viewpoint” is wh ere you are looking from; the vantage point or 
perspective that determines what you see (a vi ewpoint can also be thought of as a schema). 
Viewpoints are generic, and can be stored in libraries for re-use. 
A view is always specific to the architecture for which it is created. 
Every view has an associated viewpoint th at describes it, at least implicitly. 
To illustrate the concepts of views and viewpoints,  consider Example 3. This is a very simple 
airport system with two different stakeholde rs: the pilot and the air traffic controller. 
Example 3: Views and Viewpoints for a Simple Airport System 
Views and Viewpoints for a Simple Airport System 
The pilot has one view of the system , and the air traffic controller has another. Neither view represents 
the whole system, because the persp ective of each stakeholder constrains (and reduces) how each sees the 
overall system. 
The view of the pilot comprises some elements not view ed by the controller, such as passengers and fuel, 
while the view of the controller comprises some elements not viewed by the pilot, such as other planes. There are also elements shared be tween the views, such as the co mmunication model between the pilot 
and the controller, and the vital information about the plane itself. 
A viewpoint is a model (or description) of the information contained in a view. In this example, one 
viewpoint is the description of how the pilot sees the system, and the other viewpoint is how the controller sees the system. Pilots describe the syst em from their perspective, using a model of their 
position and vector toward or away from the runway . All pilots use this model, and the model has a 
specific language that is used to capture information and populate the model. Controllers describe the 
system differently, using a model of the airspace and the locations and vectors of aircraft within the 
airspace. Again, all controllers use a common la nguage derived from the common model in order to 
capture and communicate information pertinent to their viewpoint. 
Fortunately, when controllers talk with pilots, they use a common communication language. (In other 
words, the models representing their individual view points partially intersect.) Part of this common 
language is about location and vector s of aircraft, and is essential to safety. So in essence each viewpoint 
is an abstract model of how all the stakeholders of a particular type – all pilots, or all controllers – view 
the airport system. The interface to the human user of a tool is typically close to the model and language associated with the viewpoint. The unique tools of the pilot are fuel, altitude, speed, and location 
indicators. The main tool of the controller is radar. The common tool is a radio. 
To summarize from Example 3, we can see that a view can subset the system through the 
perspective of the stake holder, such as the pilot versus  the controller. This subset can be 
described by an abstract model called a viewpoint, such as an air flight versus  an air space 
model. This description of the view is documente d in a partially specialized language, such as 
Personal PDF Edition

Personal PDF Edition. Not for redistribution
 
132  Study Guide (2011) “pilot-speak” versus  “controller-speak”. Tools are used to  assist the stakeholders, and they 
interface with each other in terms of the language derived from the viewpoint. When stakeholders use common tools, such as the ra dio contact between pilot and controller, a 
common language is essential. 
For many architectures, a useful viewpoint is that of business domains, which can be illustrated 
by an example from The Open Group. 
The viewpoint can be specified as follows: 
Viewpoint Element Description 
Stakeholders Management B oard, Chief Executive Officer 
Concerns Show the top-level relationships between geographical sites and business 
functions. 
Modeling technique Nested boxes diagram. 
Outer boxes = locations; inner boxes = business functions. 
Semantics of nesting = functions performed in the locations. 
The corresponding view of The Open Group (in 2008) is shown in Figure 25.

134  Study Guide (2011) The architect chooses and develops a set of vi ews in the ADM cycle during Phases A through D 
that enable the architecture to be communicated to, and understood by, all the stakeholders, and 
enable them to verify that the system will address their concerns. 
The choice of which particular architecture views to  develop is one of the key decisions that the 
architect has to make. 
The architect has a responsibility for ensuring: 
• The completeness of the architecture: 
— Does it address all the concerns of its stakeholders? 
• The integrity of the architecture: 
— Can the views be connected to each other? 
— Can the conflicting con cerns be reconciled? 
— What trade-offs have been made (e .g., between security and performance)? 
Recommended Steps 
The following are the recommended steps to create the required views for a particular 
architecture: 
1. Refer to any existing libraries of viewpoints (note that TOGAF 9 includes a set of 
architecture viewpoints). 
2. Select key stakeholders. 
3. Analyze their concerns and document them. 
4. Select appropriate viewpoints (based on th e stakeholders and their concerns). 
5. Generate views of the system using the selected viewpoints as templates. 
10.6 Summary 
TOGAF embraces the concepts and definitions of  ISO/IEC 42010:2007, specifically those that 
guide the development of a view, and make the view actionable, such as: 
• Selecting key stakeholders 
• Analyzing their concerns and documenting them 
• Understanding how to model and deal with those concerns 
The language used to depict the view is th e viewpoint. The viewpoints provided should be 
customized to create a set of architecture views that ensure all stakeholder concerns are met.

11.1 Key Learning Points 
This chapter will help you understand the c oncept of building blocks within TOGAF. 
Key Points Explained 
This chapter will help you to answer the following questions: 
• What is a building block? 
• What is the difference between an Archit ecture Building Block and a Solution Building 
Block? 
• How are building blocks used within the ADM cycle? 
• What are the characteristics of an architecture pattern? 
11.2 What is a Building Block? 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 10, Learning Outcome 1: You should be able to define what a building 
block is, and explain what makes a good building block.)  
A building block is a package of functionalit y defined to meet business needs across an 
organization. A building block has published inte rfaces to access functionality. A building block 
may interoperate with other, possi bly inter-dependent building blocks. 
A good building block has the following characteristics: 
• It considers implementation and usage, and e volves to exploit technology and standards. 
• It may be assembled from other building blocks. 
• It may be a subassembly of other building blocks. 
• Ideally, a building block is re-usable and replaceable, and well specified with stable 
interfaces. 
• Its specification should be loosely coupled to its  implementation, so that it can be realized 
in several ways without impacting the building block specification. 
The way in which functionality, products, and cust om developments are a ssembled into building 
blocks varies widely between individual architect ures. Every organization must decide for itself 
what arrangement of building blocks works best  for it. A good choice of building blocks can

TOGAF® 9 Foundation Study Guide, 2nd Edition  137 lead to improvements in legacy system integr ation, interoperability, and flexibility in the 
creation of new systems and applications. 
An architecture is a composition of: 
• A set of building blocks depicted in an architectural model 
• A specification of how those building blocks are connected to meet the overall requirements 
of an information system 
The various building blocks in an architectur e specify the services required in an enterprise-
specific system. 
The following general principles should apply: 
• An architecture need only contain building bloc ks to implement those services it requires. 
• Building blocks may implement one, more than one, or only part of a service identified in 
the architecture. 
• Building blocks should conform to standards. 
11.3 Architecture Building Blo cks and Solution Building Blocks 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 10, Learning Outcome 2: You should be able to explain the distinction 
between Architecture Building Blo cks and Solution Building Blocks.) 
Systems are built from collections of buildings bloc ks. They can be defined at many levels of 
detail: 
• Groupings at a functional level, such as a customer database, are known as Architecture 
Building Blocks. 
• Real products or specific custom developmen ts are known as Solutions Building Blocks. 
11.3.1 Architecture Building Blocks 
Architecture Building Blocks (ABBs) are architecture documentation and models from the 
enterprise’s Architecture Repository classified ac cording to the Architect ure Continuum. They 
are defined or selected during application of the ADM – mainly in Phases A, B, C, and D. 
The characteristics of ABBs are as follows: 
• They define what functionality will be implemented. 
• They capture architecture requirements; e.g., Business, Data, Application, and Technology 
requirements. 
• They direct and guide the development of Solution Building Blocks.

138  Study Guide (2011) ABB specifications should contain as a minimum: 
• Fundamental functionality and attributes: semantic, unambiguous, including security 
capability and manageability 
• Interfaces: chosen set, supplied 
• Interoperability and relationshi p to other building blocks 
• Dependent building blocks with required functionality and named user interfaces 
• Map to business/organizational entities and policies 
Each ABB should include a statement of any architecture documentation and models from the 
enterprise's Architecture Repository that can be  re-used in the architecture development. The 
specification of building blocks using the ADM  is an evolutionary and iterative process. 
11.3.2 Solution Building Blocks 
Solution Building Blocks (SBBs) relate to the Solutions Continuum. They are implementations 
of the architectures identified in the enterpri se’s Architecture Continuum and may be either 
procured or developed. SBBs appear in Ph ase E of the ADM where product-specific building 
blocks are considered for the first time. S BBs define what products and components will 
implement the functionality, thereby defining the implementation. 
The characteristics of SBBs are as follows: 
• They define what products and compone nts will implement the functionality. 
• They define the implementation. 
• They fulfill business requirements. 
• They are product or vendor-aware. 
SBB specifications should contain as a minimum: 
• Specific functionality and attributes 
• Interfaces: the implemented set 
• Required SBBs used with required func tionality and names of interfaces used 
• Mapping from the SBBs to the IT topology and operational policies 
• Specifications of attributes shared su ch as security, manageability, scalability 
• Performance, configurability 
• Design drivers and constraints including physical architecture 
• Relationships between the SBBs and ABBs

TOGAF® 9 Foundation Study Guide, 2nd Edition  139 11.4 Building Blocks and the ADM 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 10, Learning Outcome 3:  You should be able to briefly explain the use 
of building blocks in the ADM cycle.)  
Systems are built up from collections of building blocks, so most building blocks have to 
interoperate with other building blocks. Wherever that is true, it is important that the interfaces 
to a building block are published and reasonably stable. 
Building blocks can be defined at various le vels of detail, depending on what stage of 
architecture development has been reached. 
For instance, at an early stage, a building block can simply consist of a grouping of functionality, 
such as a customer database and some retrieval tool s. Building blocks at this functional level of 
definition are described in TOGAF as Architect ure Building Blocks (ABBs). Later on, real 
products or custom developments  replace these simple definiti ons of functionality, and the 
building blocks are then described as Solution Building Blocks (SBBs). 
The key phases and steps of the ADM at which building blocks are evolved and specified are 
summarized as follows, and illustrated in Figure 27.

140  Study Guide (2011) In Phase A, the earliest building block definitions  start as relatively abstract entities within the 
Architecture Vision. 
In Phases B, C, and D building blocks within th e Business, Data, Application, and Technology 
Architectures are evolved to a common pattern of steps. 
Finally, in Phase E the building blocks beco me more implementation-specific as SBBs are 
identified to address gaps. 
11.5 Architecture Patterns 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 10, Learning Outcom e 4: You should be able to describe the 
characteristics of an architecture pattern.)  
 Pattern 
A pattern is “an idea that has been useful in one practical context and will probably be useful 
in others”. 
[Source: Analysis Patterns – Re-usable Object Models] 
In TOGAF, patterns are considered to be a wa y of putting building blocks into context; for 
example, to describe a re-usable solution to a problem. Building blocks are what you use; 
patterns can tell you how you use them, when, why, and what trade-offs you have to make in doing that. 
Patterns offer the promise of he lping the architect to identify combinations of Architecture 
and/or Solution Building Blocks (ABBs/SBBs) th at have been proven to deliver effective 
solutions in the past, and may provide the b asis for effective solu tions in the future. 
11.6 Summary 
A building block has the following characteristics: 
• It is a package of functionality defined to meet the business needs across an organization 
• It has published interfaces to access functionality 
• It may interoperate with other,  inter-dependent building blocks 
A good building block: 
• Considers implementation and usage and evolves to exploit technology 
• May be assembled from other building blocks 
• Is re-usable

142  Study Guide (2011) Chapter 12 ADM Deliverables 
12.1 Key Learning Points 
This chapter will help you understa nd the key terminology of TOGAF. 
Key Points Explained 
This chapter will help you to answer the following questions: 
• What is the role of architectur e deliverables across the ADM cycle? 
• What is the purpose of key deliverables? 
12.2 The Role of Architecture Deliverables 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 11, Learning Outcome 1:  You should be able to briefly explain the 
role of architecture deliver ables across the ADM cycle.) 
TOGAF defines a set of suggested deliverables th at will be consumed and produced across the 
TOGAF ADM cycle The deliverable set provided is  intended to provide a typical baseline of 
architecture deliverables in order to better define  the activities required in the ADM and act as a 
starting point for tailoring within a specific organization. 
TOGAF identifies deliverables that are produ ced as outputs from executing the ADM cycle and 
potentially consumed as inputs at other points in the ADM. Other deliverables may be produced elsewhere and consumed by the ADM. 
 As deliverables are typically the contractual or fo rmal work products of an architecture project, 
it is likely that these deliverables will be constr ained or altered by any overarching project or 
process management for the enterprise (such as CMMI, PRINCE2, PMBOK, or MSP).

TOGAF® 9 Foundation Study Guide, 2nd Edition  143 12.3.1 Architecture Bu ilding Blocks (ABBs) 
ABBs are architecture documentation and models from the enterprise's Architecture Repository. 
See Chapter 11. 
12.3.2 Architecture Contract 
Architecture Contracts are the joint agreements  between development partners and sponsors on 
the deliverables, quality, and fitness-for-purpose of  an architecture. They are produced in Phase 
G: Architecture Governance. Successful implemen tation of these agreements will be delivered 
through effective Architecture Governance. 
By implementing a governed approach to the mana gement of contracts, the following will be 
ensured: 
• A system of continuous monitoring to check integrity, changes, decision-making, and audit 
of all architecture-related ac tivities within the organization 
• Adherence to the principles, standards, and requirements of the existing or developing 
architectures 
• Identification of risks in all aspects of the development and implementation of the 
architecture(s) covering the internal devel opment against accepted standards, policies, 
technologies, and products as well as the operational aspects of the architectures such that 
the organization can continue its bus iness within a resilient environment 
• A set of processes and practices that ensure  accountability, responsibility, and discipline 
with regard to the development and usage of all architectural artifacts 
• A formal understanding of the governance organi zation responsible for the contract, their 
level of authority, and scope of the architecture under the governance of this body 
12.3.3 Architecture Definition Document 
The Architecture Definition Document is the deliv erable container for the core architectural 
artifacts created during a project and for important related information. The Architecture 
Definition Document spans all architecture do mains (Business, Data, Application, and 
Technology) and also examines all relevant states  of the architecture (baseline, transition, and 
target). 
It is first created in Phase A, where it is pop ulated with artifacts created to support the 
Architecture Vision. It is updated in Phase B, with Business Architecture-related material, and 
subsequently updated with Information Systems Ar chitecture material in Phase C, and then with 
Technology Architecture material in Phase D. Wh ere the scope of change to implement the 
Target Architecture requires an incremental a pproach, the Architecture Definition Document 
will be updated to include one or more Transition Architectures in Phase E. 
A Transition Architecture shows the enterprise at an  architecturally significant state between the 
Baseline and Target Architectures. Transition Ar chitectures are used to describe transitional 
Target Architectures necessary for effective realization of the Target Architecture.

144  Study Guide (2011)  Architecture Definition Document versus Architecture Requirements Specification 
The Architecture Definition Document is a companion to the Architecture Requirements 
Specification, with a complementary objective: 
The Architecture Definition Document provides a qu alitative view of the solution and aims to 
communicate the intent of the architects. 
The Architecture Requirements Specification pr ovides a quantitative view of the solution, 
stating measurable criteria that must be met during the implementation of the architecture. 
12.3.4 Architecture Principles 
This set of documentation is an initial output of  the Preliminary Phase. Principles are general 
rules and guidelines, intended to be enduring an d seldom amended, that inform and support the 
way in which an organization sets about fulfilling its mission. 
In their turn, principles may be just one element in a structured set of ideas that collectively 
define and guide the organization, fro m values through actions to results. 
See Section 8.3. 
12.3.5 Architecture Repository 
The Architecture Repository acts as a holding area fo r all architecture-related projects within the 
enterprise. The repository allows projects to mana ge their deliverables, locate re-usable assets, 
and publish outputs to stakeholders  and other interested parties. 
See Sections 3.5 and 6.8. 
12.3.6 Architecture Requi rements Specification 
The Architecture Requirements Specification provi des a set of quantitative statements that 
outline what an implementation project must do in  order to comply with the architecture. An 
Architecture Requirements Specification will typically form a major component of an implementation contract or a contract fo r more detailed Architecture Definition. 
12.3.7 Architecture Roadmap 
The Architecture Roadmap lists individual wo rk packages that will realize the Target 
Architecture and lays them out on a timeline to show progression from the Baseline Architecture 
to the Target Architecture. The Architecture Roadmap highlights individual work packages’ 
business value at each stage. Transition Architectur es necessary to effectiv ely realize the Target 
Architecture are identified as intermediate step s. The Architecture Roadmap is incrementally 
developed throughout Phases E and F, and inform ed by the roadmap components developed in 
Phases B, C, and D. 
12.3.8 Architecture Vision 
The Architecture Vision is created in Phase A a nd provides a high-level summary of the changes 
to the enterprise that will fo llow from successful deployment of  the Target Architecture. The 
Personal PDF Edition

TOGAF® 9 Foundation Study Guide, 2nd Edition  145 purpose of the vision is to agree at the outset  what the desired outcome should be for the 
architecture, so that architects can then fo cus on the detail necessary to validate feasibility. 
Providing an Architecture Vision also supports  stakeholder communication by providing a 
summary version of the full Architecture Definition. 
 Business scenarios (see Section 8.4) are a recomme nded technique that can be used as part of 
developing an Architecture Vision document. 
12.3.9 Business Principles, Busin ess Goals, and Business Drivers 
Business principles, business goals, and business dr ivers provide context for architecture work, 
by describing the needs and ways of working employed by the enterprise. These will have 
usually been defined elsewhere in the enterprise prior to the architecture activity. Many factors 
that lie outside the consideration of architectur e discipline may have significant implications for 
the way that architecture is developed. 
12.3.10 Capability Assessment 
Before embarking upon a detailed Architecture De finition, it is valuable to understand the 
baseline and target capability level of the enterpri se. This assessment is first carried out in Phase 
A and updated in Phase E. 
This Capability Assessment can be  examined on several levels: 
• What is the capability level of the enterprise as a whole? Where does th e enterprise wish to 
increase or optimize capability? What are the ar chitectural focus areas that will support the 
desired development of the enterprise? 
• What is the capability or maturity level of th e IT function within the enterprise? What are 
the likely implications of conducting the architecture project in terms of design governance, operational governance, skills, and organization st ructure? What is an appropriate style, 
level of formality, and amount of detail for the architecture project to fit with the culture 
and capability of the IT organization? 
• What is the capability and maturity of the arch itecture function within the enterprise? What 
architectural assets are currently in existen ce? Are they maintained and accurate? What 
standards and reference models need to be c onsidered? Are there likely to be opportunities 
to create re-usable assets during the architecture project? 
• Where capability gaps exist, to what extent is the business ready to transform in order to 
reach the target capability? What are the risks to transformation, cultural barriers, and other 
considerations to be addressed beyond the basic capability gap? 
12.3.11 Change Request 
Requests for Architecture Change  are considered in Phase H. 
During implementation of an architecture, as more  facts become known, it is possible that the 
original Architecture Definition and requirement s are not suitable or are not sufficient to 
Personal PDF Edition

Personal PDF Edition. Not for redistribution
 
146  Study Guide (2011) complete the implementation of a solution.  In these circumstances, it is necessary for 
implementation projects to either deviate from the suggested architectural approach or to request 
scope extensions. Additionally, external factors – such as market factors, changes in business 
strategy, and new technology opportunities – may open up opportunities to extend and refine the 
architecture. 
In these circumstances, a Change Request may be submitted in order to request a dispensation or 
to kick-start a further cycle of architecture work. 
12.3.12 Communications Plan 
Enterprise architectures contain large volumes of complex and inter-dependent information. 
Effective communication of targeted information to  the right stakeholders at the right time is a 
critical success factor for enterprise architectur e. Development of a Communications Plan in 
Phase A for the architecture allows for this comm unication to be carried out within a planned 
and managed process. 
12.3.13 Compliance Assessment 
Once an architecture has been defined, it is necessary to govern that architecture through 
implementation to ensure that the original Archit ecture Vision is appropriately realized and that 
any implementation learnings are fed back into  the architecture process. Periodic compliance 
reviews of implementation projects in Phase G provide a mechanism to review project progress and ensure that the design and implementation is proceeding in-line with the strategic and 
architectural objectives. 
See Section 9.7. 
12.3.14 Implementation and Migration Plan 
The Implementation and Migration Plan provides a schedule of the projects for implementation 
of Target Architecture. The Implementation and Migration Plan includes executable projects 
grouped into managed portfolios and programs. The Implementation and Migration Strategy 
identifying the approach to change is a key el ement of the Implementation and Migration Plan. 
 Development of the Implementation and Migration Plan 
The outline Implementation and Migration Plan is  created in Phase E and then finalized in 
Phase F. 
12.3.15 Implementation Governance Model 
Once an architecture has been defined, it is ne cessary to plan how the Transition Architecture 
that implements the architecture will be governed  through implementation. Within organizations 
that have established architecture functions, there is likely to be a governance framework already 
in place, but specific processes, organizations, ro les, responsibilities, and measures may need to 
be defined on a project-by-project basis. 
The Implementation Governance Model produced as an output of Phase F ensures that a project 
transitioning into implementation moves smoothly into appropriate Architecture Governance.

TOGAF® 9 Foundation Study Guide, 2nd Edition  147 12.3.16 Organizational Model for Enterprise Architecture 
An important deliverable of the Preliminary Ph ase is the Organizational Model for Enterprise 
Architecture. 
In order for an architecture framework to be  used successfully, it must be supported by the 
correct organization, roles, and responsibilities with in the enterprise. Of particular importance is 
the definition of boundaries between different enterprise architecture practitioners and the 
governance relationships that span across these boundaries. 
12.3.17 Request for Architecture Work 
This is a document that is sent from the sponsor ing organization to the architecture organization 
to trigger the start of an Architecture Devel opment Cycle. Requests for Architecture Work can 
be created as an output of the Preliminary Phase, a result of approved architecture Change 
Requests, or terms of reference for architectur e work originating from migration planning. 
In general, all the information in th is document should be at a high level. 
12.3.18 Requirements Impact Assessment 
Throughout the ADM, new information is collect ed relating to an architecture. As this 
information is gathered, new facts may come to  light that invalidate existing aspects of the 
architecture. A Requirements Impact Assessmen t assesses the current architecture requirements 
and specification to identify changes that should be  made and the implications of those changes. 
12.3.19 Solution Building Blocks 
Implementation-specific building blocks from the enterprise's Architecture Repository. 
See Chapter 11. 
12.3.20 Statement of Architecture Work 
The Statement of Architecture Work is create d as a deliverable from Phase A and defines the 
scope and approach that will be used to comp lete an architecture development cycle. The 
Statement of Architecture Work is typically th e document against which successful execution of 
the architecture project will be measured and ma y form the basis for a contractual agreement 
between the supplier and consumer of architecture services. 
12.3.21 Tailored Architecture Framework 
Selecting and tailoring a framework is the practi cal starting point for an architecture project. 
TOGAF provides an industry standard framework fo r architecture that may be used in a wide 
variety of organizations. However, before TOGAF can be effectively used within an architecture 
project, tailoring at two levels is necessary. 
Firstly, it is necessary to tailor the TOGAF mode l for integration into the enterprise. This 
tailoring will include integration with pr oject and process management frameworks, 
customization of terminology, development of pr esentational styles, selection, configuration, and 
Personal PDF Edition

148  Study Guide (2011) deployment of architecture tools, etc. The formality and detail of any frameworks adopted 
should also align with other contextual factors for the enterprise, such as culture, stakeholders, 
commercial models for enterprise architecture, and the existing level of architecture capability. 
Once the framework has been tailore d to the enterprise, further ta iloring is necessary in order to 
fit the framework to the speci fic architecture project. Tailoring at this level will select 
appropriate deliverables and artifacts to meet project and stakeholder needs. 
12.4 Summary 
Architecture deliverables are the contractual or fo rmal work products of an architecture project. 
The definitions provided by TOGAF are a base line and thus a starting point for tailoring.

• What is the TOGAF Technical Reference Model? 
• What are the characteristics of a Foundation Architecture? 
• What are the basic concepts of the Integrat ed Information Infrastructure Reference Model

13.2 The TOGAF TRM as a Foundation Architecture 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 12, Learning Outcome 1: You should be able to explain the role of the 
TRM as a Foundation Architecture.) 
A Foundation Architecture is an architecture of bui lding blocks and corresponding standards that 
supports all the Common Systems Architectures,  and, therefore, the complete computing 
environment. A Foundation Architecture is positione d at the left-hand side of the Enterprise 
Continuum. 
TOGAF includes the Technical Reference Mode l (TRM) as its Foundation Architecture. The 
ADM explains how to develop from this generic foundation architect ure to an enterprise-specific 
one. The TOGAF TRM describes a fundamental ar chitecture upon which other, more specific, 
architectures can be based. 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 12, Learning Outcom e 2: You should be able to describe the 
characteristics of a Foundation Architecture.) 
Major characteristics of a Foundation Architecture include the following: 
• It reflects general computing requirements. 
• It reflects general building blocks. 
• It defines technology standards fo r implementing these building blocks.

• It reflects the function of a complete, robust computing environment that can be used as a 
foundation. 
• It provides open system standards, directions, and recommendations. 
• It reflects directions and strategies. 
The TRM has two main components: 
1. A taxonomy that defines terminology, and provides a coherent description of the 
components and conceptual structure of an information system 
2. A model, with an associated TRM graphic, that provides a visual representation of the 
taxonomy, as an aid to understanding 
Figure 28 shows the high-level model of the TRM. The three main parts of the TRM 
(Application Software, Application Platform, a nd Communications Infrastructure) are connected 
by two interfaces (Application Platform Interface and Communications Infrastructure Interface).

13.3 The Integrated Information In frastructure Reference Model 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 12, Learning Outcome 3:  You should be able to briefly explain the 
basic concepts of the III-RM.)  
With the emergence of Internet-based technologies in recent years, for many organizations the 
main focus of attention, and the main return on investment in architecture effort, has shifted 
from the Application Platform space, modeled by the TRM, to the Application Software space. 
In response to this The Open Group develope d the Integrated Information Infrastructure 
Reference Model (III-RM). 
The III-RM is a reference model that focuses on the Application Software space, and is a 
“Common Systems Architecture” in Enterprise Continuum terms. The III-RM is a subset of the 
TOGAF TRM in terms of its overall scope, but it also expands certain parts of the TRM – in 
particular, the business applications and infrastruct ure applications parts – in order to provide 
help in addressing one of the key challenges faci ng the enterprise architect today: the need to 
design an integrated information infrastructure to enable Boundaryless Information Flow. These 
concepts are explained in detail below. 
Like the TOGAF TRM, the III-RM has two main components:

components and conceptual structure of an  integrated information infrastructure

It is fundamentally an Application Architecture reference model – a model of the application 
components and application services software  essential for an integrated information 
infrastructure. It includes information provide r and consumer applications, as well as brokering 
applications. Further detail is covere d in the TOGAF 9 Certified Syllabus. 
 III-RM  
The Open Group has documented the business scenario that led to the creation of the Integrated 
Information Infrastructure Reference Model (III-RM)  in the Interoperable Enterprise Business 
Scenario (Doc. No. K022). This is freely ava ilable for download from the Business Scenarios 
section of The Open Group online bookstore at www.opengroup.org/bookstore . 
13.4 Boundaryless Information Flow 
(Syllabus Reference: Unit 12, Learning Outcome 4:  You should be able to briefly explain the 
relationship of the III-RM to the con cept of Boundaryless Information Flow.)  
The Boundaryless Information Flow problem space is one that is shared by many customer 
members of The Open Group, and by many simila r organizations worldwide. It is essentially the 
problem of getting information to the right people  at the right time in a secure, reliable manner, 
in order to support the operations that are core to the extended enterprise. 
In General Electric, Jack Welch invented th e term “the Boundaryless Organization”, not to 
imply that there are no boundaries, but that they should be made permeable.

154  Study Guide (2011) Creating organizational structures that enable d each individual department to operate at 
maximum efficiency was for a long time accepte d as the best approach to managing a large 
enterprise. Among other benefits, this approach fo stered the development of specialist skills in 
staff, who could apply those skills to speci fic aspects of an overall activity (such as a 
manufacturing process), in order to accomplish the tasks involved better, faster, and cheaper. 
As each overall activity progressed through th e organization, passing from department to 
department (for example, from Design to Produc tion to Sales), each department would take 
inputs from the previous department in the process, apply its own business processes to the 
activity, and send its output to the next department in line. 
In today's world where speed, flexibility, and responsiveness to changing markets make the 
difference between success and failure, this method of working is no longer appropriate. 
Organizations have been trying for some time to  overcome the limitations  imposed by traditional 
organization structures. Many business process re-eng ineering efforts have been undertaken and 
abandoned because they were too ambitious, while others cost far more in both time and money 
than originally intended. 
However, organizations today recognize that th ey need not abandon functional or departmental 
organization altogether. They can enable the right  people to come together in cross-functional 
teams so that all the skills, knowledge, and expertise can be brought to bear on any specific 
problem or business opportunity. 
But this in turn poses its own challenges. CIOs  are under enormous pressure to provide access to 
information to each cross-functional team on an as-required basis, and yet the sources of this 
data can be numerous and the volumes huge. 
Even worse, the IT systems, which have been bu ilt over a period of 20 or 30 years at a cost of 
many billions of dollars, and are not about to be thrown out or replaced wholesale, were built for 
each functional department. So although it may be  possible to get people to work together 
effectively (no minor achievement in itself), the IT systems they use are designed to support the 
old-style thinking. The IT systems in place today do  not allow for information to flow in support 
of the boundaryless organization. When they do,  then we will have Boundaryless Information 
Flow. 
The Open Group's Interoperable Enterprise Busine ss Scenario, originally published in 2001, 
crystallizes this need for Boundaryless Informati on Flow and describes the way in which this 
need drives IT customers' deployment of their information infrastructure. 
In this scenario, the customer's problem statemen t says that the customer enterprise could gain 
significant operational efficiencies and improve the many different business processes of the 
enterprise – both internal processes, and those spanning the key interactions with suppliers, 
customers, and partners – if only it could provide staff with: 
• Integrated information  so that different and potentia lly conflicting pieces of information 
are not distributed throughout different systems 
• Integrated access to that information  so that staff can access all the information they need 
and have a right to, through one convenient interface 
The infrastructure that enables this vision is te rmed the “integrated information infrastructure”.

TOGAF® 9 Foundation Study Guide, 2nd Edition  155 One of the key challenges for the architect in today’s enterprise is to  work out, and then 
communicate to senior management, how far technologies such as web services, application integration services, etc. can go toward achieving an integrated information infrastructure, and 
realizing the vision of Boundaryless Inform ation Flow, in the enterprise concerned. 
The Open Group’s follow-up analysis of the Interoperable Enterprise Business Scenario has 
resulted in the development of an integrated  information infrastructure model (the III-RM), 
which depicts the major components required to address the Boundaryless Information Flow 
problem space, and can help the architect in this task. 
The III-RM thus provides insights related to cust omer needs for Boundaryless Information Flow 
in enterprise environments. The model also points to rules and standards to assist in leveraging 
solutions and products within the value chain. 
 Boundaryless Information Flow 
1. A trademark of The Open Group. 
2. A shorthand representation of “access to integrated information to support business process 
improvements” representing a desired state of an  enterprise's infrastructure specific to the 
business needs of the organization. 
An infrastructure that provides Boundaryless Information Flow has open standard components 
that provide services in a customer's extended enterprise that: 
• Combine multiple sources of information 
• Securely deliver the information whenever and wherever it is needed, in the right 
context for the people or systems using that information 
[Source: TOGAF 9 Part I: Introduction, Chapter 3 (Definitions)] 
13.5 Summary 
The TOGAF Technical Reference Model provid es a model and core taxonomy of generic 
platform services. In summary: 
• It is a Foundation Architecture. 
• It can be used to build any system architecture. 
• A taxonomy defines consistent terminology. 
The III-RM is a model of the key components for developing, managing, and operating an 
integrated information infrastructure. In summary: 
• It is an example of a Common Systems Architecture. 
• The focus is on applications rather than the platform. 
• It has two main components: a taxonomy and an associated graphic.

156  Study Guide (2011) • A key driver for development of the model is  the need for Boundaryless Information Flow; 
getting information to the right people at the right time in a secure, reliable, and timely manner.

This is the best answer. TOGAF is a framework - a detailed method and a set of supporting tools - for 
developing an enterprise architecture. 
Item 2     B 
PART II: Architecture Development Me thod describes t he TOGAF Architecture Development Method (ADM) - 
a step-by-step approach to developing an enterpr ise architecture in a number of phases. 
Item 3     E 
An architecture framework is a foundational structure,  or set of structures, which can be used for developing 
a broad range of different architectures. It should desc ribe a method for designing a target state of the 
enterprise in terms of a set of building blocks, and for showing how the building blocks fit together. It should 
contain a set of tools and provide a common vocabul ary. It should also include a list of recommended 
standards and compliant products that can be used to implement the building blocks. 
Item 4     C 
Phase C: Information Systems Architectures descr ibes the development of Information Systems 
Architectures for an architecture project, including t he development of Data and Application Architectures. 
Item 5     D 
A deliverable is a work product that is contractually  specified and in turn formally reviewed, agreed, and 
signed off by the stakeholders. Deliverables represent t he output of projects and t hose deliverables that are 
in documentation form will typically be archived at completion of a project, or  transitioned into an Architecture 
Repository as a reference model, standard, or snapshot  of the Architecture Landscape at a point in time.

TOGAF® 9 Foundation Study Guide, 2nd Edition  173 Item 6     E 
The Enterprise Continuum is a model providing methods for classifying architecture and solution artifacts as 
they evolve from generic Foundation Architectures to Organization-Specific Architectures. The Enterprise 
Continuum comprises two complementary concepts : the Architecture Continuum and the Solutions 
Continuum. 
Item 7     E 
Phase E: Opportunities & Solutions conducts initial im plementation planning and the identification of delivery 
vehicles for the architecture defined in the previous phases. 
Item 8     B 
The first execution of the ADM will oft en be the hardest, since the architecture assets available for re-use will 
be relatively scarce. Even at this stage of development, however, there will be architecture assets available 
from external sources such as TOGAF, as well as the IT industry at large, that could be leveraged in support 
of the effort. 
Item 9     D 
Output is generated throughout the ADM process, and  output in an early phase may be modified in a later 
phase. TOGAF recommends that the versioning of output  is managed through version numbers. In all cases, 
the ADM numbering scheme is provided as an example. It should be adapted by the architect to meet the 
requirements of the organization and to work with the ar chitecture tools and repositories employed by the 
organization. 
Item 10    E 
Organization-Specific Architectures are viewed as be ing at the right end of the Architecture Continuum, and 
are the most relevant to the IT customer community, since they describe and gui de the final deployment of 
solution components for a particular enterprise or extended network of connected enterprises. 
Item 11    C 
The Enterprise Continuum provides a view of the Archit ecture Repository that s hows the evolution of these 
related architectures from generic to specific, from ab stract to concrete, and from logical to physical. 
Item 12    E 
The Solutions Continuum defines what is available in  the organizational environment as re-usable Solution 
Building Blocks (SBBs). 
Item 13    E 
The Solutions Continuum is a population of the architectu re with reference building blocks - either purchased 
products or built components - that represent a soluti on to the enterprise's busine ss need expressed at that 
level. 
Item 14    D 
Strategic change is a business driver. 
Item 15    C 
When an existing application is replaced, there will be a cr itical need to migrate data (master, transactional, 
and reference) to the new application. The Data Archit ecture should identify data migration requirements and 
also provide indicators as to the level of transform ation, weeding, and cleansing that will be required to 
present data in a format that meets the require ments and constraints of the target application.

A knowledge of the Business Architecture is a prerequisi te for architecture work in any other domain (Data, 
Application, Technology), and is theref ore the first architecture activity that needs to be undertaken, if not 
catered for already in other organizational processe s (enterprise planning, strategic business planning, 
business process re-engineering, etc.). 
Item 23    D 
Capability-Based Planning is a business planning technique that focuses on business outcomes. It focuses 
on the planning, engineering, and delivery of strategic bu siness capabilities to the enterprise. It is business-
driven and business-led and combines the requisite effo rts of all lines of business to achieve the desired 
capability. Capability-Based Planning accommodates most, if  not all, of the corporate business models and is 
especially useful in organization s where a latent capability to resp ond (e.g., an emergency  preparedness unit) 
is required and the same resources are involved in multiple capabilities. 
Item 24    B 
Business Transformation Readiness is first assessed in Phase A, so actions can be worked into Phases E 
and F in the Implementation and Migration Plan. 
Item 25    C 
The risk categorization after implementation of mitigati ng actions is known as "Residual Level of Risk". 
Item 26    C 
Principles are intended to be enduring and seldom amended. 
Item 27    D

requirements of the business. They are used to hel p identify and understand business needs, and thereby to 
derive the business requirements that the architecture development has to address. 
Item 28    C 
A key step in validating an architecture is to consider what may have been forgotten. 
Item 29    E 
A key element in a successful architecture governance st rategy is a cross-organization Architecture Board to 
oversee the implementation of the strategy. 
Item 30    A 
TOGAF describes "compliant" as a situation where some  features in an architectu re specification have not 
been implemented, but those that have are in  accordance with the specification. 
Item 31    B 
The Compliance process ensures regulatory requirements are being met. 
Item 32    C 
The Data Architecture would define t he structure of the organization's En terprise Continuum and Architecture 
Repository. 
Item 33    B 
A view is what you see. A viewpoint is where you ar e looking from - the vantage point or perspective that 
determines what you see. 
Item 34    D 
"Concerns" are the key interests that are crucially im portant to the stakeholders  in the system, and determine 
the acceptability of the system. Concerns may perta in to any aspect of the system’s functioning, 
development, or operation, including considerations such as performance, reliability,  security, distribution, 
and evolvability. The terms "concern" and "requirement" are not synonymous. Concerns are the root of the 
process of decomposition into requirements. Concer ns are represented in the architecture by these 
requirements. Requirements should be SMART (e.g., specific metrics). 
Item 35    A 
TOGAF considers re-usability an attribute of a good building block. 
Item 36    B 
An ABB has fundamental functionality and attributes: se mantic, unambiguou s, including security capability
