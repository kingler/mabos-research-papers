Abstract  
This article  deals with the statistical nature of the price fluctuation . Although the price movements are roughly described as the 
Brownian motion, a certain discrepancy  exists between the theoretically anticipated pure Gaussian random walk and the observed 
heavy -tailed distributions. In order to settle down this problem, the authors have surveyed massive database supplied by the 
newly developed stock trading system calle d “arrowhead trading system” in Tokyo  Security Exchange Market  (TSE), and have 
reached  a conclusion supported by various numerical  results, that the fundamental process of arrowhead price movements can be 
identified as the Gaussian random walk, or reaching toward Gaussian random walk corresponding to the index  of Lévy  stable  
distribution, α = 2.0 , to realize the efficient market as t he time intervals going smaller from a few minutes to a few s econd s. Also, 
the compound motion made by multiple consecutive motions that corresponds to the tail part of the distribution or the average  
price like various indices such as T SE Index in Japan o r S&P500 in the U.S.A. tends to show the scale -free property 
corresponding to α = 1.4 - 1.7.

1. Introduction  
Since the work of Luis Bachelier [1], the nature of price fluctuation is known to be the random walk (Brownian

motion ) and the theory of financial technology is established on this base to evalua te, e.g., derivative prices such as  
Black -Sholes -Merton (BSM) formula [2,3,4]. However, the BSM formula has several kinds of difficulty, and often 
fails to describe the real world. For example, the parameter σ (volatility) is assumed to be a certain consta nt in the 
above formula because there is no reliable way to compute its value theoretically. A commonly used substitute for the 
volatility is the ‘historical volatility', or the realized volatility', that is the average values of the standard deviation over 
the historical price data over a fixed length, such as 2 weeks. Another substitute is the ‘implied volatility' to obtain σ 
by inversely solving the BSM formula from for the actual price time series of the option prices. However, the 
obtained values σ are  not a constant but varies as a function of K (the target price of each option) of the same option 
for different te rms T. This is known as the ‘smile curve' because the σ -K plot shapes concave and resembles the 
‘smile' mark. Considering the importance of t he derivation of the BSM formula in financial engineering, it is essential 
to solve the problem of σ.  
From physics point of view,  on the other hand,  price fluctuation provides us a fruitful  playground to test the 
relation ship between  the sca ling and critic al phenomena [6,7] . Stimulated by the discovery of scale -free property in 
price time series [ 8], a new field of interdisciplinary science on the price motions and its related phenomena have 
been practiced under the name of “econo -physics” [ 9,10]. There the universality of scale -free phenomena in a wide 
range of sciences have been much em phasized . Among them, the price dynamics was depicted as a typical example of 
having the scale -free property over the widest range of time resolution [1 1-13].  
This direction of thought. however, often caused frustration between the ‘scale -free’ hypothesis in physics and the 
‘random walk’ hypothesis in financial engineering. We attempted to solve  this problem  by means of direct numerical 
study of large -sized financia l data provided by the recently developed ultra -high speed transaction at half a 
millisecond in Tokyo market, called ‘arrowhead market’.  
The rest of  the paper is structured as follows.  In Section 2, the formulation of price dynamics  is summarize d. Then 
the latest result of numerical analyses based on  newly obtained full arrowhead stock price data  are described in 
Section 3 and 4.  Based on the detailed analysis of the most actively traded stock price of code number 8306 for four 
and a half years of August 2014- December 2018 to show that the fundamental price move behaves as the Gaussian 
random walk as expected by financial engineering. Then we proceed to show that the scale -free mechanism holds for 
the price motions of multiple steps  as well as for the ave rage prices like financial index, based on the scaling analysis 
of the stock index named T SE index for 14 years of April 2005 - December 2018 . Finally, Section 5 is devoted for the 
conclusion.  
2. Statistical distribution of the price increments  
The main variable of our interest is the price increment   
𝑧𝑧=𝑋𝑋(𝑡𝑡+∆𝑡𝑡)−𝑋𝑋(𝑡𝑡)                                                                  (1) 
of the asset price  𝑋𝑋(𝑡𝑡) time 𝑡𝑡 and 𝑋𝑋(𝑡𝑡+∆𝑡𝑡) at 𝑡𝑡+∆𝑡𝑡. The main task is to clarify whether the statistical distribution 
of the price increments is Gaus sian, or not Gaussian having fat-tails and narrow necks. Several decades ago, it was 
pointed out by Mandelbrot then followed by Mantegna and Stanley that the probability distri bution of asset returns 
follow Lévy  stable distribution, defined as  
𝑓𝑓 𝛼𝛼,𝛽𝛽(𝑍𝑍)=1
2𝜋𝜋∫ 𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖−𝛽𝛽|𝑖𝑖|𝛼𝛼 ∞
−∞𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑                                                                  (2) 
which is the Fourier transform of the kernel F(k) given by  
𝐹𝐹 𝛼𝛼,𝛽𝛽(𝑑𝑑)=𝑒𝑒−𝛽𝛽|𝑖𝑖|𝛼𝛼                                                                                     (3) 
The first paramete r 𝛼𝛼 characterizes the distribution and is called Lévy  index, taking the range of  1≤𝛼𝛼≤2, and
the second parameter 𝛽𝛽 is proportional to the time i nterval ∆𝑡𝑡, as follows.  
𝛽𝛽=𝛾𝛾𝛥𝛥𝑡𝑡                                                                                               (4) 
Note tha t (2) can be integrated for two special cases, α=1 and α=2, first of which is the Lorentz distribution,  
𝑃𝑃 𝛼𝛼=1,𝛽𝛽(𝑍𝑍)=𝛽𝛽
𝜋𝜋1
𝛽𝛽2+𝑖𝑖2                                                                                 (5) 
and the second is the normal (Gaussian) distribution .

The main variable of our interest is the price increment   
𝑧𝑧=𝑋𝑋(𝑡𝑡+∆𝑡𝑡)−𝑋𝑋(𝑡𝑡)                                                                  (1)

of the price increments is Gaus sian, or not Gaussian having fat-tails and narrow necks. Several decades ago, it was 
pointed out by Mandelbrot then followed by Mantegna and Stanley that the probability distri bution of asset returns 
follow Lévy  stable distribution, defined as  
𝑓𝑓 𝛼𝛼,𝛽𝛽(𝑍𝑍)=1

which is the Fourier transform of the kernel F(k) given by  
𝐹𝐹 𝛼𝛼,𝛽𝛽(𝑑𝑑)=𝑒𝑒−𝛽𝛽|𝑖𝑖|𝛼𝛼                                                                                     (3)

and the second is the normal (Gaussian) distribution .

For general values of α, the distribution is computed by numerically integrating Eq. (2). The scale invariant property 
of Lévy stable distribution is derived from Eq. (2),  
 𝑃𝑃 𝛼𝛼,𝛽𝛽(𝑍𝑍/(𝛥𝛥𝑡𝑡)1/𝛼𝛼)=(𝛥𝛥𝑡𝑡)1/𝛼𝛼  𝑃𝑃 𝛼𝛼,𝛽𝛽∆𝑡𝑡(𝑍𝑍)                                                    (7) 
Setting Z=0 in Eq. (10), Lévy  index α is estimated by comparing the height of the distribution  𝑃𝑃∆𝑡𝑡(0) for various 
values of 𝛥𝛥𝑡𝑡.  
𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 ( 𝑃𝑃 𝛼𝛼,𝛽𝛽∆𝑡𝑡(0))=−1
𝛼𝛼𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 (𝛥𝛥𝑡𝑡)+𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙( 𝑃𝑃 𝛼𝛼,𝛽𝛽(0))                                     (8) 
The above scenario was applied on American stock index S&P500, per 1 minute for 1984 -1985, and per 15 
seconds for 1986 -1989, which was well -fitted to Lévy stable distribution around the center of the distribution, and 
the scale invariant property was proved in the range of ∆𝑡𝑡 =1-1000 min. [ 9]. 
The scale invariant property of Lévy stable distribution is derived from Eq. (2),  
 
 𝑃𝑃 𝛼𝛼,   𝛽𝛽( 𝑍𝑍 𝑠𝑠)=(𝛥𝛥𝑡𝑡)1/𝛼𝛼  𝑃𝑃 𝛼𝛼,   𝛽𝛽𝛥𝛥𝑡𝑡(𝑍𝑍)                                                             (9) 
 
 𝑍𝑍 𝑠𝑠=𝑍𝑍/(𝛥𝛥𝑡𝑡)1/𝛼𝛼                                                                                         (10) 
Except the case of Gauss distribution  α =2.0, when the volatility parameter  σ (equ ivalent to the standard 
distribution) determines the typical scale of the distribution,  Lévy stable distributions of index α < 2.0 has no 
parameter to determine the scale, and they are the scale -free distribution, or the scale -invariant distribution.  
3. Fundamental price dynamics seems to be  Gaussian   
3.1. Millisecond data became available by the ‘a rrowhead market ’ in Tokyo market  
The methodology stated above was originally proposed in Ref. [ 9, 10] to show that the price fluctuation has scale -
invariant property, originally suggested in Ref. [ 8] to explain risk in the speculative market. In both cases, Lévy 
stable distribution of index α < 2.0 was observed .  
Amazingly enough, the scale -invariance was observed for the extensive range of time resolution fro m a few 
minutes to s few days, for various financial time series [12 -14]. However, those results are based on the index time 
series, which are ‘average’ prices of various different stock prices, or ‘sum’ of prices of the same stock taken at 
different times . It is not quite evident whether the fundamental process of price fluctuation obeys Gauss distribution 
or non -Gaussian ‘scale -invariant’ stable distribution, unless any clear evidence of non -Gaussian distribution comes 
out of fundamental analysis.  
The ar rowhead market, that started in Tokyo market from the beginning of January 2010, is expected to give us a 
good chance to observe the fundamental process of price fluctuation. Having this hope in mind, the authors  focus on 
analysing the empirical statistica l distribution pf price fluctuation.  
At first,  it was highly difficult to access the full trad e data. Only an  extremely limited data of every 5 second 
interval became available on the webpage of TMIV (Tokyo Market Impact View)  for only 100 selected stocks,  from 
April to Dec. 2013 , which provides us, 720 points per hour , times 5 hours, times 179 days. The resulting data size is 
only 640,8 00 data points per each stock. The number of data points is not sufficient to draw a statistical distribution 
by a single stock time series only. Still the averag e of the 100 stocks makes us possible to draw histograms. The 
conclusion at that time was that the price fluctuation of this 100 stocks follow the Lévy  stable distribution of index 
α=1.4. This result was checked by using three different ways of analyses: scaling fit, time resolution dependence of 
P(0), and the Kullb uck-Leibler Divergence [14]. 
The second preliminary analysis of the same line of thought was performed by using  the full arrowhead data of 
half a milliseco nd resolution for 15 months from October ,2015 to the end of 2016 [1 5]. However, the data are 
highly sparse and not periodic. For example,  the most active stock (8306) in the most actively traded month 
(December, 2016) had only 31,418,450 transactions , which  is merely 0.3 percent of the total transaction chances of 
1,000,000,000 (2000 times per second * 60 minutes *60 hours * 5 hours * 28 days). That means roughly 99.7 per 
cent out of all the possible transactions at every 0.0005 second  are practically v acant. Therefore, the authors had to 
give up the maximum resolution , and decided to sample the original time series into rougher series per 0.1 second  Author name / Procedia Computer Science  00 (2019) 000 –000 
interval. Based on such sampled data, the authors  observed scale -invariant property quite well and identi fied the 
index  α of Lévy  distribution to be α = 1.7 ±0.3. However, this range of index is too wide by simultaneously 
allowing the Gaussian ( α =2.0) and the old -time Lévy index α=1.4 obtained for 1 -minute time series of the S&P500 
index thirty years ago as well as the a verage time series of 100 selected stocks per 5 seconds in our first analysis 
[14]. On the other hand, it is widely accepted in the real -world that the assumption of financial technology stands 
over the belief of Gaussian fluctuation of fundam ental moves of prices.  
In order to narrow down the error bar in the estimation of index  α, more data are necessary. It turns out a  
complete set of transaction prices, volumes and the transaction time to the accuracy of half of a millisecond for all 
the stocks traded in Tokyo Security Exchange market (TSE, hereafter) for seven years from 2012 to 2018, delivered 
by the JPX cloud servic e (http:// www.jpx.co.jp/ ) became available recently . This is a great opportunity to observe 
and analyse the fastest transaction data available at this point, and to  explore the world of sub -millisecond market 
system an d observe how the current status of security exchange market.   
3.2. Single stock price time series may exhibit the elementary price dynamics  
It is expected that the single stock time series at the minimum time interval contains the basic information on the 
elem entary price dynamics. At this moment, however, it is difficult to extract the price changes at the elementary 
level.  
our previous experience on analysing various market indices and average stock prices. At first, when we did not 
have sufficient data leng th to analy se, we used ind ex time series in order to obtain some sort of smooth distributions. 
Those ‘mixed’ time series tend to have smaller index values. Thus we expected that even if the fundamental motion 
of price fluctuation is Gaussian, there is a po ssibility of observing non -Gaussian distribution for mixed (averaged) 
time series.  
In order to identify the index  α based  on the scaling property of Eq.  (9), we pick up the most actively traded 
stock 8306 . Although the total data set , from the beginning of 2010 when the ‘Arrowhead system’ has started  to the 
end of 2018 , is available, only the period of August, 2014 - September, 2018 can be consistently used for the 
analysis  of the stock coded by 8306. The reason is due to the change of price resolution fr om 3 digits to 4 digits  
made by the system upgrade made during July 2014.  
Considering various limitations coming from the sparseness of the traded record, the optimum choice of the 
minimum time resolution turns out to be ∆𝑡𝑡=3.75 seconds , mainly to suppre ss the excess -zero-problem. The 
resulting number of total data points for 8306 becomes 4,776,995. By using this set of data,  the parameter α is 
estimated by t wo different methods . 
<Method 1> : Scaling the empirical probability distributions of various time resolutions  by properly choosing α 
The first method is to use the scaling property in Eq.(7). This is illustrated by two graphs in Fig.1. In the left figure, 
eight graphs of empirical probability distributions for various time resolutions, c orresponding to eight different time 
resolutions of 𝛥𝛥𝑡𝑡 = 3.75, 7.5, 15, 30, 60, 120, 240, 480 seconds  are simultaneously plotted. Those numbers are 
chosen to have 𝛥𝛥𝑡𝑡 = 2 in Eq. (7).  If the price time series of our concern obey a scale -invariant distribution such as 
Lévy stable distribution, we should be able to identify the scaling factor c = (𝛥𝛥𝑡𝑡)1/𝛼𝛼 =21/α so that all the eight lines 
to overlap on a single distribution if the facto r c is properly chosen. All the eight histograms can be scaled to a single 
curve by choosing c=√2 and the corresponding index is around α=2.0, as shown in the right figure of Fig.1.  
<Method 2> : Extract α from the slope of the log -log plot of P(0) and ∆𝑡𝑡 
Another method can be used to obtain the value of index  α from  Eq. (8). Corresponding to the time resolution ∆𝑡𝑡 = 
3.75, 7.5, 15, 30, 60, 120, 240, 480 , the peak P(0) of the probability distribution decreases according to Table 1, 
from which the index  α as the inverse of the slope of the log -log plot shown in Fig.2 is α=1.982 , consistent to α=2.0 
obtained from the graphical approach above. The stability of the index α is supported by the straightness of the line 
in Fig.2.  
Therefore, arrowhead price data for 8306 can be identified as the Gaussian distribution with high confidence 
level. Although the time resolution 3.75 seconds is still too large to be identified as the elementary process as a 
whole, it is expected that the large portion of fundamental price changes are contained in this range.

For general values of α, the distribution is computed by numerically integrating Eq. (2). The scale invariant property 
of Lévy stable distribution is derived from Eq. (2),  
 𝑃𝑃 𝛼𝛼,𝛽𝛽(𝑍𝑍/(𝛥𝛥𝑡𝑡)1/𝛼𝛼)=(𝛥𝛥𝑡𝑡)1/𝛼𝛼  𝑃𝑃 𝛼𝛼,𝛽𝛽∆𝑡𝑡(𝑍𝑍)                                                    (7) 
Setting Z=0 in Eq. (10), Lévy  index α is estimated by comparing the height of the distribution  𝑃𝑃∆𝑡𝑡(0) for various 
values of 𝛥𝛥𝑡𝑡.

The above scenario was applied on American stock index S&P500, per 1 minute for 1984 -1985, and per 15 
seconds for 1986 -1989, which was well -fitted to Lévy stable distribution around the center of the distribution, and 
the scale invariant property was proved in the range of ∆𝑡𝑡 =1-1000 min. [ 9]. 
The scale invariant property of Lévy stable distribution is derived from Eq. (2),  
 
 𝑃𝑃 𝛼𝛼,   𝛽𝛽( 𝑍𝑍 𝑠𝑠)=(𝛥𝛥𝑡𝑡)1/𝛼𝛼  𝑃𝑃 𝛼𝛼,   𝛽𝛽𝛥𝛥𝑡𝑡(𝑍𝑍)                                                             (9)

Except the case of Gauss distribution  α =2.0, when the volatility parameter  σ (equ ivalent to the standard 
distribution) determines the typical scale of the distribution,  Lévy stable distributions of index α < 2.0 has no 
parameter to determine the scale, and they are the scale -free distribution, or the scale -invariant distribution.  
3. Fundamental price dynamics seems to be  Gaussian   
3.1. Millisecond data became available by the ‘a rrowhead market ’ in Tokyo market  
The methodology stated above was originally proposed in Ref. [ 9, 10] to show that the price fluctuation has scale -
invariant property, originally suggested in Ref. [ 8] to explain risk in the speculative market. In both cases, Lévy 
stable distribution of index α < 2.0 was observed .  
Amazingly enough, the scale -invariance was observed for the extensive range of time resolution fro m a few 
minutes to s few days, for various financial time series [12 -14]. However, those results are based on the index time 
series, which are ‘average’ prices of various different stock prices, or ‘sum’ of prices of the same stock taken at 
different times . It is not quite evident whether the fundamental process of price fluctuation obeys Gauss distribution 
or non -Gaussian ‘scale -invariant’ stable distribution, unless any clear evidence of non -Gaussian distribution comes 
out of fundamental analysis.  
The ar rowhead market, that started in Tokyo market from the beginning of January 2010, is expected to give us a 
good chance to observe the fundamental process of price fluctuation. Having this hope in mind, the authors  focus on 
analysing the empirical statistica l distribution pf price fluctuation.  
At first,  it was highly difficult to access the full trad e data. Only an  extremely limited data of every 5 second 
interval became available on the webpage of TMIV (Tokyo Market Impact View)  for only 100 selected stocks,  from 
April to Dec. 2013 , which provides us, 720 points per hour , times 5 hours, times 179 days. The resulting data size is 
only 640,8 00 data points per each stock. The number of data points is not sufficient to draw a statistical distribution 
by a single stock time series only. Still the averag e of the 100 stocks makes us possible to draw histograms. The 
conclusion at that time was that the price fluctuation of this 100 stocks follow the Lévy  stable distribution of index 
α=1.4. This result was checked by using three different ways of analyses: scaling fit, time resolution dependence of 
P(0), and the Kullb uck-Leibler Divergence [14]. 
The second preliminary analysis of the same line of thought was performed by using  the full arrowhead data of 
half a milliseco nd resolution for 15 months from October ,2015 to the end of 2016 [1 5]. However, the data are 
highly sparse and not periodic. For example,  the most active stock (8306) in the most actively traded month 
(December, 2016) had only 31,418,450 transactions , which  is merely 0.3 percent of the total transaction chances of 
1,000,000,000 (2000 times per second * 60 minutes *60 hours * 5 hours * 28 days). That means roughly 99.7 per

Note that in our previous analysis using log -returns defined in Eq.(1) between all the adjacent transactions of 8306, 
we disregarded time stamps and simply took the log -difference between two adjacent prices, such as  
𝑍𝑍(𝑖𝑖)=𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 (𝑖𝑖+1)−𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 𝑙𝑙(𝑖𝑖)                                                                  (1a) 
for all the recorded prices for i=1, …, n, where n represents the total number of data points. The statistical 
distribution of the resulting time series of Z(i) can be fitted to Gaussian distribution with index α=2.0, as shown in 
the last two figures of out last work (Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 in Ref. 1 5). In that analysis, most data points practically 
belong to sub -second region, although not at any fixed times, thus such  data mostly consist of single motions. This 
fact can be regarded as another proof, from a different direction, for the statement that a single price moves 
according to Gaussian random walk.  
   The same conclusion has also been obtained in many other stock s. However, the density of non -vacant data points 
for other stocks are even lower than the case of 8306 and the figures are less clear than the case of 8306. We expect to have much denser transactions for many other stocks, where we should be able to obtai n clear -cut figures in the 
 Author name / Procedia Computer Science  00 (2019) 000 –000 
near future.  
    Based on the above mentioned results, we conclude that the scaling analysis based on Eq.(9) suggests us that a 
single stock under sub -second (‘Arrowhead’) time resolution obeys Gaussian random walk whose probabil ity 
distribution has the stable distribution of index α =2.0. Yet a serious question remains on the fat -tail property of the 
statistical distribution of price increments. It is clear that the both tails of Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 seem far from the 
Gaussian (normal) distribution. The only possible explanation is to ad mit that, although a single price change 
behaves like the Gaussian random walk, multiple steps of price fluctuation are not. Individual steps are not mutually 
independent but influenced by interaction. Suppose if they were indeed i.i.d., then the stable di stribution holds the 
same index α under convolution of two stochastic variables following the same stable distributions: i.e., z=x+y 
follows L évy stable distribution of inde x α if both x and y follow  Lévy stable distribution of the same index α. This 
means  that the distribution of asset returns at ∆t=1 follows the same distribution as the same asset returns at ∆t=2.

   The fact that both tales are not Gaussian tells us the simple convolution story in Eqs. (11) -(13) fails in the price 
dynamics.  
 
4 . Index time series have smaller  α 
Recall that scale -free Lévy stable distributions of index α=1.4 < 2.0 was derived for S&500 in Ref. [ 9]. The same 
result was also derived in our previous work in Ref. [1 4] for the average stock price increments over 100 selected 
stocks. Taking this coincidence seriously, we can draw another scenario that index time series are non -Gaussian due 
to a compound effect.  
Just like the multiple steps in the region of both tails in the single stock time series, summing up over different 
stocks may also cause a kind of compound effect on the process connecting multiple elementary steps of price 
motions to make various indices . In order to confirm this scenario by the real data, we have analyzed various stock 
indices available in the JPX cloud service (http:/ /www.jpx.co.jp/ ). Among them, we select an example of TSE -big-
company index . The to tal number of data points are 3,834,275 from April 2005 to December 2018.  
<Method 1>  Scaling the empirical probability distributions of various time resolutions  by properly choosing α 
Parallel to the case of the single stock data for 8306 in the previous s ection, the first method to extract α from the 
data i s to use the scaling property of Eq.(7). This is illustrated by two graphs in Fig. 3. In the left figure, six graphs of 
empirical probability distributions of different levels of coarse graining, named as  15001.dat, 15002.dat, 15003.dat, 
15004.dat, and 15005.dat, corresponding to the time resolution  𝛥𝛥𝑡𝑡 = 15, 30, 60, 120, 240, 480 seconds are 
simultaneously plotted. Those numbers are chosen to have 𝛥𝛥𝑡𝑡 = 2 in Eq. (7). If the price time series obey a scal e-
invariant distribution such as Lévy stable distribution, the value of α can be obtained by pro perly choosing the scal e 
factor c = (𝛥𝛥𝑡𝑡)1/𝛼𝛼 =21/α so that all the six lines to overlap on a single distribution. This is done by choosing c = 
1.503  and the corresponding index is around α = 1.7  by means of Eq. (9) taking  𝛥𝛥𝑡𝑡 = 2, as shown in the right figure 
of Fig. 3.  
<Method 2> : Extract α from the slope of the log -log plot of P(0) and ∆𝑡𝑡 
The second method to obtain the value of index  α is to use Eq. (8). Corresponding to the time resolution ∆𝑡𝑡 = 15, 30, 
60, 120, 240, 480 second , the peak P(0) of the probability distribution decreases according to Table 1, from which

Note that in our previous analysis using log -returns defined in Eq.(1) between all the adjacent transactions of 8306, 
we disregarded time stamps and simply took the log -difference between two adjacent prices, such as

for all the recorded prices for i=1, …, n, where n represents the total number of data points. The statistical 
distribution of the resulting time series of Z(i) can be fitted to Gaussian distribution with index α=2.0, as shown in 
the last two figures of out last work (Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 in Ref. 1 5). In that analysis, most data points practically 
belong to sub -second region, although not at any fixed times, thus such  data mostly consist of single motions. This 
fact can be regarded as another proof, from a different direction, for the statement that a single price moves 
according to Gaussian random walk.  
   The same conclusion has also been obtained in many other stock s. However, the density of non -vacant data points 
for other stocks are even lower than the case of 8306 and the figures are less clear than the case of 8306. We expect

    Based on the above mentioned results, we conclude that the scaling analysis based on Eq.(9) suggests us that a 
single stock under sub -second (‘Arrowhead’) time resolution obeys Gaussian random walk whose probabil ity

follows L évy stable distribution of inde x α if both x and y follow  Lévy stable distribution of the same index α. This

4 . Index time series have smaller  α 
Recall that scale -free Lévy stable distributions of index α=1.4 < 2.0 was derived for S&500 in Ref. [ 9]. The same 
result was also derived in our previous work in Ref. [1 4] for the average stock price increments over 100 selected 
stocks. Taking this coincidence seriously, we can draw another scenario that index time series are non -Gaussian due 
to a compound effect.  
Just like the multiple steps in the region of both tails in the single stock time series, summing up over different 
stocks may also cause a kind of compound effect on the process connecting multiple elementary steps of price 
motions to make various indices . In order to confirm this scenario by the real data, we have analyzed various stock 
indices available in the JPX cloud service (http:/ /www.jpx.co.jp/ ). Among them, we select an example of TSE -big-
company index . The to tal number of data points are 3,834,275 from April 2005 to December 2018.  
<Method 1>  Scaling the empirical probability distributions of various time resolutions  by properly choosing α 
Parallel to the case of the single stock data for 8306 in the previous s ection, the first method to extract α from the 
data i s to use the scaling property of Eq.(7). This is illustrated by two graphs in Fig. 3. In the left figure, six graphs of 
empirical probability distributions of different levels of coarse graining, named as  15001.dat, 15002.dat, 15003.dat, 
15004.dat, and 15005.dat, corresponding to the time resolution  𝛥𝛥𝑡𝑡 = 15, 30, 60, 120, 240, 480 seconds are 
simultaneously plotted. Those numbers are chosen to have 𝛥𝛥𝑡𝑡 = 2 in Eq. (7). If the price time series obey a scal e-
invariant distribution such as Lévy stable distribution, the value of α can be obtained by pro perly choosing the scale  
factor c = (𝛥𝛥𝑡𝑡)1/𝛼𝛼 =21/α so that all the six lines to overlap on a single distribution. This is done by choosing c = 
1.503  and the corresponding index is around α = 1.7  by means of Eq. (9) taking  𝛥𝛥𝑡𝑡 = 2, as shown in the right figure 
of Fig. 3.  
<Method 2> : Extract α from the slope of the log -log plot of P(0) and ∆𝑡𝑡 
The second method to obtain the value of index  α is to use Eq. (8). Corresponding to the time resolution ∆𝑡𝑡 = 15, 30, 
60, 120, 240, 480 second , the peak P(0) of the probability distribution decreases according to Table 1, from which

the index  α as the inverse of the slope of the log -log plot shown in Fig.2 is α=1.982, consistent to α=2.0 obtained 
from the graphical approach above. The stability of the index α is supported by the straightness of the line in Fig.2.

5. Conclusion  
In this paper, w e focused  to clarify whether the price fluctuation under sub -second transaction exhibit a sign of 
Gaussian, or non -Gaussian, by directly analyzing the full transaction data which became available recently. Our 
result shows that the price time series of a single sto ck (8306) for the duration of 50 months in the period of August, 
2014 -Septermber, 2018 behaves Gaussian, corresponding to the stable distribution of index α = 2.0, in the most part 
of the actual transactions. We have reached this conclusion based on the fa ct that the scaling analysis of distribution 
functions of various time resolution can be overlapped on a single function for the index α=2.0. However, the both 
tails of the distribution deviate from the pure Gauss function, although the probability that th e tails are not 
significantly large.  As a possible answer to explain this difficulty, we postulated that the central region and the tail 
 Author name / Procedia Computer Science  00 (2019) 000 –000 
region are made up from different mechanisms. Especially in the arrowhead market where the transaction speed is 
very fa st, the central region of the distribution consists of fundamental motions of prices, thus corresponds to 
Gaussian random walk with index α = 2.0. On the other hand, the tail region of the distribution consists of 
compound motion s made by multiple consecutive motions , where the mutual dependence of elementally moves 
cause the deviation from the pure convolution mechanism in Eq.(11) -(13). We also postulate that various indices 
made up of averaging many stocks deviate from Gaussian, due to similar mechanism as the case of the tail region of 
distribution for single stock prices. In order to confirm this postulate, we have analyzed various stock indices and 
show as an example the case of tse-BIG-stock-index that they indeed fit the curv e of α = 1.7 < 2.0.
