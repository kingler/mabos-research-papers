ABSTRACT 
 
Assessing NASA Strategic Project Leadership in an Era of “Better, Faster, Cheaper” 
 
The purpose of this study was to develop a be tter understanding of the m anagement of strategic 
system projects (and programs) at NASA and, in par ticular, what makes such projects successful 
or not in an era of “better, faster, cheaper” (BFC).   Such projects are typically characterized by 
advanced technology, new types of missions, co mplex integration of hardware and software 
systems, and inflexible time frames that ar e often dictated by “launch windows.” To analyze 
strategic projects, this invest igation used the framework of Strategic Project Leadership ® (SPL)1 
correlated to the success of a sy stems development project through case study research.  Four 
NASA projects were investigated that were managed as BFC projects.  Two of them were 
successes (Mars Pathfinder and Lunar Prospector), and two failures (CONTOUR and Mars Climate Orbiter).  The objectives were to  (1) develop a better conceptual understanding of 
strategic system innov ation through the study of BFC projects, (2) understand how SPL can 
describe BFC projects, and (3) provide feedba ck, recommendations, and lessons learned to 
NASA and the aerospace industry on potential success cr iteria for BFC projects.  Of particular 
interest in this study was the analysis of fit between project type and the appropriate project 
management style. This research found that  there was a good fit between project type and 
project management style in the two successful projec ts while in the unsuccessful projects this fit 
was apparently missing. It seems there is a need to develop a specific NASA framework to 
assess a project’s risk and its appropr iate project management style.

1.  INTRODUCTION 
Both “project” and “project management” can be defined in very basic terms (Meredith and 
Mantel, 1995; PMI, 2004).  What are traditionally not  well defined are the complex activity of a 
project and how this activity is managed.  Although there are texts and guidebooks written on 
project management that give standard definitions, t heories, processes, and strategies to apply to 
projects in general, some have theorized that projec ts carry a complexity all their own and that no 
single management style can fit all projec ts (Amara, 1990; Shenhar, 1998b; Shenhar, 2001a).  
The complexity of a project alone alters t he management style and strategy of a project.  
Therefore, it should become clear that no one approach can solve the problems of project 
management, and thus no one strategy is best fo r any one project (Drejer, 1996).  Various 
strategies for project management are prevalent  throughout the literature (O’Brien and Smith, 
1997; Husain and Sushil, 1997).  Though the proj ect management strategies for building the 
Space Shuttle or designing a calculator can be e ffective and efficient, both are very different.   
 
Theories and processes for managing projects with  a more effective and efficient approach are 
not new to project management (e.g. Management by Objectives  [Druker, 1998], Total Quality 
Management  [Berk and Berk, 1993], Theory of Constraint  [Goldratt, 1997], The Fifth Discipline  
[Senge, et al., 1994]).  Likewise, management strat egies for a better, faster, cheaper or leaner 
project are not new to the field of proj ect management.  This type of management has been 
characterized by many other management classi fications: Skunk Works (Johnson, 1990; Peters, 
1983; Boomer, et al., 2000), Innovation Managem ent, High-Velocity Leadership (Muirhead and 
Simon, 1999), Lean Thinking (Womak and Jones, 1996) , or Blitz Projects (Shenhar, 1998a) to 
name a few.  Common to each of these management  strategies are characteristics such as 
empowerment, sense of mission, communication, customer involvement, breaking the rules, 
encouraging innovation, autonomy, and management invo lvement.  But, as previously mentioned, 
not all projects are the same, so how can projec ts be characterized, classified, and distinguished 
 
 2
and how should their management adapt to their specif ic attributes?  This work is devoted to 
these questions. 
 
2.  BACKGROUND 
 
Historically in the aerospace indus try, projects have been difficult, large ventures that inevitably 
carried high costs.  What resulted were ex pensive products, long development processes, 
complex management, the need for larger rockets , cost overruns that lengthened missions, and 
some troublesome failures (Kerr, 1994).  Theref ore, there have been concerted efforts within 
industry and government to try and understand the dev elopment of these large systems projects. 
 
In 1991, Robert Bless stated in his article “Space Science: What’s Wrong at  NASA” that the three 
areas that left NASA’s scientific programs less effe ctive and more costly were an over reliance on 
the Space Shuttle, a propensity for big projects, and poor management.   The increasing trend of 
launch delays and spacecraft redesigns that sp routed from the Space Shuttle Challenger 
accident resulted in larger and less frequent missi ons.  What resulted was what Greg Davidson 
(1993) described in his article “Our National S pace Science Program: Strategies to Maximize 
Science Return” as big versus small missions, mu ltiple simple spacecra ft versus servicing, a 
culture of risk avoidance, unrealistic budget planning,  institutional and political forces, and linkage 
to the manned space program.  
In 1992 a new initiative to address some of t hese issues was established at Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology (MIT) called the Lean Aeros pace Initiative (LAI).  LAI originated from 
developments by the Japanese aut omotive industry and the International Motor Vehicle 
Program’s (IMVP) effort to minimize waste and be responsive to change while focusing on value 
and flexibility (Murman, et al., 2000).  LAI was star ted through a consortium of leaders in the U.S. 
Air Force, MIT, labor unions, and defense businesses as a way of “significantly reducing the cost 
and cycle time for military aerospace products th roughout the entire value chain while continuing 
 
 3
to improve product performance” (Nightingale,  1998).  LAI’s mission is “to enable fundamental 
change within industry and government operations t hat supports the continuing transformation of 
the US aerospace enterprise towards providing aer ospace systems offering best life-cycle value” 
(Lean Aerospace Initiative, 1999).  The LAI effo rt of MIT has not been limited to the United 
States.  LAI has cooperative agreements with t he LAI of the UK and the Lean Aircraft Research 
Programme at the University of Linköping in Sweden. 
 Prior to the efforts of LAI, NASA was struggli ng with its own issues on how to manage its high-
tech programs and projects as a result of the tragic loss of the Space Shuttle Challenger January 
28, 1986.  In compliance with Executive Or der 12546 of February 3, 1986, NASA issued the 
Report of the Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident  (Rogers, 1986).  
In this report, the Rogers Commission identifi ed managerial deficiencies at NASA in management 
structure, key personnel in management, safety, crit ical reviews, and communication.  This report 
exposed many managerial issues within N ASA and prompted change throughout the agency.  
Some research suggests that the events leading up to the accident could have been the result of 
incorrect project management style (Shenhar, 1992). 
 The concerns of program and project management wi thin NASA were not first realized with the 
Space Shuttle Program.  In the late 1980’s the government also began to identify some of these 
issues.  The philosophy of “better, faster , cheaper” (BFC) was being fostered by the Reagan-
Bush Administration under the nourishment and cult ivation of the National Space Council (which 
no longer exists) as a way of reinventing the government and NASA.  In March 1992, when 
Daniel S. Goldin became the NASA administrator , NASA pushed, with the support of the Clinton 
Administration, for the adoption of “better, fa ster, cheaper” as the motto for a new and improved 
NASA.  On April 3, 1998, NASA issued a NASA Procedures and Guidelines document, Program 
and Project Management Processes and Requirements  (NPG 7120.5A), that described and 
defined NASA program/project management.  Although NPG 7120.5A defined NASA 
 
 4
program/project management procedures and guideli nes, it left a very open interpretation of 
exactly how NASA BFC management practices s hould be performed.  In November 1996, a 
special study group from the NASA Advanc ed Project Management training program (NASA 
APM-23) attempted to provide guidance to BFC pr ojects within the framework of NPG 7120.5A 
(NASA APM-23, 1996).  What resulted was a report entitled Fast Track Study .  This study 
brought changes to the development of NPG 7120.5A and how NPG 7120.5A applied to large 
projects with long life cycles.  In March 2000, NASA again attempted to define BFC when it formed the NASA Integrated Action 
Team (NIAT) to assess and develop recommendat ions for NASA programs and projects, as a 
result of the Mars Climate Orbiter Mishap Investigation  (Stephenson, 2000), Mars Program 
Independent Assessment  (Young, 2000), NASA Faster, Better, Cheaper Task  (Spear, 2000), and 
Shuttle Independent Assessment (McDonald, 2000).  This resulted in NIAT’s report, Enhancing 
Mission Success – Framework for the Future (Griner and Keegan, 2000) .  As a result of the 
NIAT’s recommendations, NASA revis ed NPG 7120.5A to produce NPD 7120.5B. 
 
More recently, the tragic loss of the Space Shuttle Columbia has forced NASA to take an even deeper look at how programs and projects ar e managed.  In August 2003, one of the most 
extensive and comprehensive invest igative reports ever preform ed by NASA was released: the 
Columbia Accident Investigation Board Report, Volume 1 (CAIB Report).  The CAIB Report 
detailed many of the organizational problems that  existed not only within the Space Shuttle 
Program but within NASA, and chronicled some  of these problems back to the Challenger 
accident.  The CAIB Report cited organizational i ssues associated with communication, culture, 
reliance on past success, redundancy, training, le sson learned, structure, decision making, 
internal and independent reviews, and safety.  NASA agai n is responding to this investigation with 
a planned release of revision C of NPD 7120.5.

These philosophies of managing high-tech projec ts have resulted in significant successes and 
costly failures. Although, companies are st ill demanding fast-paced, high-quality, low-cost 
products, and “doing more with less, faster” has  become an engrained philosophy (Boomer, et.al., 
2000).  The challenge is how a project can ac hieve innovation when developing systems under 
these kinds of constraints.  In a time of fa ster product development in less time, little has been 
learned or documented on how these concepts c an apply to the development of innovative 
systems.  In Leonard David’s article (1995)  “Better, faster, cheaper: Sloganeering or good 
engineering?,” he states that, “In the 1990’s faster, better, cheaper has become almost a mantra 
among top NASA, industry, and Pentagon official s, as well as project managers, space 
engineers, and university scientists.”  His article asks what is “better, faster, cheaper” engineering 
and the philosophy that surrounds it; can pr ojects be managed faster, better, and cheaper; and 
what kind of strategic project leadership is needed to support such a philosophy?  Despite the 
efforts of LAI, BFC, and the Space Shuttle accident responses, Murman, et al. (2000) state that it 
is still relatively early in the lean era and ther e are still many methods and tools to develop for 
improving the design, engineering, and manufactu ring phases of aerospace products.  With the 
challenges of innovating in the face of “better,  faster, cheaper,” the Space Shuttle accidents, and 
“lean aerospace,” project management still has much to learn to effectively manage these types 
of projects. 
 
3.  RESEARCH OBJECTIVES 
Classical distinctions in i nnovation state that there are three fundamental innovations: 
incremental, radical, and systems.  Of these,  incremental innovation has been studied the most, 
while systems innovation has been defined, but hardly studied.  Systems innovation is a change 
in technology with a specific process that is generational, unpredictable, and variable in space 
and time, and a product that is a complex collect ion of interactive elements, subsystems, and 
systems that function together to  achieve a common purpose.  The purpose of this study was to 
develop a better understanding of the management of strategic system projects (and programs) 
 
 6
at NASA, and in particular, what makes such projects  successful or not in an era of “better, faster, 
cheaper.”  This investigation looked at how t he theories of Strategic Project Leadership (SPL) 
could define the factors of success or failure of  a systems innovation project (Shenhar, 2000).  To 
accomplish this, case study research evaluated the theories of SPL and how they applied to BFC 
projects, a type of systems innov ation.  The objectives were to (1) develop a better conceptual 
understanding of strategic system innovation through the study  of BFC projects, (2) understand 
how SPL can describe BFC projects, and (3) provide feedback, recommendations and lessons 
learned to NASA and the aerospace industry on pot ential success criteria for BFC projects. 
 
4.  THEORETICAL BACKGROUND 
4.1  Systems Theory At some level, all projects can be described as a system by the interconnection of their 
components (budgets, schedules, team s, managers, customers, etc. ), but how these components 
come together and work as a system while achiev ing innovation is not always understood.  First, 
we need to establish a basic understanding of what a system is, the primary unit of analysis of 
this investigation, to even begin to understand sy stems and how they are managed.  A system is 
two or more subordinate entities that interact in some fashion to accomplish a process that 
transforms a set of predetermined inputs into a set of desired outputs, in time achieving a 
predetermined goal (Leach, 2000; Grandy, 2000).  By  this very definition, one can understand 
through deductive reasoning that the optimum fo r any one component of a system is not the 
optimum for the system. 
 
Because this investigation examined system s projects and how they are managed, it was 
fundamental to use General Systems Theory (G ST) as the foundation for the theoretical 
development; therefore, a fundam ental understanding of GST is im perative to set the groundwork 
for the theoretical development.  GST was proposed by Ludwig von Bertalanffy in the 1940s and 
published in his book General Systems Theory  in 1968.  GST is the transdisciplinary study of the 
 
 7
abstract organization of phenomena, independent of their substance, type, or spatial or temporal 
scale of existence, while in a continual atte mpt to develop integrated phenomena of study in any 
of a number of different disciplines (Ruben and Kim, 1975).  GST is based on eight fundamental 
concepts that underlie all system s and provide a basis for unifica tion: (1) system-environment 
boundary, (2) input, (3) output, (4) process, (5) stat e, (6) hierarchy, (7) goal-directedness, and (8) 
information (von Bertalanffy, 1968). 
 These eight fundamental concepts are linked by four basic assumptions: 
1. The sum is greater than the parts and there are consequences for not understanding the 
dynamics of each part. 
2. There is multilateral causality among s ubsystems, systems, and the environments they 
function in. 
3. One set of initial conditions can gi ve rise to different final states. 
4. There is concern with the flow of in formation between subsystems (components) (Ruben 
and Kim, 1975).  
 
Ashby’s development of GST stat es that a system has a self -organizing process where the 
organization of a system spontaneously increases with a decrease in statistical entropy and an 
increase in redundancy, information, and cons traints (Ashby, 1956).  Later in 1956, in Introduction 
to Cybernetics , Ashby explained that most systems are in a state of disequilibria and, as the 
systems progress, they make select ions that will bring them closer  to equilibrium.  This is what 
some have called “organized complexity.”  GST a sserts that a system begins in a condition of 
uncertainty and complexity and moves to a more cert ain state over time as conditions progress.  
The evolution of GST from von Bertalanffy in  the 1940s has seen the fundamental concepts of 
GST applied to many areas and brought about  new disciplines and phenomena: systems 
engineering, systems design, sy stems analysis, systems approac h, cybernetics, and systems 
science to name a few (Brill, 1998).  Because the t heory of systems is still evolving, there is still 
 
 8
not widespread use of GST within industry (She ll, 2001).  Even though GST has evolved from the 
1940s and has developed more rapidly in the last 10 years, it is not truly defined in project 
management of systems projects.  The most complex projects that have been or will be 
developed are of systems to solve complex engi neering problems.  More recently Shenhar 
(2001a) defined systems based on a hierarchy of sy stem scope: assemble, system, or array.  
System scope is defined by the way a project is organized, its scope, and the interconnection 
between project elements.  This investigati on used Shenhar’s hierarchy to define systems 
development.  
4.2  Systems Engineering 
The attempt to understand the lifecycle of m odern systems has been through the engineering of 
systems or systems engi neering.  Systems engineering (SE) is “the management technology that 
controls a total lifecycle proce ss, which involves and which result s in the definition, development, 
and deployment of a system that is  of high quality, trustworthy, and cost effective in meeting user 
needs” (Sage, 1995; Sage and Rouse, 1999a).  SE provi des a process by which the organization, 
application, and delivery of systems can be managed, also called systems engineering 
management (Shenhar, 1999a).  A key success driver  in SE is the process by which the 
integration of people, processes, problem-sol ving mechanisms, and information come together, 
commonly called concurrent engineering (Kusiak and Larson, 1999).  SE was first termed in the 
1940s by Bell Laboratories and has been defined and documented ever since by various 
institutions in a multitude of documents.  In 1962 Arthur Hall theorized three fundamental 
elements of SE: (1) SE is multifaceted; (2) SE has  three distinct divisions: (a) the physical or 
technical, (b) the business or economic, and (c) the social; and (3) SE considers the needs of its 
customers and determines how the needs can best be met in light of all knowledge, both old and 
new (Hall, 1962).  Historically, principles of SE have largely been utilized and developed in the 
government with projects such as manned space flight, nuclear-powered submarines, 
communications satellites, launch vehicles, airc raft, and deep-space probes.  It is projects such 
 
 9
as these in the aerospace/defense industry that carry characterist ics like high complexity of the 
system with high technological risk, extreme desi gn constraints, desire for complete answers, and 
auditability (Parth, 1998).  Even within SE there ar e different types of projects that can be 
characterized by various management styles and prac tices.  One of these characterizations is 
Large Systems Projects (LSP).  
4.3  Large Systems Projects 
LSPs carry a high level of complexity, unc ertainty, and reliance on an understanding of the 
fundamental concepts of system s and can begin to define BFC pr ojects.  LSPs consist of 
customized, interconnected subsystems, carry high cost, are designed for one customer, are 
produced in low volume, require broad and deep knowledge and skills, engage multiple 
collaborators, involve the customer and supp liers throughout the life cycle, and have strong 
political considerations (Floricel and Miller, 2001; Miller and Lessard, 2000).  LSPs tend to have 
life cycles that stay in the fl uid phase of product innovation (Dav ies and Brady, 1998).    Examples 
of LSPs are the Space Shuttle, the B-2 “St ealth” Bomber, the NY/NJ Mass Transit System, and 
the Hubble Space Telescope.  To understand LSPs we can distinguish them by so me of the following characteristics (Hobday, et 
al., 2000; Miller and Lessard, 2000; Nightingale, 1998; Shenhar, 1998b):
 
 Consist of customized, interconnected element s with subsystems that are complex and 
customized and that carry high costs. 
 Develop financial difficulties. 
 Exhibit emergent properties during production. 
 Allow for a high degree of direct-user involvement. 
 Experience frequent requirement changes during the life cycle. 
 Involve a prime contractor, systems integr ators, technical personnel, and administrative 
staff. 
 
 10
 Products are never mass produced. 
 Carry high levels of uncertainty. 
 Can extend over decades. 
 Lead to innovation long after the delivery of the product.  
 Require a wide range of activities and functions to address an operational need.  
 Require implementation of training, test  equipment, maintenance equipment, logistic 
support, spares parts, and gr eat deal of documentation.  
 Tend to be regulated and bureaucratic with  strong political considerations.  
 Develop environmental concerns.  
The literature has identified numerous difficultie s associated with the development of LSPs (Sage 
and Rouse, 1999c; Hansen and Rush, 1998): 
 Difficult to identify and capture user requirements. 
 Expensive. 
 Capabilities are often less then promised and expected. 
 Deliveries are often late. 
 Cost overruns often occur. 
 Documentation is inappropriate and inadequate. 
 Maintenance is complex and error prone. 
 Unanticipated risks and hazards. 
 May be no provision for risk management. 
 Suffer in terms of reliability, maintainability, and availability. 
 Often do not perform according to specifications. 
 Difficult to identify suitable performance metr ics that enable determinat ion of system cost 
and effectiveness. 
 Poor communication among program management, designers, and customers or 
program sponsors. 
 Specifications do not always c apture user needs and requirements. 
 
 11
 Technical uncertainty and difficulties. 
 Dependence upon suppliers and difficultie s with procurement systems. 
 
The knowledge base of LSPs is limited in the ar ea of systems innovati on and only recently has 
this area been largely recognized and investigated.   There is limited theory on how LSPs develop 
and are managed.  This has become even more impor tant as there has been increasing attention 
on LSPs in the economic activities of firms,  industries, and nations (Hansen and Rush, 1998).  
Innovation in LSPs differs notably from sma ller, mass-produced projects and thus requires 
different management techniques (Hobday, 1998).  “Many  of the current problems in the delivery 
of acceptable (or even usable) large, complex, sy stems solutions result from a failure to apply a 
rigorous systems-science approach” (Shell, 2001).  Hobday, Rush, and Tidd (2000) state 
conventional innovation wisdom is derived from  research on high volume consumer products; 
new evidence, models, and concepts are needed to  properly understand the innovation process 
in complex products and systems.  Even in 1987,  Morris and Hough stated t hat “the application of 
conventional systems development  for ordinary projects have been found to be inappropriate for 
complex projects.”  There is still much advanc ement that must occur before we have an adequate 
understanding of systems i nnovation (Amara, 1990). 
 
4.4  Contingency Theory – Different Project Characteristics 
Contingency theory states that an organizati on’s effectiveness is dependant upon its ability to 
adjust or adapt to environmental uncertainty (e xternal conditions).  As uncertainty in 
environmental conditions increases, the need fo r integration or congruency among variables 
increases.  As environmental uncer tainties increase, a project mu st begin to function more as a 
system (Darzin and van de Ven,  1985; Souder, et al. 1998).   
 
Shenhar (2001a) theorizes that projec ts carry a level of uncertainty  which increases with a level 
of technological uncertainty, or as this investigation is propos ing, moving toward a higher degree 
 
 12
of systems innovation.  Fundamental to this investi gation is that BFC projects carry a greater level 
of uncertainty than most projects.  In organiza tions, events, situations, or technology can be 
described with a level of certainty or uncer tainty.  Certainty can be planned for (routine), 
structurally managed (bureaucracy ), and predicted.  Uncertaint y means that people have to 
adjust and be flexible to unpredictable occurrences.  Uncertainty is more common than certainty, 
and it is nonlinear (Eisenhardt and Brown, 1998).  The field of project management has only 
recently recognized that managing uncertainty is critical to project success.  Even the Project 
Management Body Of Knowledge (PMBOK) di d not recognize risk management until 1986. 
Others, like Laufer (1998), have described proj ects by managing the uncertainty.  Senge’s Fifth 
Discipline , states that “to change the behavior of a system, you must identify and change the 
limiting factor”—the uncertainty (Senge, 1994).  The failure of all project systems can be linked to 
a failure to manage uncertainty (Leach, 2000).   
 
Pender (2001) states that traditional projec t management is based on probability theory, which 
assumes there is knowledge of probable future states, rationality, fr ictionless transactions, 
random events, repeatability, comparability, and goal optimization.  Accepting uncertainty as part 
of a project is to accept a nontraditional paradigm that is more representative of reality or the 
natural state of things.  Discrete random event s can be predicted and planned (e.g. the flip of a 
coin), while human actions tend not to be random.  Uncertainty is risk with variability in future 
events, and risk is the ability to predict the future  based on incomplete information with a level of 
chance (Knight, 1921).  Therefore, the fundament al difference in risk and uncertainty is 
knowledge of the past and an ability to define the fu ture.  This investigation will distinguish 
between risk and uncertainty where risk is defined as  factors that can be described by statistical 
terms and uncertainty as factors where potentia l outcomes and casual forces are not fully 
understood (Miller and Lessard, 2001).    
 
 
 13
Milliken (1987) theorized that there are three kinds of uncertainty: environmental state 
uncertainty, organizational effect uncertainty, and decision response uncertainty.  These theories 
indicate that uncertainty would exist within and among systems.  It is also clear that different 
types of uncertainty exist in  all phases and areas of a project (Miller and Shamsie, 1999; Song 
and Montoya-Weiss, 2001).  Within the literature, numerous, mo re specific types  of uncertainty 
are cited: technological uncertainty, customer uncertainty, competitor uncertainty, and market 
uncertainty to name a few.  Song and Montoya -Weiss (2001) suggest that uncertainty should be 
studied in relation to specific components in order to properly attribute its effects.  Eisenhardt and 
Tabrizi (1995) stated that product development is a very uncertain path as well, with 
unpredictable shifts in events and technologies.  Systems are inherently risky and carry a great 
level of uncertainty.  What is true about today’s  systems is there is increasing uncertainty and 
thus they are prone to sudden unexpected changes.  The process of systems innovation moves 
from an initial, ill-defined conception of a problem , through a series of subproblems, to a finished 
technology (Nightingale, 1998).  In organizational behav ior, this could be referred to as “storming 
and norming” (Greensberg and Baron, 1997).  Laufer (1997) refers to this as 
diverging/converging.  Some have even tried to ex plain uncertainty through chaos theory.  Glass’ 
chaos theory (1996) explains that most organizations  believe there is a state of equilibrium that 
management tries to balance around.  Fundamental to  Glass’ theories and chaos theory is that 
the environment is not inherently  stable and there is a fine balanc e that produces order from 
disorder.  This becomes a balance on the edge of c haos while letting a certain level of disorder 
bring order and direction.  Brown and Eisenhardt (1998) refer to chaos theory in management as 
structured chaos  (figuring out what to structure and not  to structure, both on an organizational 
level and a managerial level). 
 Shenhar has worked toward the development of a theory to address the strategic, operational, 
and human issues of systems innov ation and add strategic direction to a project.  He theorizes 
that not all projects are the same and t hus they should not be managed the same (Shenhar, 
 
 14
2001a).  He has proposed a typology based on an el emental foundation in contingency theory for 
managing different types of projects (e.g. system s projects), called Strategic Project Leadership 
(SPL).   
 
4.5  Strategic Project Leadership 
SPL is an integrated, formal, strategically focused approach to project management to address 
the human issues of systems i nnovation.  Its has a foundation built upon the research of the 
National Science Foundation Grant, Strategic Project Management: Making Projects Our Next 
Competitive Weapon  (Shenhar, Merino, and Reilly, March 1998), and it theorizes a framework for 
project managers for the planning and execut ion phases of a project (Shenhar, 2000).  
Fundamental to SPL is that “one size does not fit all projects.”  SPL focuses on the effectiveness 
and efficiency of a project while maintaining a perspective on strategy, operation, and the human 
factor.  While traditional project management stresses getting the job done on time and within 
budget, SPL focuses on the product, scope, and strategy  to strategically position a project to be 
successful.   This is accomplished by stressing the human side of project leadership.  SPL is 
based on seven principles that are designed to  help organizations implement a strategic 
approach (Shenhar, 2004):  1. Leadership : Project managers must become leaders and be held responsible for business 
results.  They have to be accountable for the project’s direction and plan, for the vision and 
execution, and for doing the right things right.  
2. Strategic Project Portfolio Management : Projects should be grouped based on their 
strategic impact and form a policy for project se lection.  Portfolio management identifies two 
dimensions to determine the st rategic impact of projects: 
a. Strategic Goal Dimension , which includes: 
 
 15
(1) Operational Projects : Projects that deal with existing business, 
improvements in products, and line extensions. 
(2) Strategic Projects: Projects that  deal with new business made to create 
or sustain strategic position. 
b. Customer Dimension , which involves: 
(1) External Customer: For exte rnal customers—contracted or 
noncontracted. 
(2) Internal Customers: Within the organization, doing work for other 
departments or units. 
 
3. Project Strategy : Projects have to define the co mpetitive advantage of the product and 
articulate a detailed project strategy to win in  the market place.  While project plans include 
decisions about activities, resource s, timelines, and deliverables, stra tegy is what should drive the 
plan.  Shenhar specifies that Projec t Strategy involves six elements: 
a. Objectives : Defines the market, the cust omers, the need, the business 
opportunity, and how the opportunities will be addressed. 
b. Product Definition :  What is the product and what will it do? 
c. Competitive Advantage : Why will the customer want this product? 
d. Business Perspective : The business plans and expected results on several 
success dimensions (Shenhar, et al., 2002). 
e. Project Definition : The scope, project type, project manager, team, and time and 
budget projections. 
f. Strategic Focus : The policy, the behavior, and the desired processes, which 
when followed, will create t he best competitive advantage. 
 
 
 16
4. Project Spirit : Project managers must articulate an inspiring project vision and develop an 
appropriate project spirit, wh ich will support the strategy and create energy, excitement, and 
commitment.  Spirit is further defined by: 
a. Product Vision : Describes the feelings that will be present when a project is 
completed and its future impact and value. 
b. Project Individual Culture : A unique culture is created and it is nurtured by a set 
of values that are demonstrated and practiced by the project manager. 
 
5. Adaptation :  Assessing the environment and the task,  a project is classified on four 
dimensions and the right project management style to fit to the project type.  Shenhar states that 
projects carry contingencies based on the four di mensions of novelty, complexity, technology, 
and pace (Shenhar, 1998b; Shenhar and Dvir, 2004), the NCTP Model: 
a. Novelty:  Defined by the products uniqueness to the market and existing 
technology, and impact on the project definit ion and market-related activities.  To 
categorize product novelty, Shenhar us es Wheelwright and Clark’s (1992) 
definition of new product development: der ivative, platform, and breakthrough. 
b. Complexity : Defined by the way a project is organized, its scope, and the 
interconnections among project elements.  As the complexity of a project 
increases thus does the project size, ex tent and detail of planning, coordination, 
documentation, and bureaucracy.  Shenhar cla ssifies project complexity or scope 
as assembly, system, and array. 
c. Technology : Defined as the uncertainty cent ered on a technology’s development, 
maturity, and knowledge.  As technical unc ertainty increases, so do requirements 
for technical and professional skills, development efforts and time to completion, communication, and the impact and signific ance of project results.  Shenhar 
classifies projects on technical uncertain ty as low-tech, medium-tech, high-tech, 
and super-high-tech.  As both technologica l uncertainty and system complexity 
 
 17
increase, so do the employment of sy stems engineering techniques, problems of 
systems integration, and the employment of conf iguration management and risk 
management techniques (Shenhar, 2001b). 
d. Pace : Defined by the urgency and criticality of time goals for a project.  Time 
constraints on a project can dictate va rying project structures and management 
attention.  Shenhar classifies a projects  pace as regular, fa st/competitive, or 
blitz/critical. 
 
Once a project is classified based on these four di mensions, it defines cert ain characteristics of 
that project that make it unique in how it is  managed.  Figure 1 shows that connecting the NCTP 
classification with a straight line to form a di amond, gives a representation of the level of risk 
associated with a project.  The greater the area of the diamond, the great er the degree of risk.  
While there is not a linear relationship between the area of the diamond for correct and incorrect 
project risk, it can represent a difference in the degree of risk.

6. Integration : A project must create an integrated hierarch ical plan. Shenhar states that this plan 
should be built on five hierarchical elements t hat he calls the SPL Style: strategy, spirit, 
organization, processes, and tools. 
a. Strategy : The project perspective, directi on, and guidelines on what to do and 
how to do it, to achieve the highest competitive advantage and the best project 
results. 
b. Spirit : Defining and nurturing the vision that energizes and brings out the best in 
people.  How the team is empowered to make decisions and implement them.  What style management uses, and who is def ined or viewed as the leadership of 
the organization.   
c. Organization : How the people within the project are structured, report, 
collaborate, deal with difficulties, rece ive advice and reviews, and are trained.  
Who is defined as top-level management, how they are involved, how they 
assembled the team, how much authorit y they have over the project, and how 
they assign work.   
d. Processes : A project's phases and review pr ocesses, communication, project 
monitoring, planning, and control. 
e. Tools : Serve to help plan, execute, and cont rol the project.  What form, means, 
and frequency of communication are used? 
7. Learning : A project should create a project lear ning organization.  Every monitoring and 
controlling activity should include lessons learned that are summarized in a lessons learned event 
and report. 
 
Shenhar theorized that most projects are operationally managed inst ead of strategically 
managed.  A strategically managed project as apposed to an operationally managed project has 
the flexibility to adjust to various  project characteristics (e.g. size, scope, uncertainty), thus 
allowing for the “one size does not fit all proj ects” theory.  O’Connor (1998) adds to Shenhar’s 
 
 19
philosophy that academics “have not focused att ention on the possibility that what may be sound 
management practice for the development of incr emental improvements may well be detrimental 
to the development of discont inuous, breakthrough innovation.” 
 
4.6  Summary 
Figure 2 represents the evoluti onary theoretical foundation that  BFC projects will be defined 
upon.  GST proposes a way to see the world and how systems progress and interact.  The 
evolution of GST has lead to the typology of many  different classifications of systems.  With 
significant influence from systems engineering and innovation theory, one of the classifications 
that has evolved is Systems Innovation.  Using Shenhar’s SPL , this investigation develops 
integrated, formal, strategically focused approaches to be used by NASA project management 
while stressing the human side of projec t management for systems innovation. 
 
There are also theoretical conjectures that link the proposed theories with the characteristics of 
systems innovation projects: 
• They are dynamic and change is normal. 
• They are influenced by external event s that are dynamic and unpredictable. 
• They have multiple stakeholders. 
• No two systems or projects are the same. 
• Knowledge of the past and future is limited and thus decisions are reliant on self-
reflection (heuristics) and comparison.

5.  RESEARCH PLAN 
5.1  Objectives 
1. Develop a better conceptual understanding of  system innovation through the study of 
BFC projects. 
2. Understand how SPL can be applied to BFC projects. 
3. Provide feedback, recommendations, and lessons learned to NASA and the aerospace 
industry on potential success criteria for BFC projects. 
 
5.2  Research Design 
For this investigation, a case study analysis wa s used, guided by theoretic al proposition.  After 
the completion of each case study, a within-case analysis was performed to gain familiarity with 
the data and evaluate the theories.  The study of the next case wa s started before the previous 
ended; therefore, an overlap of  the data collection and analysis strengthened the analysis and 
helped reveal any adjustments that needed to be made to the data collection methods.  Once the 
case studies were developed for all of the projec ts, a cross-project analysis was preformed to 
determine patterns and anomalies.  Once this was performed, the analysis was completed when only small marginal improvements could be made to the theoretical validation. 
 
5.2.1  Research Question 
How and why can system innovation projects in the aerospace industry achieve successful 
results under demands of leaner, be tter, faster, and cheaper products? 
 
5.2.2  Hypotheses 
1. NASA projects require a unique model  or framework for project management. 
2. SPL provides a fundamental framewor k for analyzing, planning, and managing NASA 
projects. 
 
 
 22
5.2.3  Threats to Validity 
Yin (1994) identifies three factors that are often overlooked when performing case study 
research: (1) bias, (2) little basis for scientif ic generalization, and (3) result in massive, 
unreadable documents.  Each of these factor s can be eliminated with awareness of the 
fundamental threats to validity.  These threat s will be addressed with the following precautions: 
1. Construct Validity :  (1) multiple sources of evidence, (2) establishing a chain of evidence, 
and (3) periodic review of research stra tegy, concepts, and analysis of data by 
colleagues.   
2. Internal Validity :  For the purposes of this study, inte rnal validity was viewed with respect 
to inferences that could be made within the study.  To overcome this, all evidence was 
viewed with respect to whether the infer ence was correct and the possibility of other 
explanations.   
3. External Validity :  Multiple-case studies were perform ed.  Four projects were selected 
that represent two successes and two failures in  BFC projects.   With the knowledge that 
they apply to a specified sample, and cannot  be generalized to a population, the goals of 
expanding theory and formulating truth were kept in perspective. 
4. Reliability :  A study protocol was established for fu ture replication and to reduce any bias 
in the collection of data.  In addition, a case study database was developed that would 
allow for the formatting of data archiving.  
 
5.3  Methodology This research evaluated theories around the how and why of BFC projects that were trying to 
achieve systems innovation in a time of l eaner, faster, better, and cheaper.  A case study 
research methodology was chosen because it allowed for the characterization of real-life events, 
such as organizational and managerial processes, and there was no requirement for control over 
behavioral events, thus allowing for the capt ure of holistic and significant experiences 
(Eisenhardt, 1989; Gillham, 2000; Yin, 1998).  Eisenhar dt (1989) states in “Building Theory from 
 
 23
Case Study Research” that case studies can prov ide description, test theory, or generate theory.  
She describes a fundamental difference in case study research as compared to experimental 
research is in the selection of the sample popul ation.  Cases are chosen for theoretical reasons, 
not statistical reasons.  One of the reasons for this, and why case study research was chosen for 
this investigation, was to extend emerging theor y, in this case SPL.  Case study research 
provides a conduit to go from theory to data and back to theory.  To describe the cases and 
provide a protocol for data collection Shenhar’s (1999b)  “Real Life Project A nalysis – Guidelines,” 
Shenhar and Dvir’s (2004) “How Pr ojects Differ and What to Do  About It?,” and Shenhar (2004) 
“Strategic Project Leadership: Toward A Strategi c Approach to Project Management” were used.  
Four cases that represented two failures and tw o successes in BFC projects were chosen. 
 The mode of analysis for this project was a modifi ed Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT) for case 
study research (Scholz and Tietje, 2002).  MAUT wa s used to attain a systematic measure of the 
attractiveness of each outcome of a set of attr ibutes (e.g. SPL).  This method works best when 
evaluating alternatives to determine which perfo rms best.  MAUT allows comparison among what 
people do, what people intend to do, and what they  should do.  For this research, MAUT was 
used to evaluate SPL and describe the processes and structure of SPL and how it applied to BFC 
projects.  
The analysis followed the following steps: 
1. Analysis of the decision situation : This involves the definition of the cases to be 
evaluated, the framework in which the cases we re described, and the possible alternatives and 
their consequences.  The cases were defined as pr ojects that represented a maturation of BFC 
with the following attributes: 
a. Tasked to be completed under a BFC management style. 
b. LSPs. 
c. Government or industry aerospace development project. 
 
 24
d. Prime contractor is based in the United States. 
e. Projects were completed in the last 12 years. 
f. Project life cycle made it through launch. 
The framework for collection and formulation of the data was with Shenhar’s “Real Life Project 
Analysis – Guidelines,” and the possible alte rnatives and the consequences were defined by 
Shenhar and Dvir’s (2004) “How Projects  Differ and What to Do About It?”  and Shenhar’s 
(2004) “Strategic Project Leadership: Toward A Strategic Approach to Project Management.” 
 2. Inquiry of existing evaluation structures :  This defines the techniques for data collection.  
Data collection was performed using the following sources of evidence: 
a. Interviews : Project team members were approached through e-mail or telephone via 
personal contact or through a colleague.    Each potential interviewee was provided 
with a one-page letter of introduction that included a statement of  the dissertation 
project, purpose/rational, and people c onducting and sponsoring the study, and 
background on SPL.  Interviews were conducted in a semistructured, open-ended 
conversational format to allow intervie wees to speak freely and openly about their 
experiences.   Interviews ranged fr om 30 minutes to 2 hours based on the 
interviewee’s availability and depth of info rmation.  A single interview session was 
performed with each subject, with follow- up interviews on an as-needed basis.  Each 
interview included identification of the inte rviewers and the interviewee, including a 
list of the interviewee’s position, role in  the project, when he/she was involved, length 
of the interview, and information on how  he/she could be contacted for more 
questions (address, phone, and e-mail).   At least five key personnel related to each 
project were interviewed.  These peopl e represented program management, project 
management, administration, team member, and customer.  Each interview was 
recorded on audiotape and transcribed. 
 
 25
b. Documentation  (related to the project, but not a product of the parent organization) :  
Formal studies, evaluations, journal articl es, survey data, mass media, and physical 
artifacts (samples of work done). 
c. Archival and Historical Information  (directly related to a product of the project or 
parent organization) : Letters, memoranda, policy stat ements, regulations, proposals, 
guidelines, procedures, summary reports , organizational records, and personal 
records.  
d. Participant Observation :  NASA gave permission for participation in its Academy of 
Program and Project Leadership training programs.  This included project 
management training classes. 
 3. The alternatives-versus-attributes matrix :  Attributes are defined as preference-related 
dimensions of a system, or variables.  Attribut es characterize and describe a project, with each 
attribute having a set of alternatives.  Alternat ives define and describe t he attractiveness of the 
attributes for a case.  Once a case study wa s completed, an alternatives-versus-attributes 
matrix was used to evaluate the project.  For this  research, the alternatives and attributes were 
defined by Shenhar and Dvir’s (2004) “How Proj ects Differ and What to Do About It?” and 
Shenhar (2004) “Strategic Project Leadership: To ward A Strategic Approach to Project 
Management.”  For example, an attribute in SPL would be Technology and the alternatives 
would be Low-Tech, Medium-Tech, High-Tech, and Super High-Tech.  
4. Utility functions : Utility functions serve as a measure of  the attractiveness of an alternative 
with respect to its attributes; are a measure t hat makes attributes comparable; and reflect the 
values or intentions of an individual, group, or  organization.  For this research, the utility 
functions were defined by Shenhar and Dvir’s ( 2004) “How Projects Differ and What to Do 
About It?,”  Shenhar (2004)’s “Strategic Project Leadersh ip: Toward A Strategic Approach to 
 
 26
Project Management,” and the case studies as defi ned by Shenhar’s “Real Life Project Analysis 
– Guidelines.”  
 
5. Evaluation and discussion :  Once all the cases were analyzed, a final iteration was 
performed to develop and refine a final theoretic al statement about the findings.  This was 
defined as the evaluation and discussion.  Eval uation and discussion describes the results of 
the evaluation of each case, provides a cro ss-case analysis, and offers recommendations for 
the management of BFC projects.

6.  CROSS-CASE ANALYSIS 
This study investigated four NASA BFC projects  that represented a maturation of BFC and its 
success and failure (two successes: Mars Pathfinder and Lunar Prospector; two failures: CONTOUR and Mars Climate Orbiter).  Therefore, BFC is defined in the context of the physical 
constraints of deep-space missions and all results are described based on the cases 
investigated.  The following is a cross-case analys is of the four projects investigated as defined 
by the five elements of planning with Strategic Project Leadership (SPL) and the seven principles 
of SPL: (1) Leadership; (2) Strategic Project Po rtfolio Management; (3) Project Strategy; (4) 
Project Spirit; (5) Adaptation; (6) Integration;  and (7) Learning.  The analysis will focus on the 
elements and principles of SPL that could expl ain and interpret the case investigations for 
verifying the hypotheses.  Where the cross-ca se analysis could not provide significant 
explanation to formulate conclusive results to ve rify or falsify the hypotheses, the SPL variables 
are not discussed.    
6.1  Case Summaries 
6.1.1  Mars Pathfinder 
 
In 1993, Congress approved a plan proposed by NASA’ s Space Science Enterprise for better, 
faster, cheaper planetary missions called the Discovery  Program.  To show Congress that it could 
be done, NASA selected two charter missions: one at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and 
one at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Ph ysics Laboratory (APL).  Mars Pathfinder was 
chosen at JPL as a scientific mission set out to broaden the understanding of Mars and show that 
BFC could be done successfully.   
 
As a product, Mars Pathfinder was a single v ehicle (lander), with microrover and several 
instruments designed to demonstrate a low-cost system for cruise, entry, descent, and landing on 
Mars.  Additional objectives included the depl oyment and operation of various scientific 
 
 31
instruments: stereoscopic imager  with filters on a pop-up mast, alpha proton x-ray spectrometer 
(APXS), and atmospheric structure instrument/meteorology package. 
 
As a project, Mars Pathfinder, at the time one of the most complex planetary exploration projects 
in space science history, was to design, tes t, and develop a lander and rover to launch and safely 
land on the surface of Mars.  With 3 years fo r development and a total cost no greater than $280 
million (including the launch vehicle and mission oper ations), Mars Pathfinder was to demonstrate 
a simple, low-cost system, at a fixed price for placing a science payload on the surface of Mars at 
1/15 the cost of Viking (Viking cost $2.8 b illion in 1997 dollars).  Mars Pathfinder was a 
breakthrough product that introduced to the worl d a new way of landing on Mars, and what was 
more significant, a robotic rover to traverse the planet.  As a system of a complex collection of 
interactive elements and subsystems, it functi oned as one unit to meet its operational needs.  
While most of the technology to accomplish th is was commercial off-the-shelf, a significant 
portion of the technology was new to planetary ex ploration and made it a high-tech project.  As 
with most deep space projects, schedule, cos t, and technology have limited margins, making 
Mars Pathfinder a blitz- critical project.   
 On July 4, 1997, Americans watched the first pi ctures come back from Mars, marking one of 
NASA’s most celebrated, historic, and accomp lished days.  A whole new generation was being 
introduced to the Red Planet through television and the Internet, as Mars  Pathfinder shattered 
records for web site hits, peaking at 1 million in a day.  From its start, Mars Pathfinder had project 
constraints that were unmatched by another NASA project and science objectives that would 
return an unparalleled amount of data to the la rgest science community associated with a NASA 
mission.  For all of Mars Pathfinder’s interest  and success, it was not the landing on Mars that 
marked its success (Viking I and II accomplished this in 1976 and 1978 respectively)—it was the 
means by which it was accomplished that m ade it unique, innovative, and electrifying.  
 
 
 32
To be successful, the Mars Pathfinder team had to do business differently from traditional and 
standard operating procedures.  They worked to  develop a unique culture centered on leaner 
staff, reduced overhead, empowered team members,  a willingness to do things in new ways, and 
a management team that believed in a team of c apable, self-directed members.  To build this 
cultural rules were lifted and author itative structures were minimi zed.  The team was hand-picked, 
with many being experts in their fields, but most of all, these people had to be generalist and 
multidisciplined.  These people were picked from a skill set of different ages and experiences, but 
all brought with them a level of energy and creativ ity to carry the project from beginning to end.  
The leadership was committed to the project goal s of launching a spacecraft that was better, 
faster and cheaper and all actions were in line with  these goals.  This meant having a clear vision 
and making sure that that vision was part of ever y action.  Mars Pathfinder was successful at 
being completed on time, on budget, and met first line project objectives, and management 
valued the people that they empowered every day.  A more detailed description and analysis of 
Mars Pathfinder based on SPL can be found in Appendix A.  
6.1.2  Lunar Prospector 
 
Lunar Prospector was the first competitively se lected mission in the NASA Discovery Program, 
developed to produce frequent, low-cost missions to explore the solar system.  Lunar Prospector 
was a spin-stabilized spacecraft designed to map the surface composition and magnetic field of 
the Moon and begin investigating some of the 80 percent of the Moon’s surface features, 
structure, and composition not  investigated during Apollo. 
 
As a product, Lunar Prospector was a single vehicle (orbiter) and several instruments designed to 
demonstrate a low cost system for orbiting the Moon and expanding our scientific knowledge of it.  
Additional objectives included the deployment and oper ation of various scientific instruments: 
neutron spectrometer, gamma ray spectrometer, magnetometer/ele ctron reflectometer, doppler 
gravity experiment, and alpha particle spectrometer.  While much of the technology was known, 
 
 33
its application and what Lunar Prospector was planned to accomplish made it different than 
anything that had been done before.  
 
As a project, Lunar Prospector was to design, test, and develop an orbiter that would obtain 
scientific data and demonstrate, as the first com petitively selected Discovery Program mission, 
the philosophy of “better, faster, cheaper.”  Lunar  Prospector had a development time of almost 3 
years and a project cost that included development  ($34 million), launch vehicle ($25 million), and 
operations ($4 million), for a total of $63 million.   Lunar Prospector involved 75 to 100 people from 
Ames Research Center, Goddard Space Flight C enter, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, University of 
California – Berkley, University of Arizona, Lockheed-Martin, Lunar Research Institute (Alan 
Binder, principal investigator, left Lockheed Martin to establish the Lunar Research Institute), and 
Los Alamos National Laboratory.  Lunar Prospector was a high-tech project.  Much of the 
technology was proven from previous spac ecraft but had not been incorporated in this 
configuration.  Lunar Prospector was a comp lex collection of interactive elements and 
subsystems developed to perform a wide range of functions under extreme conditions.  The pace 
development was a blitz-critical.  While many of  the characteristics of such deep-space-mission 
projects point to a fast pass, it is the infl exible launch date that moves deep space missions like 
Lunar Prospector into a blitz-critic al mode.  In addition, termination of the project was directly 
related to any significant deviation in schedule and budget margins 
 
Lunar Prospector ended on July 31, 1999, when the s pacecraft was jettisoned into a crater near 
the south pole of the Moon as part of an experiment to confirm the existence of water ice.  The 
mission ran for 19 months and successfully complet ed all of its objectives. The data collected has 
allowed for the construction of a detailed map of  the surface composition of the Moon, and the 
information gathered was far more comp rehensive than any data ever collected. 
 
 
 34
Lunar Prospector was successful because t he management team understood well before the 
project started that simplicity would be the ke y to project success.  Lunar Prospector was well 
defined with a clear understanding of the scope, technical uncertainty, and pace.  This guided 
management toward design constraints that kept Lunar Prospector on budget and on schedule. 
Lunar Prospector management determined their strat egy early with customer-defined objectives 
that were simple, attainable, and valuable.  A focused, unspoken, and common commitment from 
a collocated team laid a foundation for limit ed top-management involvement and a dedication of 
staff from project start to finish.  The Lunar Prospector team understood the value of informal and 
formal reviews, how they related to w hen to freeze designs, and how they impacted 
requirements.  They also believed that only a good test program could reduce uncertainty.  A 
more detailed description and analysis of Lunar Prospector based on SPL can be found in 
Appendix B. 
 
6.1.3  CONTOUR 
 
As the sixth mission in NASA’s successful Discovery Program, the Comet Nucleus Tour 
(CONTOUR) was a joint project between Corne ll University and Johns Hopkins University 
Applied Physics Laboratory (APL), along with 14 other university, government, and industry co-
investigators to study three major near-Ear th comets. With a budget of $159 million and a 
development time of almost 3 years, it was sc heduled to fly within 60 miles of each of three 
comets.  From 2003 to 2008, CONTOUR would ta ke images, make spectral maps, and analyze 
dust flowing from the comets to substant ially improve the knowledge base and expand the 
understanding of comets.   
 
As a breakthrough product, CONTOUR was a singl e spacecraft and six scientific instruments 
designed to provide a detailed look at come ts and answer questions about how comets act and 
evolve.  While much of the technology was known, its application and what CONTOUR was 
planned to accomplish made it different from any thing that had been done before.  No one in the 
 
 35
history of space exploration had brought a spacecra ft as close to a comet as CONTOUR would.  
While using predominantly existing, off-the-s helf technology and technology from previous 
missions, CONTOUR was flying for the first ti me a non-coherent DOPPLER navigation system 
and a Solid Rocket Motor (SRM) that had not been thoroughly tested with the spacecraft.  
As a project, CONTOUR was to design, test, and develop an orbiter that would obtain scientific 
data on comets and reaffirm the success of “ better, faster, cheaper.”  CONTOUR could be 
described as a high-tech project.  While much of the technology was proven from the Stardust 
and Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR) spacecrafts, its application and its unprecedented 
scientific objectives made it different than anyth ing that had been done before.  The complexity of 
the project could be described as a system wi th a collection of interactive elements and 
subsystems that had to perform a wide range of  functions under extreme requirements.  The 
pace of the project was a blitz-critical project.  Wh ile many of the characteristics point to a fast-
competitive project, it is the inflexible l aunch date of CONTOUR and most Discovery Program 
missions that moved it into a blitz-critical mode.   Any error in time or budget meant cancellation 
for the project.   
 
CONTOUR was on track to be a storied success for both Cornell and APL, but the loss of 
communications on August 15, 2002 could not hav e been expected.  On that day, CONTOUR 
was scheduled to accelerate the spacecraft and place it on a trajectory toward its first comet.  
While operations continued based on the assumpti on that the firing took place on schedule, no 
signal was received from the spacecraft.  From August 16 through August 21, three objects were 
identified near the expected positi on of CONTOUR.  Communications attempts continued with the 
spacecraft once a week through December 2002, and the mission was declared officially lost 
after the December communication attempts failed.  
 
 36
Widespread faults were hard to find in CONTOUR, and it embodied many of t he characteristics of 
successful Discovery Program missions.  Managem ent brought to the project years of success 
and a firm belief that they knew what it woul d take to make CONTOUR successful.  However, 
with overconfidence from past success, and t he lack of a good framework for determining the 
technological complexity, CONTOUR was cha llenged with not having a clear understanding of 
the technological uncertainty.  The challenges and pressures of BFC resulted in a need for 
clearer lines of leadership, collocating key subs ystems, having team members 100 percent on the 
project (cradle to grave), and independent in-depth, active technical reviews with outside experts. 
A more detailed description and analysis of CONTOUR based on SPL can be found in Appendix 
C. 
 
6.1.4  Mars Climate Orbiter 
 
In 1993, NASA started the Mars Surveyor Program to  develop a series of missions to study Mars.  
A Mars Program Office was established and given the responsibility of defining the objectives of 
these Mars exploration missions.  Chartered under this office would be two missions with biennial 
launching opportunities (Mars Climate Orbiter and Mars Polar Lander).  The Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory (JPL) created the Mars Surveyor Projec t ’98 (Mars ‘98), which would be responsible 
for these missions.  One of these missions, the Mars Climate Orbiter (MCO), was a strategic 
project that would help build a sustained position in space exploration with recent successes in 
Mars exploration (Mars Pathfinder and Mars Gl obal Surveyor).  MCO would build upon those 
successes and lay the groundwork for several planned Mars exploration missions over the next 
15 years.  MCO was a tangible product of a spacec raft, orbiter, and scientific instruments, which 
required a significant level of insight and creat ivity both technically and managerially, built around 
a core of talented, experienced people to produce a valued product.    
As a project, MCO was to design, test, develop, launch, and operate an orbiter that would collect 
weather data from Mars and act as a relay stati on for 5 years, assisting in data transmission to 
 
 37
and from the Mars Polar Lander (MPL).  Join tly developed with the MPL and 300 people from JPL 
and Lockheed-Martin, the project had a 37-month development schedule, with spacecraft launch 
masses of a medium-light class launch vehicl e and a financial cap of about $184 million (covering 
development of the spacecraft, scientific payl oads, and the ground operations system).  MCO 
was a high-tech project with development of one-of-a -kind, single-flight systems.  While some of 
the technology was new, much of it  existed at the time the projec t was initiated.  What was unique 
was how the technology was brought together in a single spacecraft.  As a complex collection of 
assemblies that were to perform multiple functi ons under the guidance of a main contractor with 
tight and formal controls, MCO could be described as a system.  The pace of the project was a 
blitz-critical project.  Time was critical for pr oject success and marginal fluctuations in time and 
budgets meant project failure.  
On September 23, 1999, MCO began its orbiter in sertion maneuver, but shortly after beginning, 
the signal was lost from MCO, and on September  24, search for the orbiter was abandoned.  On 
September 30, a JPL peer review committee repor ted that small forces of velocity changes 
reported by the spacecraft engineers used in orbit in sertion were low and the likely causes of the 
MCO loss.  On October 6, a MCO Mission Failure  Investigation Board was appointed by NASA to 
independently investigate all aspects of the failure of the mission.  On November 10, the Board 
released its report that idenified the root cause for the loss of the MCO spacecraft as the failure to 
use metric units in the c oding of a ground software file. 
 While the root technical cause was a software c oding failure, the overarching cause of the MCO 
loss was a stategy designed to address cost goals more than capability objectives.  This can be 
attribued to the pressures and challenges of BFC, wh ich resulted in cuts in areas that later proved 
to be key in contributing to MCO’s failure.  Be cause of cost constrains, peer reviews were de-
emphasized, there was not an active involvem ent from experts, dual development was used on 
subsystems for multiple missions, the number of  people on the project was kept below minimum, 
 
 38
expertise for key subsystems was unavailable to  the project, testing was streamlined in key 
areas, and key policy was reduced.  Designing to  capabilities might have revealed that this 
project could not have been completed under the specif ied budget.  With all of its constraints, the 
MCO team maintained a high spirit with an unmat ched drive to be successful.  Unfortunately, not 
managing the spirit resulted in team member s overworking themselves and not having enough 
time to stop and think about their actions.  A more detailed description and analysis of MCO 
based on SPL can be found in Appendix D.

6.2  Analysis 
6.2.1  Leadership 
In SPL, leaders create vision and meaning, and develop fresh approaches to long-standing 
problems.  SPL states that proj ects are where ideas are transferr ed into tangible results through a 
vision.  Project managers must be effective leaders, efficient managers, and technically 
competent.  They must take responsibility for the vision, its execution, and the ultimate business 
results.  
Project managers must be effective leader s, an efficient managers, and technically 
competent:   For the projects investigated, projec t managers were experienced both as project 
managers and as engineers or scientists.  In all f our projects, the project managers had previous 
experience in managing multiple deep space projec ts and brought to the projects at least 15 
years of experience as engineers.  Most of t he project managers and/or principal investigators 
were far enough along in their careers at the time of the project that many retired shortly after the 
projects were completed.  Therefore, the failure s or successes in the projects cannot be directly 
correlated to the talent but may more be reflect the leadership style. 
 In Mars Pathfinder and Lunar Prospec tor, project managers were quick to explain that they were 
willing to “pick up a wrench” to help ensure a pr oject stayed on schedule.  Brian Muirhead, Mars 
Pathfinder Lander manager, stated “…a manager must conf idently reach into a project to move it 
forward.”  Alan Binder, Lunar Prospector prin cipal investigator, and Matt Dougherty, Lunar 
Prospector project manager, understood the syst ems they were developing very well and 
believed in working side by side with engineers to  meet a project’s milestones.  For CONTOUR 
and MCO, the project management took a more hands -off approach.  They believed in letting the 
engineers and scientist concentrate on the tasks at  hand so they did not have to worry about 
management issues.  Mary Chiu, CONTOUR pr oject manager, believed that managers should 
work for an informed, nonintrusive style.   CONTOUR management believed that engineers 
 
 40
should be allowed to perform their jobs without  the restriction of managerial interference and 
believed the efforts of project management should be focused on maintaining the project strategy, 
structure, and lines of communication.  MCO management also believed in empowering their 
engineers to be engineers and concentrating their own efforts on managing the cost, schedule, 
and budget. 
 Project managers take responsibility for the vision, its execution, and the ultimate 
business results:   For Mars Pathfinder and Lunar Prospecto r, the lines of leadership were 
clearly defined.  Team members explained that t hey knew exactly who they were accountable to 
and what they were accountable for.  Managers in stilled a clear vision of success in each of the 
team members.  Donna Shirley, Rover projec t manager, stated that the leadership had a clear 
vision and backed up their words with actions.  Fo r Lunar Prospector, leadership followed a more 
dictatorial style.  Alan Binder brought his belie f in the vision for project success and stated “you 
get nowhere by doing things by committee.”  He  and Matt Dougherty took complete control of 
Lunar Prospector and quickly removed anyone from t he project who could not work in that 
environment.  With this control, Binder and D ougherty believed that a person must be able to 
“take blame when something goes wrong.”  In CONTOUR and MCO, lines of leadership were unclear and some described confusion about who wa s in charge or who to go to in certain 
situations.  The CONTOUR Mishap Investigat ion Board Report sited communication problems 
between major subsystems during the spacec raft development.  In addition, some managers 
commented that conflicting directions came from  top management, and it was “unclear who within 
top management was in charge.”  The MCO Mishap Investigation Board Report sited that there 
was “little evidence of contact” between line s upervisors and system engineer s on some systems.  
Many team members did not identify proj ect managers as team leaders, and one manager 
identified the leadership style as “autocrati c with tendencies to breed conflict.”  Table 2 
summarizes the leadership successes or f aults in the four projects studied.

Mars 
Pathfinder Empowered the people; brought a willingness to 
do things differently; made the people, not the 
policy, responsible for project success. “The most successful leaders have learned 
to channel their own emotional energy, 
focusing it to energize their people.” Leaders have to reassure their people that they 
share the same goals for the final products. 
— High Velocity Leadership: The Mars 
Pathfinder Approach 
 
Once they’ve gone beyond your ability to 
understand them, then you have to make a choice as a manager.  You can limit them and the 
project by your intelligence, or you can trust them 
and use your management skills to keep them focused on the goal.

Lunar 
Prospector Hands-on (pick-up a wrench), included people in 
the decision-making process, spent time on the front end, and then let the project go. “I was not the manager who sat in my big 
soft chair somewhere and just wrote memos.  I was down there.” 
 
“It was very much by delegation and holding people accountable to high level 
requirements rather than detailed 
specifications.” The first things the pr oject manager did was sit 
the engineers down and explain the philosophy, history, and what Lunar Prospector was trying to 
accomplish. 
— project presentation and plan 
CONTOUR Limited oversight and guidance from leadership . “We basically tried to reach a balance 
between enough structure to do things well, 
also enough flexibility to allow individuals the 
opportunity to do the things they needed to do.” Significant reliance on s ubcontractors without 
adequate oversight, insight, and review. 
— Mishap Investigation Board Report 
MCO There were limited accountability and authority, 
unclear lines of leadership , inexperience in some 
areas of management, and a lack of trust from all 
the team. “The openness to the navigation process 
while empowering junior engineers with limited depth was too much for those 
engineers to handle.” 
 Team member stated at times they were not 
sure who was in charge or who was the 
mission manager. Project managers were competent, but 
inexperienced.  Inexperience was identified by the MIB as one of the root causes for MCO’s 
failure. 
— Mishap Investigation Board Report 
 
The inadequacies in experience on MCO and the 
MIB Report resulted in the establishment of a new position at JPL to specifically monitor 
projects.

 42
6.2.2  Strategy 
SPL states that project strategy feeds the project plan.  While pl ans detail the events, resources, 
schedule, requirements, and deliver ables, strategy is the action and philosophy that makes the 
plan work.  In SPL, project strategy begins by  defining the product and it s expected competitive 
advantage through six elements: objectives, produc t definition, competit ive advantage, business 
perspective, project definition, and strategic focus.   The four projects investigated were products 
defined as single spacecraft, with four or more  scientific instruments,  developed on a low-cost 
budget, and designed to encounter a celestial body  (Mars Pathfinder and MCO – Mars; Lunar 
Prospector – the Moon; and CONTOUR – multiple comets).  These products were then defined 
by projects that were competitively select ed to design, test, develop, launch and operate the 
spacecraft with minimal government funding.  
While plans detail the events, resources, schedule, requirements, and deliverables, 
strategy is the action and philosophy that makes the plan work:  For the four projects, the 
strategies were set early, articulated often, and focused on project success.  Mars Pathfinder and 
Lunar Prospector believed that the philosophy  of a strategic approach supported by a 
commitment to the vision was one of the keys to success.  Wayne Lee stated that for Mars 
Pathfinder to be successful the nonstrategic fo cus that had been present in many past space 
exploration projects had to change.  For Brian Muirhead, this meant having clear linkages among 
the strategy, vision and objectives.  Mars Path finder took what Donna Shirley called, “modest, 
simple objectives,” added to it what Brian Muir head called a philosophy of “take risk, don’t fail,” 
and created a project strategy that was “commi tted to success.”  Management then believed that 
this strategy and the philosophy that it was built on should be reevaluated and articulated often 
throughout the project.  For Lunar Prospector, the strategy focused on what Scott Hubbard, Lunar 
Prospector program manager, called “value-added r equirements.”   When Alan Binder was asked 
what the strategy for Lunar Prospector was, he answered simply, “You are responsible, you’re 
 
 43
responsible to me, no passing the buck, keep it si mple, and do it on time.  If there is a problem, 
we sit down together and fix it right then and there.  That was the whole strategy.” 
 
For CONTOUR and MCO, the strategy was fo cused on operational success and not strategic 
success.  CONTOUR believed in setting the strat egy early, articulating it to the team, and then 
considering it a “done deal.”  Mary Chiu stated that her responsibility as project manager was to 
keep the team focused on the strat egy by reiterating it several times throughout the project.  But 
for CONTOUR, as the plan changed, the strat egy never wavered.  For MCO, technical 
motivations were strong, but the drive to devel op MCO at a bare minimum cost was what fostered 
the strategy.  JPL made several cost-driven strategic decisions that ultimately became key for 
MCO.  One of those decisions was to use much of the science from the failed Mars Observer.  
The second was to award a contract for spac ecraft development that would result in an 
opportunity for up to eight almost identical s pacecraft.  Noel Hinners, Lockheed-Martin program 
manager, said, “Your competitive environment tends to push you to bidding lower cost to try and 
squeeze all of the cost out the first time.  To try to win.”  This approach fostered an operational 
approach to MCO and was later described by Peter Ru tledge, investigative lead from the Office of 
Safety and Mission Assurance, as not what was done to guarantee success but what was not 
done.  
SPL states that project strategy begins by defining the product and its expected 
competitive advantage through the six elements:  Usually, NASA projects  are supported by a 
congressional or administrative push.  In some  cases, they are developed from a scientific 
community pull.  In either case, there is usua lly minimal traditional business competition.  For 
each of the projects, one of the hardest questions  to answer was “What was your competitive 
advantage?”  The most common answer was “We we re a government project, so we do not have 
competition.”  While this may have been the belief of many of the interviewees, it was not the 
case for all of the projects.  Mars Pathfi nder was hand-picked by NASA to be the “hallmark” 
 
 44
mission for BFC, but fought hard to differentiate it self from a mission at Ames Research Center 
that was also in consideration.  Lunar Prospecto r was the first competit ively selected Discovery 
Program mission using a peer review process.  CONTOUR was also competitively selected 
through the Discovery Program, and APL’s proposal was rejected the first time they applied.  
While MCO was defined by NASA, the spacecra ft development was awarded to Lockheed-Martin 
through an intensely competitive selection.  T hough each of the projects brought a competitive 
advantage that the interviewees c ould not clearly define, they we re able to define the value. 
Because these were scientific projects with sci entific objectives, they defined their value as 
delivering “category one” science to the scient ific community, and success was defined as 
meeting their scientific objectives.  For Mars Pathfinder and Lunar Prospector, they maintained a 
focus on the value of scientific return without bei ng distracted by traditional project constraints of 
cost, schedule, and performance.  For CONTOUR and MCO, cost pressures overshadowed 
performance goals and resulted in project failure.  For CONTOUR, this became evident when, 
after the Phase A/B evaluation, the project was threatened with cancellation because of high cost 
estimations.  For MCO, the extreme pressure to perform two missions (MCO and MPL) on the 
same budget as Mars Pathfinder resulted in a design to cost and not requirements.  Table 3 
summarizes the strategy successes or f aults in the four projects studied.

6.2.3  Spirit 
In SPL, the leaders are responsible for creating a sp irit that effectively articulates an inspiring 
vision that mobilizes people’s motivation.  SPL def ines spirit by the product vision and individual 
project culture.  
The leaders are responsible for creating a spirit that effectively articulates an inspiring 
vision that mobilizes people’s motivation:   For the projects investigated, the vision grew from 
a fundamental challenge of developing a comp lex product on an extremely reduced budget and 
schedule.  For these projects, the vision was focused on doing what others could not, and finding 
new ways of accomplishing what many defined as impossible.  Alan Binder stated, “You’ve got to 
change the culture, you can’t do things this way if you’re going to keep the old culture.”  In each of 
the projects, the interviewees described the spirit that rose from the project vision as unlike any 
other project they had worked on.  For the four  projects, management found themselves in the 
position of not having to create spirit, but m anaging it.  In Mars Pathfinder and Lunar Prospector 
management kept a tight eye on the spirit to make  sure that team members did not overwork 
themselves because of their se lf-motivation and when needed, effect ively reached into the project 
to pull them along.  Wayne Lee stated that Mars Pa thfinder “found ways to take things out of the 
rigor of the everyday process of NASA’s very  straight-laced organization and put some humanity 
and some fun into the process.”  Alan Binder, when asked about Lunar Prospector’s spirit, said, 
“Without that we would have never  had achieved anything.”  In each of the four projects, team 
members felt a personal ownership in the project’ s success or failure.  Mary Chiu described this 
ownership of CONTOUR as a sense of “family.” 
 
Unfortunately, this strong cohesive spirit became a mixed blessing when it was unmanaged and 
resulted in some failures.  For CONTOUR, managem ent held the spirit back or did not effectively 
pull it along at the right time, and for MCO it did not effectively limit the spirit.  After the Phase A/B 
Study on CONTOUR, management was hit with the r eality of enormous cost constraints, and the 
 
 47
prospect of significant cost overruns.  Budgetar y issues in any NASA project can quickly lead to 
project termination, so the CONTOUR team was under  great pressure to reduce costs.  This was 
a time when CONTOUR’s spirit was at its lowest and a time when management needed to 
effectively manage the spirit.  In Mars Pathfinder  and Lunar Prospector, spirit drove the teams to 
work extra hours to get the job done, conversely , CONTOUR management controlled the spirit by 
making sure that people only worked 40-hour weeks.  In projects with limited schedules and fixed 
launch dates, team members routinely work ex tra hours to guarantee project success.  MCO was 
described by the interviewees as very high- spirited and committed to success.  Noel Hinners 
stated, “There was not anybody  who had any doubt that we were going to succeed.”  
Management stated that motivating the team was the least of their concerns.  But, by not 
managing the spirit and drive of the team, they ended up with too much of a good thing.  Team 
members worked themselves too hard, resulti ng in lack of concentration at times, not enough 
time to think about the decisions they had made, and an extreme level of confidence.  Ed Euler, 
MCO project manager, said that with such a hi ghly motivated team that worked sometimes 100-
hour weeks, they never had what he called “A’ha time.”   Noel Hinners defined “A’ha time” as, 
“We were so busy doing the work that had to get done, we did not have the luxury of just sitting 
back on a weekend or when you got home at night  and just conjugating about what went on.”

of the Mars 98 failures, felt excessive pressure

happened on the spacecraft right before us, 
and with the Mars failures and the Mars Observer failure, we were making damn sure 
that we were not going to repeat the same 
problems that they had.  But something else got us.” 
 “A lot of sole searching as far as what was

stage there were some low points.” Enormous cost constraints threatened the 
project and possible cancellation after the 
Phase A/B Study.

doing something 
different and challenging.  Sense of urgency; and 
excessive pressure to

“It was very difficult for people to understand 
the environment that the NASA administrator 
had established.  The axe he was holding over everybody.  It was a challenge we 
accepted, and we paid the consequences.” The fixed launch date put tremendous 
pressure on project personnel, not allowing

6.2.4  Adaptation 
There is a fundamental difficultly with NASA BFC projects when attempting to define their 
Novelty, Technology, Complexity, and Pace.  The shear fact that a project is attempting to 
explore the universe or launch into space can define the project as no less than high-tech; the 
level of risk and integration associated with such  missions define their complexity no less than a 
system; the technological challenges and requirem ents of space exploration make them no less 
than a breakthrough; and the celestial mechani cs or “launch windows” imposed on a BFC mission 
from their inception make them no less than blitz- critical.  It appears from this research that a 
BFC mission should be defined and managed as a high-te ch, system, breakthrough, blitz-critical 
project. 
 Figure 3 represents a summary of how the pr ojects were managed based on the NCTP model.  
The successful projects not only applied the right  project typology, but also the right approaches 
for that typology, while the projects that failed lacked a framework that would allow them to apply 
the correct project management to project ty pe approach. Connecting the NCTP classification 
with a straight line to form a diamond gives a repr esentation of the level of risk associated with a 
project.  The greater the area of the diamond, the greater the degree of risk.  Figure 3 also 
represents how each of the projects differed in their level of risk, and how the projects that failed, 
assumed a lower level of risk.  The green lines r epresent the correct project classifications.  The 
red dashed lines represent how the projects were managed.  While there is not a linear 
relationship between the area of the diamond for correct and incorrect project risk, it does 
represent a difference in the degree of risk.  To fu rther explain this, Table 5 offers an overview of 
the actual and required project adaptation for eac h of the projects followed by a detailed 
explanation.

Table 5 shows that for Mars Pathfinder and Lunar Prospector the required and actual approach 
were equal.  For CONTOUR and MCO cost constraints and pressures to be successful in a BFC 
environment resulted in management making heuristi c decisions on what to cut back to save 
costs.  These items became important to the su ccess or contributed to the failure of the two 
projects.  Ed Euler, MCO proj ect manager, stated that during t he preproject development process 
and during the project the pressure of meeting the cost and schedule goals resulted in increasing 
risk and “knowingly cutting proven engineering pr actices to meet the cost and schedule 
demands.”  For CONTOUR, critical redesigns at the end of the Phase A/B study created what Ed 
Reynolds defined as “doing a big rocket mission on a little rocket.”  Table 6 shows a comparison

Novelty  
 
Mars Pathfinder:   Mars Pathfinder was a breakthrough product that introduced to the world a 
new way of landing on Mars, and more significant, a robotic rover to traverse the planet.  No 
exploration robot has ever traversed a planet in t he history of space exploration.  Mars Pathfinder 
opened new possibilities to space exploration with a foundation built on a limited historical record 
of similar past projects.  Because of time constraints, development was quick and prototyping 
almost seemed parallel with assembly.  Mars  Pathfinder maintained a flexible approach to 
development while using intuition, excessive te sting, and a learn-as-you-go mentality. While 
keeping a strict eye on the project objectives, sc hedule and cost, they were flexible with changes 
to stay focused on success.  With such a fast development pace, Mars Pathfinder made sure they 
kept their customer educated about t he potential risks and ultimate success. 
 
Lunar Prospector:  Lunar Prospector was a breakthr ough product.  Lunar Prospector put 
existing technology to new use, in itself a breakthrough in the aerospace industry, and pushed the 
boundaries of cost-effective space ex ploration.  While there was much to be learned from Apollo, 
these early lunar missions only opened 20 percent  of our understanding of the Moon, and little 
had been accomplished in lunar exploration since Apollo.  Therefore, Lunar Prospector was 
based largely on scientific fundamentals, with limit ed experience in similar products and history of 
trial and error.  This meant fast prototypi ng, keeping a close, honest relationship with its 
customer, and late design freezes.  
CONTOUR:   CONTOUR was a breakthrough project.  No one in the history of space exploration 
had brought a spacecraft as close to a comet as was planned for CONTOUR.  Almost all of the 
technology they were using existed, was prev iously tested, or was being tested on NEAR and 
Stardust.  Although APL had been successful with recent missions, not one successful mission 
had been repeated.  Each mission, even if using si milar, proven technology from past missions, 
 
 54
had some degree of unproven technology and was a new  venture.  CONTOUR was no exception.  
There was still a lot to be learned about how to per form an Earth swing-by and rendezvous with a 
comet.  Traveling to a comet incorporated a lot of  calculated risks, intuition, and trial and error.  
CONTOUR would require fast prototyping, late des ign freezes, and constant interactions with its 
customers. 
 
In many respects, CONTOUR was very new bec ause this technology was being packaging into a 
new product with a new, first-time-used, nonc oherent DOPPLER navigation system and the SRM 
had to be integrated into the spacecraft to per form the scheduled Earth swing-by maneuvers.  
This novelty in technology alone defined CONT OUR as a breakthrough project, but it was 
managed as a platform project.  Without a fram ework to understand the right management style, 
management believed that they were building upon the success and technology of past missions 
(NEAR and Stardust) and approached th is project as a derivativ e project.  This gave the 
perception that CONTOUR would be a next generati on in existing technology.  Few projects in 
space exploration can be defined as platform projects (e.g. Expendable Launch Vehicles – Delta 
II, Atlas). 
 Mars Climate Orbiter:   MCO was a new-to-the-world product that developed a new use for a 
product that NASA had not seen before.  That def ined MCO as a breakthrough project.  As the 
first in a series of Mars missions, MCO was to integrate some mature technology into a new and 
untested spacecraft.  Although NASA had been successful  with recent missions to Mars, not one 
successful mission had been repeated.  Each mission to Mars, even if using similar, proven 
technology from past missions, had some degree of unproven technology and was a new venture 
to the Red Planet.  MCO was no exception.  With only a few successful missions to Mars (Mariner, Viking I and II, Mars Global Surveyor, and Mars Pathfinder), there was still a lot to be 
learned about how to enter into Martian orbit.  Traveling to Mars still incorporated a lot of 
 
 55
calculated risks, intuition, and trial and error.  MC O would require fast prototyping, late design 
freezes, and constant interactions with its customers. 
 
Unfortunately, the cost constraints of MCO forced it to be managed and designed as a platform 
project.  Using some proven technology and the history of NASA and JPL’s successful missions 
to Mars, the strategy for MCO was that of a new generation in an existing product family.  MCO 
had minimal technological success to build on.  While MCO used some of the proven technology from the Mars Observer and Mars Global Su rveyor, only the Mars Global Surveyor had been 
successful.  Fast prototyping was compromis ed by inadequate testing and streamlined reviews.  
For example, the navigation softw are system was the most novel and uncertain of all the systems 
on MCO but received no more testing or review  than any other system.  In addition, the 
interaction with customers was less than optim al and was sometimes defined as “confusing.”  
 
Complexity
 
 
Mars Pathfinder:   As a complex collection of a spacec raft, lander, rover, and all of its elements 
and subsystems, Mars Pathfinder was a system pr oject.  While JPL led the effort for Mars 
Pathfinder, it relied heavily on subcontracts with other institutions to deliver the scientific 
instruments.  With Mars Pathfinder’s unprecedent ed public exposure, its customer base spanned   
from industry to government and the public to t he scientific community.  As a systems project 
Mars Pathfinder was a complex project that r equired extensive planning, sophisticated computer 
and software tools, a complex contract with m any internal and extern subcontracts, tight and 
formal control, strict financial and schedule requirements, reviews with customers and 
management.  It was JPL’s ultimate responsib ility to guarantee integration and performance 
within the project budget, time, and quality constrai nts.  While Mars Pathfinder followed NASA’s 
strict requirements for documentat ion, great attempts were made to minimize the level of 
documentation to reduce time requirements.  With  Mars Pathfinder’s high profile, the level of 
 
 56
oversight was not limited to JPL, but stretc hed through the ranks of NASA.  The level of 
bureaucracy was far above that of any assembly project. 
 
Lunar Prospector:   Lunar Prospector was a system proj ect.  As a complex integration of 
scientific instruments and spacecraft subsystems , Lunar Prospector was led by a main program 
office, Ames Research Center, directing a pr ime contractor, Lockheed-Martin.  There were 
several other subcontractors to produce the scient ific instruments with a mix of in-house and 
external development.  While Lockheed-Martin  managed the project, Ames was ultimately 
accountable for the spacecraft.  Though documentati on was kept minimal, the level required for 
any complex NASA project is extensive.  Lunar Prospector was managed with a pure project 
structure, with tight control over the projec t and extensive reviews with the customer.  Lunar 
Prospector had multiple key customers from i ndustry, government, the public and the scientific 
community that were all vested in the project’ s development and success.  As a systems project, 
Lunar Prospector was a complex project that r equired extensive planning,  computerized tools and 
software, hundreds or thousands of  activities, tight and formal control, financial and schedule 
requirements, and reviews with customers and management. 
 CONTOUR:  CONTOUR was a system project that under stood the integration and complexity of 
that integration to develop a spacecraft.  CONTOUR management approached the project with a 
formal and bureaucratic style mixed with some in formal relationships with subcontractors and 
customers.  It required tight and formal contro l on technical, financial and schedule requirements 
supported by many internal and external subc ontracts.  APL led the spacecraft development, 
Cornell University led the science, and other in stitutions were subc ontracted to develop the 
scientific instruments.  Multiple key custom ers from industry, government, the public and the 
scientific community were dependent on CONTO UR’s success.  As a systems project, 
CONTOUR was a complex project that requir ed extensive planning, computerized tools and 
 
 57
software, tight and formal control, financial and schedule requirements, reviews with customers 
and management, and extensive documentation. 
 
While much of the development occurred in-house at APL, a significant portion of the scientific 
development occurred outside to APL.  This geographic separation between major systems and 
management (principal investigator and project manager) restricted real-time, face-to-face 
communication.  While CONTOUR understood the subs ystems of the spacecraft very well, a lack 
of framework to define unique project characteristi cs resulted in performing integration testing late 
in the development, thus not giving them a full under standing of the uncertainty of the system.  In 
addition, being a heavily matrixed organization, team me mbers were not able to cut ties with their 
parent organizations to fully commit to the project.  
Mars Climate Orbiter:   As a very complex interaction of subsystems and elements performing 
multiple functions, MCO was a system project.  In addition to its own complexity, MCO was 
designed to work with the MPL when it arrived at  Mars.  MCO had multiple key customers from 
industry, government, the public and the scientific  community that were all vested in MCO’s 
development and success.  As a systems projec t, MCO was a complex project that required 
extensive planning, computerized tools and software, hundreds or t housands of activities, tight 
and formal control, financial and schedule r equirements, reviews with customers and 
management, and extensive documentation. 
 MCO was managed with its main contract under JP L and the Mars Surveyor ’98 office, and with 
several smaller subcontracts to complete the dev elopment.  The control of MCO was formal with 
standard reviews, but not tight.  Management worked to empower the subsystem engineers and 
therefore did not play an integral role in overseei ng the project integration.  This was reflected in 
reviews and control of technical, financial, and schedule requirements.  Reduced involvement in 
these areas because of cost constraints resulted in limited control of the subsystem integration 
 
 58
and the absence of adequate end-to-end verification and validation through reviews.  While much 
of the project was treated as a system, certain s ubsystems with high levels  of uncertainty were 
managed as assembly projects (e.g., navigation).  Key people were balancing time with multiple 
projects and working the same type of subsyste m for each project, while the process that each 
project was using was different.  This was compounded by a lack of communication and transition 
between phases and subsystem operations.  Inher itance from past systems was assumed to 
reduce the uncertainty, but it did not reduce the uncer tainty of integration.  Key to any system is 
an understanding of the impact change and risk have on any  subsystem.  To treat any part of a 
system as an assembly is to treat the entire system as an assembly.   
 
Technology  
 
Mars Pathfinder:   Mars Pathfinder was a high-tech proj ect.  While most of the technology was 
commercial-off-the-shelf, there was a significant  portion of the technology that was new to 
planetary exploration.  As a pr oduct, Mars Pathfinder was the first of its kind; integrating the 
technology in a way that had never been done before.   Mars Pathfinder required long periods of 
design, development, testing, and redesign with mult iple design cycles that had to start before the 
project started.  With the extensive testing t hat was required for a high-tech project like Mars 
Pathfinder, in-depth technical reviews were mandat ory to make a project of this complexity 
successful.  In conjunction with these reviews, communication had to be frequent and active.  The complexity and communication demands required management to possess good technical skills 
and be intimately involved in the project.  They  also had to recognize the unique challenges of 
Mars Pathfinder and be flexible to extensive testing and design changes.  Therefore, design 
freezes had to be scheduled as late as possible.   
 
Lunar Prospector:   Lunar Prospector was a high-tech pr oject.  As a produc t, Lunar Prospector 
was not revolutionary but maintained a simple design using proven technology with only a few 
 
 59
new iterations of those technologies.  Although most of the technology was commercial off-the-
shelf or borrowed from other prov en spacecraft, it was innovative in its application.  With a simple 
design (by NASA standards), the project still in volved long periods of design, development, 
testing, and redesign and multiple design cycles t hat had to start before the project to make a 
project of this complexity successful.  In  conjunction with these reviews and testing, 
communication had to be frequent and active.  Good technical skills, intimate involvement, and 
active communication from management were mandat ory for Lunar Prospector.  They also had to 
recognize the unique challenges of Lunar Prospec tor and be flexible to extensive testing and 
design changes.  Therefore, desi gn freezes had to be scheduled and as late as possible.  Lunar 
Prospector management had a clear understanding of the complexity of the technology they were 
dealing with and applied the right level of design constraints to the project to ensure success. 
 
CONTOUR:  CONTOUR was a high-tech project.  The technology was mostly proven but being 
was applied in a new way.  Significant improv ements were made to the technology to develop 
CONTOUR from its original design, with minor m odification to bring it together to function as a 
complete system.  CONTOUR required long per iods of design, development, testing, and 
redesign with multiple design cycles that had to  start before the project started.  In-depth, 
technical reviews were mandatory and had to be supported by frequent and active communication.  The complexity and communication demands required an intimately involved 
management team with good technical skills.  Management also had to recognize the unique 
challenges of CONTOUR and be flexible to ex tensive testing and design changes; therefore, 
design freezes had to occur as late as possible.   
 
Without a NASA-specific framework for distinguishing CONTOUR’s unique technology 
characteristics, CONTOUR assumed a lower level of  uncertainty in the technology that they were 
using for the mission and managed the project more lik e a medium-tech project.  This resulted in 
approaching the technology as a nonrevolutionar y improvement to past missions when the 
 
 60
application of the technology was very much the fi rst of its kind.  Development and testing of the 
integration of the Solid Rocket Motor (SRM) wa s limited and did not receive extensive review. 
Communication was not as frequent with subcont ractors and key contributors as was needed for 
a high-tech project.  
Mars Climate Orbiter:   MCO was a high-tech project that  used a mixture of existing and new 
technology.  Much of the technology on MCO had been developed prior to the project’s inception 
and building an orbiter spacecraft was not new.  But MCO was the first of its kind.  MCO required 
long periods of design, development, testing, and r edesign with multiple design cycles.  With the 
extensive testing that was requir ed for a high-tech project like MCO, in-depth, technical reviews 
were mandatory, and in conjunction with these reviews, communication had to be frequent and active.  Management had to possess good technical skills and be intimately involved.  
Recognizing the unique challenges of MCO, they al so had to be flexible to extensive testing and 
design changes with scheduled design freezes.    
MCO, more than any other project, was under extr eme pressure to push the boundaries of BFC.  
These pressures, constraints, and challenges limited MCO’s ability to fully recognize its 
technological challenges, thus MCO was managed more  as a medium-tech project.  There were 
not enough testing, reviews, communication, or te chnical skills to manage a high-tech project.  
Many of these key elements to managing a high- tech project were reduced to meet cost and 
schedule constraints, while some were just overlooked.  The dependence on inheritance systems 
(e.g., navigation) eventually contributed to the failu re of MCO.  While inheritance allowed for the 
reduction in time, cost, and uncertainty in devel opment, it did not reduce the need for extensive 
testing and review of the system s integration.  MCO was treated as a “just like Mars Global 
Surveyor” spacecraft, and without a good understandi ng of the uncertainty, limited action was 
taken to reduce the risk.  Testing, verificati on, and validation were reduced, and design freezes 
were not fixed.  Because of budgetary constraint s, management left no room for error or flexibility 
 
 61
for design changes.  In-depth, technical review s were streamlined and nominal.  Insufficient 
resources were allocated for independent peer revi ews, resulting in not aggressively seeking 
experts in the field and not having peers as an integral part of the project. 
 Pace
 
 
Mars Pathfinder:   Mars Pathfinder was a blitz-critical project.  With most  deep-space projects, 
schedule, cost, and technology have limited margins.  Because of celestial mechanics, the launch 
window for a Mars mission only comes around every 24 to 26 months.  Once a launch date is 
specified for a project like Mars Pathfinder, adj ustments in the schedule are measured in days, 
not months or years, and any significant delay in the schedule means cancellation.  In addition, 
Mars Pathfinder was under a 3 year development requi rement from project start to launch.  This 
was unprecedented for a project of this size and co mplexity.  To be successful, Mars Pathfinder 
had to find new ways of doing business and work around some of the standard policies and 
procedures.  Mostly hand-picked team members, wo rked very closely with each other with a high-
spirited, dedicated attitude.  Problems were resolv ed quickly with direct lines of communication to 
management and project managers that were intimately  involved in the project in both monitoring 
and working. 
 
Lunar Prospector:   Lunar Prospector was a blitz-critical project.  All Discovery Program missions 
are under a contained development time, and any delay s in that would mean cancellation of the 
mission.  As a pure project, the team was specially assembled because of their unique and 
valued capabilities, and team members were onl y retained because they brought value to the 
project.  When a crisis arose, it was dealt wi th in a quick and effective manner.  People were 
open in any crisis, realizing the end goal was mo re important.  With a shortened development 
time, many bureaucratic policies were lifted and pr ocedures were kept to the core minimum.  
Project managers were very involved in the proj ect from beginning to end and were never afraid 
 
 62
to “pick up a wrench” to guarantee project succe ss.  In addition, management up the chain never 
questioned the status of the project.  They were k ept informed while allowing the project team the 
freedom to get the project done. 
 CONTOUR:   CONTOUR was a blitz-critical project.  Fr om the time the project got the green light, 
they were under pressure to meet a specified l aunch opportunity with a strict schedule.  Time was 
critical for project success, and delays meant project failure.  The project team had to be 
specifically picked for CONTOUR and they were considered a special group trying to achieve a 
rapid solution to a vital project.  Proc edures had to be shortened, made simple, and 
nonbureaucratic, while top management had to remain highly involved and constantly supportive.   
 The huge success of BFC at the time of CONTO UR built a confidence in Discover-class missions 
and gave the appearance that they could be managed as fast-competitive projects.  While 
management understood they were under a constrained ti me factor, they believed that the project 
could be accomplished with team members mainta ining a 40-hour workweek.  In addition, not 
having access to a framework to determine the project risk led management to believe that 
events such as integrations and testing could o ccur late and less frequently in the project.  The 
consequence was that there was not the sense of  urgency as seen in successful BFC projects. 
 
Mars Climate Orbiter:  MCO was a blitz-critical project.  Ti me was critical for project success, 
and delays would only equal failure.  Attempts were  made to hand-pick a special project team for 
MCO that would try to achieve a rapid solution to a high-profile project.  The team truly felt the 
pressure of MCO’s project schedule, sometime s working 100-hour weeks to stay on schedule.  
Procedures had to be shortened, made simple , and nonbureaucratic, while top management had 
to remain highly involved and constantly supportive.

6.2.5  Project Focus 
All of these projects could be defined as stra tegic projects, and Table 7 indicates how these 
projects could be defined as either high or low in  the Strategic, Operational, or Inspirational 
dimensions. Mars Pathfinder was attempting to prove that BFC was a viable management solution to performing low-cost, high-return spac e exploration for NASA.  Lunar Prospector, the 
first competitively selected Discovery-class mi ssion, was showing that BFC could be performed 
under a solicitation, peer-reviewed format.  CONTOUR would lay out a foundation for Cornell University and APL to build a sustained reputation in space science.  MCO would be the first in 
subsequent scientific missions to Mars and show re liable repetition in Mars exploration.  For 
CONTOUR and MCO, the focus on the project was more operational.  They believed they were 
building on past success, both in how the projects were managed and the technology.  Not recognizing the strategic signific ance of the projects, minimized the projects’ strategic focus, 
which may have contributed to the projects’ failure.  While the inspirational focus on the projects 
was variable, Mars Pathfinder and MCO had extremely high-spirited projects.  The spirit of Mars 
Pathfinder was more managed than was MCO.  Lunar Prospector and CONTOUR both had a 
high sense of spirit but not a high focus on sp irit.  While this may not have appeared to have a 
significant impact, that lack of focus was detri mental to CONTOUR when the spirit most needed 
to be managed after the project was hit with potent ial cost and schedule overruns.  Therefore, the 
level of spirit appears not to be as important as managing the spirit.

7.  CONCLUSIONS 
This investigation addressed two hypotheses: (1) NASA projects require a unique model or 
framework for project management and (2) Stra tegic Project Leadership (SPL) provides a 
fundamental framework for analyzing, planni ng, and managing NASA projects.  As will be 
described, in the projects that failed, it was not a fault of the talent, but the lack of a framework 
that could help understand the fit that is needed between the project management style and the 
risks of these programs.  It is believed from this case analysis that the projects that failed were 
forced to work under constraints that were  impossible to achieve under the combined 
requirements of “better, faster, cheaper” and high project risk.  While SPL provides a 
fundamentally unique and applicable framework for NASA projects, which may have helped in the 
projects that failed, it is still not an exact fit. 
 Hypothesis 1 – NASA projects require a uni que model or framework for project 
management:   NASA’s current policy documentati on on program and project management, NPD 
7120.4B and NPD 7120.5B, outlines the policies and pr ocesses of project initiation, approval, 
planning, and execution. Both documents menti on the need for tailoring the agency’s processes 
to program and project characteristics and leave mu ch of this interpretation or tailoring to the 
project manager.  However, no formal document makes a distinction among different project 
types or how to tailor project management to projec t characteristics.  In December 2003, Sherry 
Bucshmann, NASA Office of the Chief Engineer, stated in a presentation to the NASA/USRA 
Workshop of Research Topics in Program and Pr oject Management that NASA has identified the 
need for a project categorization scheme that s hould be reflected in the new release of NPD 
7120.5C.  
Currently, NASA uses Technology Readiness Level (TRL) to classify a project based on its stage 
of development (see Table 8).  This classifica tion is based on a technology readiness in relation 
to being acceptable for launch.  While TRL may give some indication as to a technology’s 
 
 65
developmental state, it does not correlate to any specific project m anagement principles or 
guidelines. 
 
Table 8:  Technology Readiness Level 
TRL Definition 
Level 1 Basic principles observed and supported 
Level 2 Technology concept and/or application formulated 
Level 3 Analytical and experimental critical functi on and/or characteristic proof of concept

Level 5 Component and/or breadboard validati on in relevant environment 
Level 6 System/subsystem model or prototype dem onstration in a relevant environment 
Level 7 System prototype demonstrat ion in a space environment 
Level 8 Actual system complet ed and “flight-qualified” 
Level 9 Actual system “flight-proven” through successful mission operation 
 
For processes in project development, NASA teac hes the Visual Process and Vee Model in its 
program and project management training (Forsber g, et.al., 2000).  More recently, NASA has 
begun to adopt the Department of Defense’s Spiral  Development for its Exploration Program.  
While all of these principles and practices hav e proven to be successful, they are focused on 
process issues and are not all used agency wide on all projects. 
 
The projects investigated revealed that NASA has c onstraints that are inherent in all of its space 
exploration projects, such as the harsh envir onment of space, launch window opportunities, and 
the NASA culture.  All the project managers interv iewed said they had to modify required project 
management principles and practices to be successful.  In the projects that failed, the absence of 
a framework to define the project left project managers with an inability to clearly identify the 
constraints of the project.     For all of the projects, the project managers used heuristics to make 
determinations on what to cut to meet time and budget constraints.  For the two failures, these 
heuristic decisions resulted in costly failures.  A framework may have revealed the project could 
not have been accomplished under the specified constr aints or practices.  Perrow (1999) states 
that while a decision may appear perfectly rati onal, the operator may be using it in the wrong 
 
 66
context.  An effective framework, while it may not guarantee success, can provide practitioners 
with the tools so they can rely less on heuristics.  While it is clear from this investigation that 
NASA needs a unique framework for program and pr oject management, the exact principles to 
define that framework are not clear.  This in vestigation is viewed as the foundation for the 
development of that framework. 
 Hypothesis 2 – Strategic Project Leadership provides a fundamental framework for 
analyzing, planning, and managing NASA projects :  The projects studied represented a 
maturation of BFC, and Perrow (1999) states t hat as one becomes more comfortable with a 
technology (in this case BFC), one is more willing to take the risks that may ultimately lead to 
failure.  In the case of BFC, NASA continued to  push projects to be better, faster, and cheaper 
and Dan Goldin later stated that N ASA pushed the “envelope too far.”  In The Challenger Launch 
Decision: Risky Technology, Culture, and Deviance at NASA , Vaughn (1996) adds to this 
argument as she claimed that a di saster's roots are found in the nature of an institution’s life. 
NASA is an institution that was founded on taking high-level risks.  Therefore, it could be 
concluded that BFC was destined to fail over so me period of time.  Could a framework have 
obverted or delayed the failure in BFC?  SPL defined NASA projects well and provided a 
fundamental framework for planning and managing projects.  While NASA’s policies and procedure are written to be adaptable to many projec t types, the key principles for various project 
types are not identified.  Applying SPL to the four projects studied, showed that a fundamental 
framework in planning and managing different projects  could reveal that a project may not be able 
to be successful under its constraints.  In the proj ects that were successful, SPL correlated to the 
characteristics of the project as described by the case studies.  In the projects that failed, SPL 
showed the deficiencies ultimately responsible for failure.  The application of a framework such as 
SPL in the project planning phase could have ident ified the approach deficiencies that precluded 
success. 
 
 
 67
While SPL has proven to be successful in its applicat ion to many different types of projects in 
various technology areas and has worked well in defini ng the NASA projects in this study, it is not 
an exact fit.  Some areas of SPL that need fu rther development to be effectively used as a 
fundamental framework for analyzing, planning, and managing NASA projects are strategic focus, 
pace, novelty, organization,  process, and tools. 
 
Strategy :  One of the most difficult questions for all of the interviewees to answer was “What is 
the competitive advantage of your project?”  They were quick to say that NASA projects do not 
have a competitive advantage becaus e they are government-funded.  This mentality had a direct 
impact on the project manager’s approach to the strat egic focus.  For all of these projects, the 
competitive advantage was more defi ned by the project’s value.  SPL would have to be refined in 
the area of strategic focus to be more app licable to NASA projects  with an emphasis and 
refinement of project value. 
 Pace :  There should be a distinction between blitz and critical.  While the projects studied were 
considered blitz because of their time constrai nts, and critical because of their launch window 
opportunities, this would not be the case for all NASA projects.  A type of  NASA project that was 
not studied in this investigation was a human ex ploration project.  Human factors in space 
exploration add an extreme level of risk and consequences  for failure to a project.  Many of these 
types of projects are crit ical but are not blitz. 
 Novelty : Novelty is related to a product’s uniquene ss to the market. Even though NASA products 
could make their way to the market, they ar e not designed or developed for traditional market 
applications.   Also, novelty is defined based on a comparison to the market history.  NASA 
projects are rarely repeated and thus are almost  always unique to the market (breakthrough).  
From inside the organization, some NASA projec ts may not always be viewed as breakthrough 
 
 68
projects, but often the technology or its app lication is still novel.  SPL may need a fourth 
alternative in classifying a NASA project’ s novelty between platform and breakthrough. 
 
Organization, Processes, and Tools:  While the elements of organization and processes 
helped define the four projects with respect to adaptation, there was not enough conclusive 
evidence to distinguish key factors that define a NASA project.  In addition, no unique 
management tools were identified that were not  commonly used in many projects throughout 
industry.  These are key areas t hat could use further investigati on to determine if there are unique 
characteristics to NASA projects. 
 7.1  Relation to Project Management 
 
This investigation showed that leadership, strategy , spirit, and a framework were important to the 
success of NASA BFC projects.  However, ther e is still a need to understand how these results 
correlate to the discipline of project management of complex systems.  For leadership, the case 
studies showed that project managers need to be effective leaders, efficient managers, and 
technically competent, as well as take responsibilit y for the vision, its ex ecution, and the business 
results.  This conclusion is not unique to BFC or NASA—other studies have shown that leaders in 
complex systems projects must be competent  both technically and socially (Katz, 1997). 
 
For strategy, the case studies showed that the presence of a strategic approach may have 
contributed to a project’s outcome.  The import ance of strategy in project management is well 
stated in the literature, but as Shenhar (2004) has stated, project strategy is typically the missing 
link between business strategy and the traditional proj ect plan.  This investigation concluded that 
the project managers were perceived as leaders and th is was important for the projects success.  
Shenhar and Dvir suggest that a more strategi c approach is needed for projects that must be 
managed for better business success (Shenhar, 1999a; Shenhar and Dvir, 2004).  While the 
 
 69
importance of strategy was present  in the four projects investi gated and is applicable to all project 
management, the strategic approach for a NASA BF C or government project may be unique.   
 
The importance and expectations of behavioral a ttitudes of a project have been extensively 
studied with respects to project culture and spirit (Cooke and Rousseau, 1988; Organ, 1990; 
Morehead and Griffen, 1998; Greenberg and Baron, 2000) .  By managing the culture, some have 
theorized that managers can influence behavior and increase productivity (Deal and Kennedy, 
1982; Peters and Waterman, 1982; Kanter, 1983).  While this is evident in the project 
management literature, it was also shown in the ca se studies as the projects that failed did not 
adequately manage the spirit.  More important, under standing the culture/spirit for the project 
framework has an important impact on project success (Gallivan, 1997). 
 
A framework, in this case SPL, for analyzi ng, planning, and managing a project has been shown 
valuable to project management.  Currently, proj ect frameworks are designed for a limited project 
typology.  Shenhar has theorized a unique framewor k that can be used for effectively managing 
all types of projects.  This re search showed that framework c ould effectively be used to define 
NASA projects.  While these projects may have had unique characteristics, they are still 
representations of project typologi es.  Therefore, there is validat ion in the results of how these 
projects were classified to non-N ASA projects in the same classification.  Unfortunately, these 
four projects only represented one classificati on in over 200 potential outcomes in the SPL 
framework.  
7.2  Research Limitations 
 
Despite the revealing conclusions of this resear ch, it was not without limitations.  While the 
sample set used in this investigation was well defined, it was also this well-defined sample set 
that may limit the ability to correlate the results to other NASA programs and the project 
management of complex systems.  The sample  set covered only unmanned space programs at 
 
 70
three NASA centers.  NASA’s programs and pr ojects cover a multitude of technology 
developments at 10 NASA centers.  Each of t hese centers brings a unique culture and way of 
doing business that could reveal variations in t he results of this research.  This sample set 
represented only one project type in the over 200 possible project scenarios as defined by SPL.  
This can cause limitations in generalizing the conclusions to other pr ograms and projects, not 
only in NASA but across the discipline of project management.  This research stated that without 
a framework, the projects that failed were unable to properly identify a strategic approach.  These 
projects were viewed in retr ospect; therefore, the framewor k was imposed upon the project.  
While this allowed for a more extensive data collection pool, further research would have to 
validate the effectiveness of the SPL model for st rategically managing a project.  A retrospective 
view also can create some bias in the analysis as some interpretations or conclusions could 
already have been made by the interviewees  based on popular opinion and not objective 
analysis. 
 
8.  RECOMMENDATIONS 
 “FBC was reviewed extensively by the MPIAT and found to be an effective concept for guiding 
program implementation, if properly applied.” 
 - Mars Program Independent Assessment Team, 2000  
From its inception in the early years of A pollo, NASA has prided itself on pushing the boundaries 
of science and engineering and knowing how to manage these types of projects.  Any 
organization that pushes the boundaries must be w illing to accept the consequences of costly, 
visible failures.  When BFC was instituted within  NASA, the idea was to show that NASA could 
work on the edge of not only science and engineeri ng, but also management.  However, pushing 
the management boundaries requires a careful adaptat ion of risks, resources, and procedures, 
 
 71
and projects must clearly assess the complexities and uncertainties of the task.  While NASA said 
“do projects better, fast er, cheaper,” it was not clear how to do it.   
 
As has been shown, some failed projects were forced to work under constraints that were 
impossible to achieve under the combined requi rements of “better, faster, cheaper” and high 
project risk.  These projects needed a framewor k and defined principles that could help assess 
project risks and select the right approach to the right project.  There is no question that NASA 
projects are unique and have distinct ive constraints; thus the prin ciples for managing these types 
of projects should be unique as well.  As well,  there is no question that as an agency NASA has a 
vision and a legacy of taking on unique and unprecedented projects.  The most revealing 
outcome of this investigation is that N ASA needs a NASA-specific framework for understanding 
and classifying its projects.  Its technological challenges are unique; thus should be its project 
management practices. 
 The following is a summary of specific recommendations (in nonranking order) for NASA 
project/program management based the anal ysis of the four BFC projects: 
 
1. Develop a NASA-specific framework for di stinction among projects, and develop 
the unique project management characteristics that are required for each project type – Incorporate this framework and its guidelines in NASA’s procedures 
documentation (such as NPD 7120.5) and training.  Understand the technological 
complexity to apply the right management approach.  
2. Build a specific project strategy for each project that will focus on creating value 
and competitiveness.  Build a policy that supports the strategy and know its 
impact – The project strategic focus must be ti ed to the vision and objectives, and there 
must be the right balance in policy to support the strategy. 
 
 72
3. Build the project spirit, starting with a vision that will be exciting and inspiring, and 
build the project culture to support the vision  – High-spirited teams are a blessing to 
project managers, but not managing the spirit can lead to overworked team members.  
Project managers have to manage the spirit to make sure their teams have the drive and 
energy from project start to project end. 
4. Design to capabilities, not cost  – Projects that design to co st ultimately fail, or exceed 
budget and schedule.  In a project with an unmovable deliverable date, none of these 
factors can be compromised.  Designing to c apabilities can reveal whether a project can 
even be completed for the time and money specified. 
5. Technical reviews should be in-depth, independent reviews, with active 
communication with experts outside of the review  – Peer reviews and access to 
experts is one of the single most important fa ctors to project success.  They provide an 
unbiased, external, critical review of the pr oject and its technical progress.  The use of 
peers to assess a project’s development should be an integrated part of project 
management processes and procedures. 
6. Document the process for success – Documentation is the st oryline of a project’s 
process, and the process for success as well as failure should be documented.  When a project fails, it is usually  well documented and aggressive corrections are made to avoid 
future mistakes, but rarely are the factors of success documented. 
 
8.1  Future Research 
 
This research was viewed as the fundamental  development for determining a NASA-specific 
framework for program/project management with correlation to project management of complex 
systems.  Therefore, future research to further  develop the initial findings of this investigation 
should focus on: 
 
 
 73
Examine other NASA programs  – This research focused on unmanned space programs.  
NASA made its mark in space exploration with human space exploration, which raises the level of 
risk and complexity with a project that is unm atched by most standards.  In addition, all NASA 
projects are not “cutting edge.”  Further work s hould focus on NASA programs that fit into other 
dimensions of the SPL framework. 
Validate SPL as a tool  – Once SPL has been refined to fit NASA programs, it should be 
validated by practitioners (project managers, s enior executives, and decision makers) as an 
effective management tool. Evaluate projects pre- and post-project  – This investigation looked at projects after completion.  
Further analysis needs to be performed to see how  SPL is as an effective model for guiding a 
project’s success. Further investigate the SPL elements and principles for complex systems  – This research 
could not make conclusive statements about how NASA projects (or complex systems) correlated 
to all of the SPL elements and principles.  Furt her research should determine if there are unique 
characteristics for NASA projects (and complex systems) for other SPL elements and principles.

Mars Pathfinder 1Executive Summary 
 
In 1993, Congress approved a plan proposed by NASA’ s Space Science Enterprise for better, 
faster, cheaper planetary missions called the Discovery  Program.  To show Congress that it could 
be done, NASA selected two charter missions - one at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and 
one at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Ph ysics Laboratory (APL).  Mars Pathfinder was 
chosen at JPL as a scientific mission set out to broaden the underst anding of Mars and show that 
Better, Faster, Cheaper could be done successfully.   
 
As a product Mars Pathfinder was a single vehicle (lander), with micro-rover and several instruments designed to demonstrate a low cost system for cruise, entry, descent and landing on 
Mars.  Additional objectives included the depl oyment and operation of various scientific 
instruments: stereoscopic imager  with filters on a pop up mast, alpha proton x-ray spectrometer 
(APXS), and atmospheric structure instrument/m eteorology package.  As a project Mars 
Pathfinder was to design, test, and develop a lander and rover to launch and safely land on the 
surface of Mars, at the time one of the most complex planetary exploration projects in space 
science history.  With three years for devel opment and a total cost no greater than $280 million 
(including the launch vehicle and mission operati ons) Mars Pathfinder was to demonstrate a 
simple, low-cost system, at a fixed price for pl acing a science payload on the surface of Mars at 
1/15 the cost of Viking (Viki ng cost $2.8 billion in 1997 dollars).  Mars Pathfinder was a 
breakthrough product that introduced to the wo rld a new way of landing on Mars, and more 
significantly a robotic rover to traverse the pl anet.  As a system of a complex collection of 
interactive elements and subsystems, it functi oned as one unit to meet its operational needs.  
While most of the technology to accomplish th is was commercial-off-the-shelf, there was a 
significant portion of the technology that was new to planetary exploration that made it a high-tech 
project.  As with most deep space projects, sc hedule, cost, and technology have limited margins, 
making Mars Pathfinder a b litz-critical project.   
 On July 4, 1997, Americans acro ss the country were glued to their television to see the first 
pictures come back from Mars, forever marking th is as one of NASA’s most celebrated, historic, 
and accomplished days in its history.  A whol e new generation was being introduced to the Red 
Planet through television and the Internet.  Mars Pa thfinder shattered records for web site hits, 
peaking at 1 million in a day.  From its star t, Mars Pathfinder had objectives that gave it 
unmatched constraints and science objectives that  would return an unparalleled amount of data 
to the largest science community associated with a NASA mission.  With all of Mars Pathfinder’s 
interest and success, it is not the landing on Mars that marked its success (Viking I and II 
accomplished this in 1976 and 1978 respectively), it  is the means by which it was accomplished 
that made it unique, innovat ive, and electrifying.  
 To be successful the Mars Pathfinder team had to do business differently from traditional and 
standard operating procedures.  They worked to  develop a unique culture centered around leaner 
staff, reduced overhead, empowered team members,  a willingness to do things in new ways, and 
a management team that believed in  a team of capable, self-directed members.  To build this 
cultural rules were lifted, and aut horitative structures were mini mized.  The team was hand picked 
with many being experts in their field, but mo st of all these people had to have the ability to be 
generalist and multi-disciplined.  These types of people were picked from a skill set of different 
ages and experiences, but all brought with them a level of energy and creativity to carry the 
project from beginning to end.  The leadership was committed to the goal and all actions were in line with the goals of launching every day.  This meant having a clear vision and making sure that 
that vision was part of every action.  Mars Pathfinder was successful at being on time, on budget, 
and on target, and management valued the peopl e that they empowered every day.

Mars Pathfinder 8Background 
 
January 1993 marked the start of one of NASA’s mo st accomplished success stories in the last 
20 years, Mars Pathfinder.  What would occur over the next five years (project start to 
completion) would be a project that would rece ive press coverage, congressional accolades, and 
public interest comparable to the early Shuttle years or Apollo.  Although most people were not 
aware of Mars Pathfinder until it landed on Mars, fr om its landing to completion, Mars Pathfinder 
contained the public interest.  On July 4, 1997, Americans across the country were glued to their 
television to see the first pictures come back fr om Mars, forever marking this as one of NASA’s 
most celebrated, historic, and accomplished days in its history.  A whole new generation was 
being introduced to the Red Planet through television and the Internet.  Mars Pathfinder shattered 
records for web site hits, peaking at 1 million in a day.  With all of Mars Pathfinder’s interest and 
success, it is not the landing on Mars that marked its success (Viking I and II accomplished this in 
1976 and 1978 respectively), it is the means by which it was accomplished that made it unique, 
innovative, and electrifying. 
 
Long before the Sojourner Rover would traverse the surface of Mars, NASA was developing the 
Mars Environmental SURvey (MESUR) project (Mars Pathfinders locus of innovation). The 
MESUR project had an original design to drop weat her stations around the surface of Mars. Early 
in the project budget constraints threatened to cu t the project, so NASA Ames Research Center 
(ARC) stepped forward with a reinvented MES UR and claimed they could do 16 or 24 small 
landers for a less significant budget of $200 m illion. The NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) 
did not believe that it could be done for such  a reduced budget.  JPL performed a counter study 
that peaked the interest of NASA Headquarters, but also stated that if JPL was to do such a 
project they had to run it.  JPL was known for it s planetary exploration exper tise, so what resulted 
was a clash between JPL and ARC for the rights to  develop the MESUR project. In the end, JPL 
won.  The first thing JPL did was to make it  clear that the project could not be done for $200 
million. Therefore, JPL proposed that before MESUR get start ed, a test project needed to be 
initiated, so MESUR became MESUR/Pathfinder.  Pathfinder was a proof-of-concept that would 
demonstrate that NASA could land on Mars cheaply.  At the time, there were two contractors that 
were looking at the MESUR Sy stem (Rockwell and Hughes). They were performing a Phase B 
(concept) study looking at the 16 or 24 lander system.  When Pathfinder was added there was not 
enough time to finish the MESUR study before Path finder was to start, so JPL kept the Phase B 
study going during the time that Pathfinder was being defined.  But, at some point during the 
Phase B study, it became clear that t he MESUR concept was going to be put off. 
 
With the inevitable delay in MESUR, an alte rnative was sought.  The European Space Agency 
(ESA) had been studying a similar concept to MES UR for a long time. This was a mission called 
Mars Net. In about 1994, the Mars Science Working Group recommended that instead of doing 
MESUR as a US only mission, JPL should collabor ate with ESA's Mars Net, which would put an 
orbiter around Mars and be able to pick up the signals from the landers.  Negotiations from this 
collaboration became quite extensive.  At t he time, the Europeans had a sizable seismometer 
community, so they wanted seismometers al ong with weather stations on the landers. 
Seismometers are large, require a lot of power, and are big consumers of dat a.  In addition, they 
require a constant power stream because Ma rs' quacks are unpredictable; hence, they need to 
be on at all times. Therefore, ESA was demandi ng bulkier landers than those envisioned for the 
original MESUR project.  
With the joint ESA/NASA collaboration, the Mars  Net project became InterMars Net because it 
would be an ESA orbiter with NASA landers.  ESA was quite persistent that NASA provide the 
landers with all of the ESA instruments along with all of the instruments that the NASA scientists 
wanted to carry. On top of that, the Europeans were going to provide an Arion 4 rocket as a 
Mars Pathfinder 9launch vehicle, which limited capacity. NASA claim ed that in order to get all the instruments on 
the landers, the landers had to be much larger than planned.  An agreement with ESA over mass 
could never be reached, so the number of landers was cut to three. In the end it would cost more 
to work with ESA on the modified landers then it would if NASA did their own landers. In about 
1998, it became clear to JPL that InterMars Net would not work.  Ultimately, InterMars Net was 
not selected by ESA, so the project was dropped. That meant the end of M ESUR; therefore, all 
that was left was Pathfinder.  
During the same time as the initial developm ent of MESUR, NASA and the science community 
began to look at the big missions that they had on the books.  They recognized that when Galileo 
finished its primary mission, they  would not have any actual sci ence data coming from space until 
Cassini reached Saturn in July 2004.  That was a period of seven years where there was 
absolutely no data.  So NASA started a small gr oup consisting of repres entatives from NASA and 
the science community to look at what NASA coul d do to offer more opportunities.  At the same 
time, there was a significant out-cry from the sci ence community that thos e scientist that were on 
the larger missions had career longevity in obt aining science data because there was a policy at 
that time that gave data protection ri ghts for the scientist on those projects. 
 So in the early 90's, the Office of Space Sc ience (Code S) at NASA began looking at how to 
solve this issue.  When Dr. Wesley Huntress bec ame Associate Administrator of Code S in March 
1993, he was a strong advocate of finding a way fo r NASA to provide more frequent opportunities 
for space science.  At the same time, Congre ss became aware of this issue and asked NASA to 
develop a program for smaller missions that  would allow more frequent opportunities. 
 In April 1992, Code S submitted a report to Congre ss with the basic framework for the Discovery 
Program.  These basic mission constraints missions were: 
 1.  $150 million maximum development costs. 
2.  3 years maximum development time. 
3.  Launch on nothing larger than a Delta II  
In 1993, Congress approved the plan proposed by C ode S. To show Congress that it could be 
done, Code S selected two charter missions - one to JPL and one to the Johns Hopkins 
University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL).  Because of its constraints to be a cheaper and 
smaller mission, Pathfinder was chosen at JPL, which became Mars Pathfinder.   
 
Mission Description 
 
While not all NASA projects are defined by the same mechanism, most planetary projects such 
as Mars Pathfinder do follow a usual scoping.  Th is is not a defined process but has become very 
standard.  A science advisory group typically defi nes the project scope for a planetary mission.  
For Mars Pathfinder, this was the Mars Sc ience Working Group (established for the Mars 
Program to provide direction and strategy).  The group lobbies a program office (e.g. Mars 
Program Office) and the program office goes to NASA headquarters to request a mission that 
they would like to fly.  They specify to N ASA Headquarter the amount of money that this would 
require and the science constituents it would sati sfy. NASA Headquarters then determines if they 
will fund the project, and then at project incept ion the scientific goals are set (observations, 
measurements, time needed to collect data, quality of data).  These scient ific requirements then 
drive the spacecraft design.  As with Mars Pathfinder and many pl anetary projects, what typically 
happens over the course of the project is that t he realities of building a spacecraft and having it 
operate under the specified conditions are much har der than envisioned in the beginning.  As with 
Mars Pathfinder, the scientific goals, while originally ambitious, became modest.  As one 
Mars Pathfinder 10
manager stated, “Even with a lot of  experience you always find yourself hard-pressed to meet all 
the science goals.” And the reason for that ma y be as one manager states, “You’d think they 
might learn after a while and propose less-lofty goals, but again you’re in this vicious cycle of, the 
less-lofty goals you propose, the less likely it is  that NASA Headquarters is going to sign-off on 
the mission. So naturally what happens is you st art off with this nice grand scope and by the end 
of the project you’ve whittled that down somewhat.” 
 To overcome this dilemma, Mars Pathfinder  management credits “smart project managers” 
working diligently at the beginning with the scient ific community to understand what parts of the 
science goals were the most important. One scientist stated, “You can tell an experienced 
planetary scientist from someone who’s not. Be cause someone who’s not will say, ‘Oh, 
everything’s important. You don’t do this and the missi on’s not worth flying.’ And they say that to 
everything.”   The reality as Wayne Lee, Mars Pathfinder Engineer, stated is that if “…you don’t 
back off early enough, you wind up with design headaches just before launch.” 
 From its start, Mars Pathfinder had four objec tives that gave it unmatched constraints and 
science objectives that would return an unpara lleled amount of data to the largest science 
community associated with a NASA mission.  
The Major Objectives of Mars Pathfinder were: 
 
1. "Faster, Better, and Cheaper" with three years for development and cost no greater than 
$150 million. 
2. Demonstrate a simple, low-cost system, at fixed price for placing a science payload on 
the surface of mars at 1/15 the Viking price tag (Viking cost $2.8 billion in 1997 dollars). 
3. Demonstrate NASA's commitment to low-co st planetary exploration by completing the 
mission for a total cost of $280 million including the launch vehicle and mission 
operations. 
4. Demonstrate the mobility and usefulness of  a micro-rover on the surface of Mars.  
(www.jpl.gov
) 
 
The Science Objective of Mars Pathfinder were: 
 
1. Surface morphology and geology at meter scale. 
2. Surface mineralogy and elemental composit ion of rocks, soil, and surface materials. 
3. Magnetic properties and soil mechanics of the surface. 
4. Atmospheric structure as well as diur nal and seasonal meteorological variations. 
5. Rotational and orbital dynamics of Mars. 
 
An unbelievable 2.3 billion bits of information,  including more than 16,500 images from the lander 
and 550 images from the rover as well as more than 15 chemical analyses of rocks and soil and extensive data on winds and other w eather factors were sent back to Earth from a lander that 
outlived its design by three times and a rover by 12 times.  All of these accomplishments were 
value added returns, for nobody planned for this level of success.  What was planned and made Mars Pathfinder unlike 
any mission in NASA history was that it was accomplished with 
a total budget of $270 million in a three-year timeframe – start to launch (See Table 1).  Mars Pathfinder launched atop a Delta II-
7925 launch vehicle from Cape Canav eral Air Station in Florida 
on December 4, 1996.  Once on its seven-month journey to 
Mars, it went through four trajecto ry corrections to maintain its 
flight pattern with only minor diffi culties early in the mission (two 
of the spacecraft' s five Sun sensors needed adjustment).  For 
Mars Pathfinder 11the majority of the flight, all critical spacecra ft subsystems functioned as expected.  On June 30, 
1997, the flight team commanded the spacecraft to  switch into its entry, descent, and landing 
mode.  After a much-anticipated trip to Mars, Mars Pathfinder passed into the sphere of Mars' 
gravitational influence on July 3, 1997.  Over the next six hours, Mars Pathfinder would go 
through one of the most innovative and accomplis hed planetary landings in space history (see 
Table 2 for the detailed landing sequence).

Upon hitting the Martian surface, Mars Path finder would bounce 15 times (maximum height 15 
meters) before the air-bag cushioned lander came to  rest just 20 kilometers from its targeted 
landing site.  Approximately 90 minutes after landing the first data was receiv ed by the flight team 
that the lander had fully deployed its petals.  The first transmi ssion of the lander's low-gain 
antenna was received on time with information about  the health of the spacecraft and rover; the 
spacecraft's orientation on the su rface; data about its entry, desc ent and landing; and a first look 
at the density and temperatures of the Marti an atmosphere.  On the same day, Pathfinder 
transmitted via its high-gain antenna the first images  from the lander's camera.  These images 
not only revealed a beautiful mosaic of the boulde r-strewn Ares Vallis (an ancient flood plain in 
Mars' northern hemisphere), but that the airbags had not fully retracted.  This was obstructing the 
opening of one of the ramps the rover would deploy  on. After capturing some images of the 
landscape, the lander spent the rest  of Martian day one (Sol 1) re tracting the airbag so the rover 
could roll out off the ramp.  A second problem was with communication between the lander and 
the rover.  This was attributed to the modem on the lander, but was fixed on the second day.  On 
the night of July 5, the Sojourner Rover (named after Sojourner Truth, the Civil War, African-
American crusader) extended her rocker bogies and ro lled off the Pathfinder lander. This marked 
a historic moment in space exploration with the first unmanned planetary rover.  Sojourner spent NASA-JPL 
Mars Pathfinder 12the rest of the day using it s alpha proton X-ray spectrometer (APXS) to take 10 hours of 
measurements.  Over the next two and a half months, Sojourner collected data on 15 rocks - 
including those nicknamed Yogi, Scooby Doo, and Barnacle Bill. It also performed technology 
experiments designed to provide information t hat would improve future planetary rovers.

The last successful data transmission cycle from  Pathfinder was completed on September 27, 
1997, Sol 83.  The final signal was received Oc tober 7, and for the next seven months the 
Pathfinder team attempted to contact the l ander.  Then in March 1998, the Pathfinder mission 
was officially concluded.  Based on an assumpti on that the lander was not working after the 
signal was lost, it is believed that the rover went  into a contingency mode within a few days.  This 
meant that it either was left circling the lander repeatedly or standing in place, awaiting 
instructions. 
 
In the end, Mars Pathfinder used 250 full-time , 150 part-time (lander), and 30 full-time rover 
personnel to launch, land, and operate Mars  Pathfinder.  It was launched an unprecedented 47 
months after start date and landed on the surface of  Mars 55 months after start date.  Once on 
the surface the scheduled one-month operation becam e four months with an eventual project 
completion 69 months after project start date.   
Technology Description 
 
Mars Pathfinder was a conglomeration of bot h commercial-off-the-shelf components and new 
technologies (see Figure 1 for a listing).  With each component being evaluated for its 
contribution to performance, risk, and cost.  Although Mars Pathfinder used some existing 
technology, it was a breakthrough in its tec hnological innovation of landing and operating on 
Mars Pathfinder 13New Technology  
o Free-ranging micro-rover with on-board 
autonomous navigation 
o Rocker bogie suspension 
o Solid-state X-band power amplifier 
o Radiation-hardened Loral RS6000, 32-bit 
flight computer 
o Airbags adapted for Mars atmosphere 
o Image data compression 
Existing Technology  
o Rocket assisted deceleration rockets and 
altimeter (DOD) 
o Transponder (Cassini) 
o Star Scanner (Magellan) 
o Sun sensors (Adcole Corp.) 
o Aeroshell and Parachute Design (Viking)Mars.  As a system (rover, lander, Earth) it was a 
collection of integrated software and hardware 
systems that could be classified as a high-
technology project.1   
 
The lander was controlled by a derivative of the 
commercially available IBM 6000 computer with a 32-bit architecture, which was capable of 
executing 20 million instruct ions per second.  The 
computer stored flight software as well as engineering and science data on 128 megabytes 
of DRAM.  Three solar panels provided 1,200 
watt-hours of power per day on clear days.  At 
night, it maintained power on rechargeable silver 
zinc batteries with a capacity of 40 amp-hours.  The lander carried a camera on a mast to survey 
the surroundings with a 14-degree field-of-view in 
both horizontal and vertical directions (256 by 256 pixels). The rover, Sojourner, weighing in at 
15.5 kilograms (on Earth) was equipped with 
three cameras (a forward stereo camera system 
and a rear color imaging system).  Sojourner was powered by a 0.2 square meter solar array with 
backup from lithium thionol chloride D-cell sized batteries.  Three 
radioisotope heater units containing plutonium-238 were used to give 
off about 1 watt of heat each to keep the rover’s electronics warm.  
The rover wheels and suspension us ed a rocker-bogie system that 
was unique in that it did not use springs.  Three motion sensors along the frame could detect excessive  tilt and stop the rover before 
tipping.  In addition, the rover performed technology experiments for 
future rovers: terrain geometry reconstruction from lander/rover 
imaging; basic soil mechanics by studying wheel  sinkage; path reconstruction by dead reckoning 
and track images; and vision sensor performance.  Aside from the technology experiments, the 
rover carried the alpha proton X-ray spectrometer to measure the elemental composition of the 
rocks and soil. 
 
To accomplish these technological innovations Mars 
Pathfinders team was not limited to just engineers and 
scientists from JPL.  The imager for Mars Pathfinder was developed by a team lead by the University Of Arizona 
with contributions from the Lockheed Martin Group, Max 
Planck Institute For Aeronomy in Lindau, Germany, the Technical University Of Braunschweig in Germany and 
the Ørsted Laboratory, Niels B ohr Institute for Astronomy, 
Physics and Geophysics in Copenhagen, Denmark.  The alpha and proton spectrometer portions 
were provided by the Max Planck Institute, Department of Chem istry, Mainz Germany, and the x-
ray spectrometer portion was provided by the Un iversity Of Chicago.  Other contributors or 
participants on the Mars Pathfinder project that we re not with JPL were from Ames Research 
Center, Oregon State University, Cornell Universi ty, Risoe National Laboratory, U.S. Geological 
Survey, University of Tennessee, Applied Physi cs Laboratory, Princeton University, Malin Space 
Science Systems, Inc., and DLR Inst itute for Planetary Exploration.

Strategy  
 
Objectives 
 
Mars Pathfinder maintained simple objectives centered on cost, schedule, and an attainment of 
some “modest” scientific objectives.  In the end it  would be the scientific community, user of the 
billions of bits of data returned from the mission,  and congress, ultimate funder of Mars Pathfinder 
and any future missions, that would judge it’s su ccess.  As customers to Mars Pathfinder, the 
scientific community would use the mountains of data to advance the scientific understand of 
Mars and our solar system, support graduate student s, and advance careers.  For congress, it 
would build faith in NASA’s ability to do low cost space science missions, and build support for 
future funding.  All the management on Mars Path finder believed that in order to achieve the 
project objectives they had to be constrained.  Although the objectives for Mars Pathfinder were 
modest, the means by which these objectives were  achieved were not.  The innovation of Mars 
Pathfinder did not lie in the mission objectives, but in the how.   
 
Competitive Advantage /Value 
 
It is difficult for a government project to def ine a competitive advantage.   Usually they are 
supported by a congressional or administrative pus h.  In some cases they are developed from a 
scientific community pull.  In either case there is usually little competition, but there can be a 
significant value, to congress, the agency, the public, or the scientific/engineering community it 
supports.  For any project like Mars  Pathfinder, the competition that  exists is before the project 
starts.  What typically happens is principal investigators team up with various engineers and 
scientists at specific NASA c enters to collaborate and write a proposal to NASA Headquarters. 
There may be as many as thirty other gr oups preparing proposals to meet the same 
requirements.  John Wellman, Science Instru ments Manager, said that there is definite 
competition, because their will always be another cent er that thinks they can do it better.  This 
can become severely competitive.   As Wayne Lee sa id, “It brings out the best in terms of designs 
and ideas.”  
 
For Mars Pathfinder, the competitive advantage, as Donna Shirley, Rover Project Manager, saw 
it, was partly skill and partly political, but once t he project started there was little competitive 
advantage and a lot of value.  Prior to the start of  Mars Pathfinder, JPL was in competition with 
ARC for the rights to develop Pathfinder.  Ther efore, the competitiv e advantage JPL had in the 
competition with ARC was that they had success with similar pr ojects and they had a reputation 
as the planetary center.  Before Mars Pathfinder, JPL had a project to attempt to recover a lander 
on Mars in 1971, CSAD (Capsule System Adv anced Development). It showed how to land on 
Mars very cheaply, and it used some of the sa me technology proposed for Mars Pathfinder. In 
addition, JPL had landed probes on the moon, were building small rovers, and had such a head 
start with their rover technology (e.g. Rocky 4) that no other center could come close.  It was 
evidence that JPL could be su ccessful with Mars Pathfinder.  ARC on the other hand had not 
done anything since Pioneer, and Pioneer was a simple mission compared to other JPL 
successes.  The other difficulty for space science missions is that there are usually few missions 
before it to compare against.  For Mars Pathfi nder it was Viking.  Although the comparison was 
almost incomparable in the level of constraints,  it was nonetheless compared in terms of project 
cost and scientific return. 
 Once Mars Pathfinder was initiated, the compet itive advantage transitioned in to the value of Mars 
Pathfinder.  Most members of the Mars Pathfinder t eam felt that the value of Mars Pathfinder fell 
Mars Pathfinder 15on the fundamental objectives and the primary customer s.  For instance, the first objective was to 
demonstrate NASA’s ability to do a cost-constr ained, high-performance mission with a fixed 
budget and schedule.  Mars Pathfinder was much c heaper than anything like it in the past and it 
carried an excitement that was unmatched.  This had great value to NASA in their ability to 
demonstrate to Congress, the American people, and their own administration that it could be 
done.  Therefore, it was clear t hat the value to NASA, the public, and congress were intertwined.  
The second objective was to demonstrate the te chnology that could land safely and cheaply on 
Mars.  Mars Pathfinder was a great success in the press, and at the time this was a great relief 
for an agency that was being viewed negatively in the press because of one of its largest projects 
(International Space Station).  The third was to  demonstrate the mobility and the fourth was to do 
science.  Brian Muirhead, Mars Pathfinder  Payload Manager and later Project Manager, 
emphasizes that the values match t he objective in this ranked order. 
 
Business Perspective (Success Dimensions) 
 
“Develop a plan, then improvise.” 
– Brian Muirhead, High Velocity Leadership: The Mars Pathfinder Approach  
 Mars Pathfinder developed a plan early on based on a detailed schedule and worked hard to 
maintain that schedule.  Traditionally within  NASA the standard mechanism for running planetary 
flight projects and performance metrics is a sy stem called “earned value.” Earned value is based 
on a cost per task performance standard.  For ex ample, if a project has one hundred different 
tasks (or items to procure), and each task/item has  an estimated value or cost, these tasks or 
procurements will be completed by a certain point in time.  As each one is completed, a monetary 
credit for completion is given and that is gr aphed against how much money has been spent thus 
far to see where a project is on the curve.  But as one engineer stated,  “It sounds good in theory 
until you really try to do it in practice.  You r ealize that for something that is supposed to be a 
valuable metric it is only useful to the highest-level managers somewhere looking to appease 
somebody that might have to talk to Congress or make sure you’re over budget or under budget. 
At the planetary flight projects level they kind of roll their eyes over earned va lue. You sort of do it 
because you have to, but you sort of build a gut feeling of how it’s really going.” 
 
As with any project, Mars Pathfinder viewed succe ss at many different levels and thus in many 
different ways.  For Mars Pathfinder, success wa s measured from the perspective of NASA, the 
public, and the science community.  NASA measures its success by the attainment of project 
goals.  For example, NASA headquarters will give a project a list of success metrics they have to 
accomplish for the mission to be successful, but as one engineer stated, “W hat happens is that in 
order to keep expectations down and to play down the risk of some sort of anomaly happening 
during the mission that degrades its performance from the theoretical maximum, the success 
criteria that headquarters set are actually fairly lo w.”  For Mars Pathfinder the rover was to last 
seven days, and it lasted almost  83 days on the surface. Usually  the success metrics set by 
NASA headquarters are set so that unless a major di saster occurs, they can easily be achieved. 
As one engineer so colorfully put it, “It is lik e when you take a test and you hope you get a B on 
the test knowing darn well you’ll get an A, so when you only get a B+, you feel good about 
yourself.”  Therefore, Mars Pathfinder started with defining the success objectives in the mission, 
which were discussed and changed throughout the devel opment phase of the mission, in terms of 
what would constitute a successful demonstrati on of the rover and data return. There were two 
bounds on these success dimension: (1) the lower bound: land on the surface of Mars safely and 
(2) the upper bound: land safely and send back at one panorama, get the rover to function on the 
surface of Mars, and use its instruments to co llect data on a rock. Within these bounds planning 
decisions were made on the basis of risk, budget, and schedule. 
 
Mars Pathfinder 16From the public standpoint, success is how well is it  received in terms of the news media, website 
hits, and the sheer amount of publicity that is generated. One engineer stated that, “Although 
NASA Public Affairs likes to think of the more  long-term metrics of success in public engagement: 
educating teachers and getting information to schools to teach them about space, all it really 
comes down to is, were the people excited at that  point in time?”  Mars Pathfinder received an 
unprecedented amount of media coverage. On the day  of landing, all major television stations 
maintained 24-hour coverage, and every major publication (newspaper and magazine) printed 
stories on this historic event.  The web site se t up by JPL received 7 million hits, shattering all 
records for web hits in 1997. 
 Publicly, Mars Pathfinder was a great success because it was so engaging.  Scientifically its 
success was modest and questionable.  Compared to Mars Global Surveyor, which flew near the 
same time, it was far from a scientific success.  The scientific community, a significant customer 
and stakeholder in the project, would be left with  a reduced amount of data and some of the data 
tagged speculative. The alpha spectrometer had not been properly calibrated resulting in data 
that was very ambiguous. Neither the Germans  nor the University of Chicago tested the 
instrument in a CO
2 rich atmosphere (Mars is 95% CO 2). The instrument wo rks by distributing 
alpha particles, and these particles are either abs orbed or re-radiated by the rock. However, if 
introduced to carbon and oxygen atoms in between the st ream, it alters the flow of the particles.  
The instrument has been repeatedly recalibrated after the fact to reevaluate the results, but to no 
avail. Therefore, all of the data from the al pha spectrometer is suspect. That was the most 
innovative and new science instrument being flow on Mars Pathfinder. 
 
As for Mars Pathfinder and many  NASA projects, a real measure of success is: did it generate 
enough excitement such that Congress recognize s it as a success and get funded next time.  
Thus, by getting funded next time, you’re able to  offer the science community more-ambitious 
projects.   To measure the success of Mars Path finder is also to measure its success with the 
science community. Was the mission conducted l ong enough to allow the science community to 
gather enough data?  On missions such as Mars Pa thfinder, the amount of data should last the 
science community really fifteen or twenty years.   For example, Wayne Lee stated that he knew 
people that had received their Ph.D. analyzing data from the Viking-era missions in 1976. 
 
While Mars Pathfinder worked towards a self-measurement of success that appeared to be 
straight forward, it was what Mars Pathfinder  benchmarked itself against that was harder to 
define.  As with many NASA proj ect post-Apollo, it is really har d for project teams to benchmark 
themselves against something.  Rarely is t here anyone to beat or is anyone doing anything even 
remotely similar.  As with Mars Pathfinder, t hey ultimately benchmarked themselves against what 
they promised, deliver it on schedule, within  budget and with a level of quality data.  One 
benchmark that can be defined is ‘Did we do bette r than last time?’ This is an interesting 
benchmark because sometime there is no last time and in every case you always try to do better 
than last time. Rarely are missions with N ASA repeated identically with the expectation of 
achieving identical results. 
 
Strategic Focus 
 
“If you don’t make quantifiable progress toward t he goal of launching every day and you let very 
many days slip by, you won’t get there.”  - Donna Shirley, Managing Martians , p. 139 
 
Wayne Lee states that most projects  have very little strategic focus. He explains that in the Space 
Shuttle Program there is a program office look ing after the long-term goals and that the missions 
are building on top of each other. In the planetary programs it’s a little different holding programs 
together because of the fact that  launch opportunities do not occur every two or three months like 
Mars Pathfinder 17the Space Shuttle.  For exampl e, a sustained Mars program, wh ich has the most-frequent launch 
opportunities, would only have a launch window ever y 26-27 months (due to celestial mechanics).  
Lee sees this as a challenge in sustaining the interest and support of Congress and the American 
public.   Because the opportunities are so lim ited it becomes hard to get Congress and the 
President to commit to a ten-plus year Mars pr ogram. What has occurred ov er the last ten years 
in the Mars Program with launches every two or three years is unprecedented.  This has not 
occurred since the Sixties when the Cold War fir ed much of America’s space innovation.  Since 
then, it has been a mission (project ) by mission (project) effort.  The large programmatic efforts 
have been restricted because funding limits and agency strategic changes.  As Wayne Lee 
emphasized, “Before, if you were lucky enough to get one mi ssion funded, you counted your 
blessings with that. The programs were almost im possible to sustain becaus e by the time you got 
to the second step of the program it was al ready dead because priorities had changed. Because 
of this trend, planetary projects have had a very project-centric view on strategic goals. It has 
mainly been very tactical. How do I get my project to work tomorrow?” 
 This nonstrategic focus that Lee refers to had to change for Mars Pathfinder to be successful.  
Simply, the strategic focus for everyone was to land a spacecraft on the surface of Mars for a 
budget less than, as Brian Muirhead puts it, “the largest blockbuster movie at the time, 
Waterworld .” The added challenge was that it had to be accomplished on a fixed cost, spacecraft 
plus rover, of about $200 million and within three years.  Given these programmatic constraints 
and the added technical challenge, the strategi c focus needed to be one that could allow people 
to get through this really tough challenge.  D onna Shirley believed this was simplicity.  She 
stated, “Modesty, simplicity were r eally the strategies of Mars Pathfinder.”  All of the managers 
believed in this strategy and Shirley emphasized it simply as, "Keep it simple stupid."  But, that 
did not mean that the project was not challengi ng.  Mars Pathfinder was going to demonstrate 
something that had not been done before under these kinds of constraints. Therefore, Brian 
Muirhead believed they needed a strategi c focus that said, “Take risks,  don’t fail.”   That was the 
behavior that management stressed to  the team.  With a reduction in structure and policy, people 
were allowed to think outside the box and chall enge themselves and the project.  This behavior, 
Muirhead believes, was critical to turning t he Mars Pathfinder competitive advantage into a 
successful project.  To create this relentless pursuit of the competit ive advantage or focus, 
management fostered a focused vision for the projec t and made sure that this vision was part of 
everyone’s approach.  Mars Pathfinder team me mbers believed in the project vision and thus 
became self-directed to achievi ng the strategy.  There was a cl ear linkage between the strategy, 
vision, and objectives.  This made sure that as long as team members understood the objectives 
and were committed to their success, they were  committed to the vision and the strategy.  
Management used regular weekly meetings and adv ice from a peer review committee to stay 
focus on the project strategy and objectives.   Everyone felt accountable and committed. 
 
More specifically, Mars Pathfinder management identified specific ev ents and actions that 
allowed Mars Pathfinder to maintain a strategic focus toward success:  
 Reduced Requirements :  Many requirements were pushed back to drive cost and 
reduce risk.  They felt that this could not be accomplished without a “capabilities driven” 
project.  They believed the capabilities of t he people, hardware, designs, and architecture 
would drive the project to success. 
 Hand-off Top Management :  In order to give Mars Pathfinder management the ability to 
push back requirements and allow people to think differently, they believed top 
management had to stay hands-off.  Giving them  the freedom to do what they felt needed 
to be done, even if it meant breaking the rules. 
 Getting people to think differently : Mars Pathfinder was unlike any project that anyone 
on the project team had worked on before.  Mars Pathfinder management said that 
breaking the traditional mindset of how projects were done was an ongoing challenge. 
Mars Pathfinder 18 Managing risk :  Risk was seen as a distracter to maintaining focus.  When time is 
critical, there can be no time for stopping to adjust for unplanned risk.  To manage risk 
Mars Pathfinder:  attempted to understand ri sk early and develop a mitigation strategy; 
avoid risk with qualified parts, materials (COTS where needed), and process; rigorous testing, and rapid prototyping. 
 High Reliance on the People :  By removing much of the structure, Mars Pathfinder 
believed the people became the f oundation of the project and thus  critical to its success; 
therefore, this meant a foundation built on people’s knowledge, communications skills, 
and commitment. 
 Parallel Processes with more Peer Reviews :  Reviews from technically qualified and 
experienced peers was seen as on of the most si gnificant factors in contributing to Mars 
Pathfinder’s success and maintaining focus. 
 Co-location :  Mars Pathfinder felt this allow ed management to express the strategic 
focus on a constant basis in real-time. 
 End-to-End Design :  People worked the project from beginning to end.  Mars Pathfinder 
believed this kept people focused on the succe ss of the project because they knew they 
would be there in the end; success or failure. 
 
Mars Pathfinder 19Project Spirit and Leadership  
 
“Leaders have to reassure their people that they share the same goals for the final products.” 
– Brian Muirhead, High Velocity Leadership: The Mars Pathfinder Approach , p. 39 
 
Organizational Culture 
 
Due to the shear nature of the constraints pl aced upon Mars Pathfinder, they felt they had to 
invent new ways of doing business, and that becam e part of the culture.  A willingness to take 
risks, but make sure that they were able to  manage those risks. As John Wellman stated, “The 
overall project had taken on a fairly challengi ng goal, so I think there was an understanding that 
we were willing to take some risks on this projec t that we might not ordinarily be taken on some 
missions.” And by virtue of this, an atmos phere was created where people felt or were 
continuously reminded of the common elements of the vision. The management was very 
conscious of the costs and schedule constraints and worked very hard to make decisions that 
would reflect these constraints. Team members re cognized this need, but were not afraid to admit 
and correct bad decisions. They saw management wo rking with them and not for them. They 
believed that they all had to finish this project together.  For example, as Brian Muirhead put it, “It 
wasn’t one subsystem saying: ‘Screw you. I’m going to worry about my budget.’ Everybody 
worried about everybody else. There was a sharing. You know you ta lk about a really great team 
holding each other responsible as much as you hold yourself.  And that’s what we did.”  Each 
member of the Mars Pathfinder team held ever y other member responsible and accountable for 
his or her actions.   
 They each had a deeply rooted, common commitment, purpose and goal.  They were very 
diverse and offered different ages and areas of expertise in science and technology.   They 
expressed care and concern for both the indi viduals and the project.  They had a well-balanced 
task-orientation as well as people-orientation, but  always remembering the super-ordinate goal of 
the mission.  Since they were so accountable for each other, they were relatively self-managed 
with leadership there to provide conti nual support and direction only as needed.   
 
Brian Muirhead best describes the culture of the Mars Pathfinder organization like this:  
 
There was a real sense of people. We stru ctured it in such a way that the people 
that were going to be there at landing we re there during the design. So we made 
sure that people followed all the way through. So people knew they were going to 
be there on landing day. And that was the ke y part of our strategy for keeping the 
cost down. We didn’t build or do a lo t of documentation. We relied on the 
people’s knowledge and experience to be there.  So it really did grow into the 
tightest, most high-spirited group of people I’ve ever worked with. If you ask any 
member of the Pathfinder team, they will say the most special part of it was the 
relationship they had with the other mem bers of the team. And so it was again, 
that’s the definition of a high-perfo rmance team. That’s having a personal 
commitment to the other members of t he team making it. And again this showed 
up at the management level and it became ju st part of the culture all the way 
through.  
 People were more concerned with being honest and meeting the goal, than trying not to “rock the 
boat.” The team enforced “lieutenants,”  these are people who will tell you if you are off target or 
just plain wrong.  There was also no time for so cial loafing. While t hey recognized that each 
individual contribution to the group e ffort was significant, almost without  exception, they  "let go" of 
any member who wasn't doing the job or contributi ng to the team effort.  Every member of the 
team valued their input, took personal owner ship of their responsibilities and understood how 
Mars Pathfinder 20each member played a role in the overall succe ss of the mission.  Me mbers of the team had 
mutual trust and respect for one another and had to be fully competent in his or her domain.  
Donna Shirley stated, "The rest of the group has to  be able to count on you- not just to rely on 
you to do your work well, but also be t here when teammates needed back up.  This meant 
keeping your word, meeting your commitment s, and going public if you needed help or make 
mistakes".   There was a healthy balance between being task-oriented and being people-
oriented.  The idea was to be hard on the iss ues and soft on the people.  That protected the 
relationships, but allowed them to get at the heart of any problems or issues.  
 
Project Spirit 
 
“Mars Pathfinder had more spirit than any mission I’ve ever seen.” 
– Wayne Lee, personal interview 
 
When it comes to the project spirit of Mars Path finder, Donna Shirley likes to give the example of 
the atmosphere in the control room at the day of landing for Mars Pathfinder compared to orbit 
entry for Mars Global Surveyor (MGS).  “I hav e a video I use that shows the Pathfinder on landing 
day in contrast to the MGS team on orbit entry  day. The Pathfinder team is leaping up and down, 
cheering, and hugging. The MGS team applauds, puts on red hats and passes out peanuts. This 
total reflects the personalities of Tony S pear to Glenn Cunningham (MGS Project Manager). 
Glenn Cunningham is very organized, non-emoti onal, business like, good manager. He picked his 
team to basically reflect his personality: very t horough, lots of reviews, follow the rules and make 
it all work. Tony is totally emotionally driven.”  Although both projects are considered success, this 
example is a unique representation of the open spirit of Mars Pathfinder. 
 
Mars Pathfinder believed nurturing and fostering a t eam spirit; therefore, rituals, ceremonies, and 
slogans played a key role in team development.  Some of these events centered on naming. The 
first of these was the naming of the rover.   A contest was held which allowed schoolchildren 
across the country to write essays of what the rover should be named.  Donna Shirley believed 
that a lot of kids at a lot of different schools had fun doing it, and it got the public involved in Mars 
Pathfinder.  The person that won the contest wa s a schoolgirl from Connecticut who was flown 
out to see the launch.  Donna Shirley took a lo t of criticism from N ASA Headquarters for naming 
the rover without going through the normal NASA P ublic Affairs Office procedures.  A second 
naming event was the naming of the rocks the rover encountered.  The first rock the rover came 
to was named Barnacle Bill. It was named Ba rnacle Bill because it had barnacle-looking 
substances on it and so it was sort of tongue in  cheek. But that created some problems when this 
information was released at the press conferenc e and the reasoning for naming the rock Barnacle 
Bill was associated with it appearance and an old r aunchy drinking song.  This did not go over 
well for the straight-laced NASA.  Matt Golombek , Project Scientist, stated that even with the 
minor obstacles the naming of the rocks was a source of fun for the scientists. Now it was not 
rock 3021A, they became Barnacle Bill, Yogi, Scooby-Doo, Matterhorn, and others.  Wayne Lee 
stated that Mars Pathfinder “found ways to take thi ngs out of the rigor of the everyday process of 
NASA’s very straight-laced organization and put some  humanity and some fun into the process.”  
Other naming activities were nicknames.  David Gruel, who created the landing operations 
simulations, was called the Gremlin, and the seven ladies that worked on t he wiring that tied the 
spacecraft together were called the Seven Dwarfs.  Donna Shirley also believed that just as the 
Apollo program had a motto man, moon, decade , so should Mars Pathfinder, so she coined soil, 
rock, lander . 
 
Another key activity that was entertaining for t he team, and would later become critical for Mars 
Pathfinder’s success was the creating of test ca ses for the operations simulation.  An Entry 
Decent and Landing (EDL) group created what they call the “Mother of All Simulations,” which 
was used to design the whole EDL system. When har dware was delivered for this simulation, it 
Mars Pathfinder 21was a big deal. The team invited the whole project team to come to the place where the hardware 
was delivered.  Everybody gathered around, took pictures, and later c opies of the pictures were 
distributed amongst the team. 
 The abundance of time spent together, the relatively  small number of members in the group, the 
challenge and constraints posed by external fact ors and those who did not believe in their 
potential success, all these forces contributed to the team’s strong cohesiv eness.  They all lived 
in close proximity and worked, and talked and play ed together daily.  They had a great sense of 
pride and team spirit. Good communications and co-location helped build the team, as did an 
atmosphere of open communication and shared space help build human relationships.  Tony Spear, Project Manager, and some of the other m anagers, every so often would declare a happy 
hour and at four o’clock on Friday members of the team would go out  for drinks.  This activity 
became a festive event that helped develop camaraderie.  John Wellman stated that there was 
even a group that got involved in a once a week trail hike. This continued for a year and a half 
over the life of the project.   At the end of the project about ten of the regular hikers climbed Mt. 
Whitney.  
 
Policy to Support Strategy and Spirit 
 
Traditionally at JPL projects function as line organizations, people in specific line organizations 
will not perform tasks outside of their line organizati on.  Mars Pathfinder believed that that had to 
change, the policy had to change.  They felt that  anyone from any organization, as long as they 
had the right mind-set, could do any job.  For the first time ever, navigators whose job was to 
track data from outer space and perform the mat hematics to calculate the spacecraft location 
were working in the test beds. By doing so , they got a new-found appreciation of how the 
spacecraft operated, and as Wayne Lee stated, “I th ink were able to do their jobs better.”  The 
traditional policy would have never permitted thes e crossing responsibilities.  Wayne Lee believes 
that if you get the right quality person, y ou can train them to do most tasks, and in an 
interdisciplinary environment this becomes very efficient and helpful. 
 In addition, the co-location of mu ch of the staff allowed for the crossing of line organizations and 
as one manager described, “I think the fact that  everybody was there as  an integrated cohesive 
unit as a team, doing something new, really contribut ed to the high-level spirit that I was able to 
observe on the mission.  That was something very  unique.”  The idea of co-location fostered less 
formal and more immediate interactions bet ween management-levels. John Wellman described it, 
“You know, I’d be sitting in my office and Tony S pear, the project manager would yell in the hole, 
‘Wellman, get in here!’ And I’d walk into his offi ce and next thing you know we’d be in a meeting. 
So it wasn’t a matter of scheduling it for a week from Tuesday, it was pretty immediate.”  Mars 
Pathfinder believed that co-location allowed them  to solved problems in real time rather than 
scheduling or waiting for the monthly reviews or t he weekly status meetings  to get the work done. 
Wellman contributes this more than anything else to keeping the project on a tight schedule. Mars 
Pathfinder also contributes co-location to developing an intimate team.  
 
Brian Muirhead said that you have to have a polic y (or lack of policy) that will allow you the 
freedom to be creative about how you do your job. He  believed that is rea lly the hallmark of being 
successful, and if you do not have the freedom to  be creative and the constraints are really 
impossible, you will probably not succeed.  
Leadership 
 
The management was instrumental to the overall success of the Mars Pathfinder mission.  Mars 
Pathfinder leadership believed leaner staffs, minimal overhead, empowerment of the people and 
a willingness to do things in new ways. From the beginning, the leadership believed in their team 
Mars Pathfinder 22and believed they enjoyed work as naturally as pl ay.  They believed they were capable of self-
direction and could be motivated and responsib le enough to achieve the mission's goal. Manager 
Brian Muirhead clearly states the key factor to the success of the projec t was the people.  They 
consistently exhibited their commi tment to the goals and all of their actions were in line with the 
goals.  They believed in being an example to the rest of the team and believed leadership begins 
at the top, and so does team spirit.  The l eadership had a clear vision, and backed up its words 
with actions.  
The Mars Pathfinder management understood that di fferent circumstances called for different 
types of leadership.  As Donna Shirley believed that  sometimes you have to let your team rely on 
their own abilities; the management team also believed that, as Brian Muirhead states, “…a 
manager must confidently reach into a projec t to move it forward.” They empowered the 
employees by giving them access to informat ion that normally only a leader would have.  
Individuals became more empowered to make dec isions when they had access to information 
necessary to make those decisions.  The leaders used whichever style best fit the situation that 
arose during the project.  At times they were parti cipatory, or delegating, selling, or telling.  For 
the most part, they were participat ing.  The leadership primarily provided support and direction.  If 
the circumstances dictat ed, the leadership was there to make a final decision and move with it. 
They believed the most successful  leaders learn to channel their energy, focus it, and use it to 
energize their people.  The Mars Pathfinder leadership understood they were dealing with a 
talented team and did not need to micro-manage.  The manager is there to help the people and 
guide them in becoming a cohesive unit, and at times must confidently reach into a project to help 
move it forward towards the achievement of the goal.  
 The leadership on Mars Pathfinder worked to create an atmosphere of trust and openness 
between the employees and management, and the team felt that the management team reflected 
a very tight, focused group.  They believed in making the people, not the policy, responsible to 
the organization.  This instilled a sense of belonging in the team.  Younger people dominated the 
leadership for Mars Pathfinder with a can-do sp irit. They believed that things could be done 
differently and the way things have always been done is not always conducive to getting the job 
done effectively.  As one engineer stated, “Som etimes the older engineers who may become line 
managers get very set in their ways, and believe you have to do things this way because that’s 
the way we did things before.”  One engineer felt  that when you get a lot of managers working in 
a collocated environment you don’t always have to  report back to the line because you’re not 
sitting with your line manager everyday; therefore,  “you’re able to bend the institutional rules a 
little bit and get things done efficiently in this can-do spirit kind of way.” 
 
Management for Mars Pathfinder carried a level of re spect from the team as well.  As Wayne Lee 
stated “You never want to get project manager s who have never been in the rubber-meets-the-
road situation. They have never  faced the pointed edge of the sw ord. Yes, they can shuffle 
viewgraphs around but they’re not really gonna be t hat effective.” The team members of Mars 
Pathfinder felt respect and confidence in the management.  As one engineer put it, “If you went 
up to a manager and asked if you could do such-and-such because we’re having a hard time with 
math and schedules, budget, the project manager understood and said I was in your position 
before, I understand why you need to sacrifice this.”  
 
Team Empowerment 
 
Mars Pathfinder believed that the people not  the management or the technology made the 
project; therefore, the team was empowered to be decision makers.  Brian Muirhead states that 
because the project was moving fast and the budget wa s so tight, they really did rely on people’s 
individual effort or contribution.  This instilled a sense of ownership and responsibility in the team.  
People felt the responsibility and personal integrit y.  Everybody believed they had a key part in 
Mars Pathfinder 23the success of the project, whether they were  a technician on the floor tightening a bolt or 
someone working on the simulation of the entry , descent and landing. As Brian Muirhead said, 
“Everyone understood that we were one failure away from disaster.” Brian Muirhead believed that 
if people feel like they own it, y ou’re going to get the performance.  
 
Mars Pathfinder had to make decisions rapidl y and they were breaking new ground in some 
areas; therefore, management felt that people at  all levels had to be empowered to do creative 
thinking, make decisions and follow up on them in order to move the project at a much faster 
pace than was normal. Donna Shirley described it  by saying, “When you are managing really 
brilliant people, at some point you find it is almost impossible to command or control them 
because you can’t always understand what they  are doing.  Once they’ve gone beyond your 
ability to understand them, then you have to make a choice as a manager.  You can limit them 
and the project by your intelligence (which I thin k is the wrong way), or you can trust them and 
use your management skills to keep them focused on the goal”.   
 Mars Pathfinder management believed that knowledge was key to empowerment.  They felt that 
individuals became empowered to make decisions  because they had access to information once 
available only to managers.  Therefore, they m ade sure that individuals had access to as much 
information as possible.   
 
Mars Pathfinder 24Organization  
 
Project Organization 
 
With many NASA projects, they can become huge bureaucratic monoliths.  Wayne Lee states 
that in many NASA projects people are empowered to do their own tasks, but you are not really 
empowered to help make strategic decisions. Ma rs Pathfinder tried something very novel and 
unique to most of NASA.  It employed some of t he traditional characteristic of the skunk works 
paradigm.  At JPL, traditionally projects were set up as line organizations with project members 
reporting and sitting with their line management. Pr oject integration would have to overcome 
multiple management lines and locations.  Mars Pa thfinder recognized these as limitations in 
order to achieve their constrained objectives.  As one engineer stated, “The only way that people 
from different lines interact together is almost never.”   To overcome this the Mars Pathfinder 
management secured an entire building and t hey brought everybody from those line 
organizations into that building and relocat ed everybody into one location (about 200 or 300 
people). They covered two floors of the building,  creating a tight close-knit atmosphere where 
everybody was readily available.  As Wayne Lee stated, “You just had to walk down the hall to 
resolve a problem and that was a very efficient way to do things.”

Structure 
 
Mars Pathfinder believed in keeping the team sm all and thus keeping the organization flat. It was 
about eight project element managers who worked di rectly for the project manager with a team 
underneath them. There was almost no hierarch y, and in most areas the group was only one 
deep with no one person backing up an engineer or scientist.  The team was designed to be small so it could function not as  a group, but as a “high performance team.”  There was a reliance 
on a small core team with individual subsys tem engineers to bridge interfaces, improve the 
understanding of the overall system and establish relationships with the JPL technical divisions 
and aerospace community.  They believed that a flat organization could empower the people who 
were doing the work. The challenge as Donna Shirle y put it was that “…with flat organizations 
you can have inexperienced people trying to do the work with no one coaching them or mentoring 
them.”   Donna Shirley believed that if you have a team of more that seven people it is going have 
a completely different dynamic than a team that is seven or smaller.  People are able to avoid 
becoming decision-makers in teams of more than se ven.  Therefore, the t eams within the project 
structure were kept small. 
 The co-location and flat organization allowed fo r issues to be addressed real-time and across 
functional areas.  John Wellman stated that as  manager for the payload, when he had a problem 
down in the lab, he would go down there and roll up his sleeves and pitch in with whatever 
needed to be done.  
 
Team Assembly 
 
“Build a team of different ages and experience.” 
  - Donna Shirley, Managing Martians , p. 148 
  
Mars Pathfinder management believed as Brian Muirhead put it, ”Build a team of generalist, 
people who are not limited in scope to the confines of  the work they were trained in or are most 
experienced at, but who have the interest and ab ility to work beyond the limitations of their 
resume’.”  They tried to put together the best techni cal team that they coul d with a combination of 
experience and inexperience.  Since Mars Path finder was not considered a large project, by 
NASA standards, people were consumed by the bigger projects. Therefore, experienced 
personnel were hard to come by.  The team  was dominated by youth. Brian Muirhead even 
commented that he “felt like the old man at 42.”  Most of t he people on the team had not done the 
job they were assigned to do, it required learning t he job as they went along.  Some saw this as 
helpful in that it did not limit their perspective. Mars Pathfinder had to take a multi-discipline team 
and innovate.  Donna Shirley described it as, “You get the best people you can, and then you 
mush the organization around to fit the people.”  
 With the limitation of not being able to select from a large talent force, Brian Muirhead learned 
that it is best to work just a few people s hort of enough.  Without the draw from the line 
organizations, which usually dictated the number of people required for a job, Mars Pathfinder 
was able to select only the number of people they felt was appropriate.  Because of this, Mars 
Pathfinder would find people within JPL that had the energy, the drive and then do their best to 
nurture them along. Sometimes this meant having a relatively inexperienced staff, but as they 
demonstrated their abilities they were assigned more  significant responsibilities.  Brian Muirhead 
believed in making people stretch by putting them in jobs they were not “qualified” for by 
experience, but that he felt they could handle.  To support this he found strong “lieutenants,” 
people who would tell you when things were off ta rget or just plain wrong.  Someone like Tom 
Revilini who was responsible for the airbag syst em was a perfect example of a typical Mars 
Pathfinder team member. At the time no one had ev er successfully built an airbags system for 
Mars Pathfinder 26landing before. Because of the immense engineering difficulty with trying to model the system 
through computer simulations, it had to be done empirically.  The time and effort to design the 
airbag system empirically took a lot of energy  and drive of the individual in charge. Brian 
Muirhead described Tom this way, “You could have had a really brilliant person, but they couldn’t 
have done a job like that. Tom’s a pretty sharp guy, too, but it was his ener gy that really pulled 
that job off. And I think overall we had a lot of really smart people that came to Pathfinder.”  
 When selecting members for the Mars Pathfi nder, team management wanted people that were 
going to be with the project from beginning to end.  This meant being able to reduce the turnover 
of key technical personnel, and the ability to identify qualified staff early and foresee any 
organizational problems.  Mars Pathfinder management  realized that this poised a risk of staff 
burnout and limiting someone’s career mobility.   Although management had to look hard for 
people to fill some unique positions for Mars Pathfinder, in some cases it was almost self-
selected. A lot of people came because they heard about the project.  At the time, people at JPL 
were contrasting Pathfinder to Cassini, a major ‘fl agship’ mission with very formal classic project 
architecture. When people heard about the kinds of opportunities people were getting, the kind of 
responsibility and authority they had, people were  asking to be part of the project.   
 While youth and inexperience seemed to dominate Mars Pathfinder, it maintained a level of 
experienced scientists and engineers to keep the pr oject focused and directed.  Wayne Lee best 
described it as, “I think a lot of the older engineers probably are among the smartest people within 
NASA, primarily because they had to learn their sk ills in the days when we didn’t have computers. 
Nowadays, all engineers grow up going through college with computer simulations. It’s actually 
pretty bad because what happens is you get somebody  fresh out of college that has no intuition 
and you tell them, well how did you find that answe r. ‘Well the computer told me.’ Well how do 
you know the computer’s right? They don’ t know how to think for themselves.” 
 
Responsibilities 
 
In order to manage how responsibilities were allocated with Mars Pathfinder, management put the power in the team.  Mars Pathfinder practi ced what they called “Soft Projectization.”  It 
became an institutional idea where rather than having the line organization responsible for the 
delivery of a subsystem, they had a Projec t Element Managers who came out of the line 
organization and reported directly to the projec t manager. This project element manager was then 
responsible and accountable for their subsystem; in addition, they took complete ownership of the 
delivery of a particular subsystem. The empow erment of the Project Element Managers became 
a very efficient way to manage Mars Pathfinder.  
 By empowering the Project Element Managers with  the responsibility of ownership for their 
subsystem, management wanted people in this pos ition who were technically competent and 
could be close to the action of their subsyste ms. One of the reasons for this was so when 
problems came up, the time to resolve any issues  could be limited. Management  felt that this was 
critical during a compressed schedule.  
 But just as the team was empowered with the responsibility to make decisions, management felt 
they were just as responsible for making sure the engineers and scient ist got the help they 
needed.  John Wellman felt that when the science instruments had to be calibrated, and those 
operations had to be staffed around the clock, he would take a shift along with the engineers and 
scientist to make sure the work got done on sc hedule.  Although this is a common occurrence on 
many project, Mars Pathfinder believed that it happened to a greater degree with their project. 
 
 
Mars Pathfinder 27Top Management Involvement 
 
Mars Pathfinder believed that commitment begins at the top.  They saw top management as a 
champion for Mars Pathfinder and important to su staining its success.  T he commitment of Mars 
Pathfinder was received from the director of JP L but the project received its true champion in 
Wes Huntress, Space Science Associate Admini strator. Wes wanted to see the Discovery 
Program be successful, so he selected Mars Pathfinder because he believed it could be successful.  With Wes’ support, it kept the mission going and gave the project a funding profile 
that could be worked.  
 Mars Pathfinder believed top management s hould be kept informed but has a limited 
involvement.  Mars Pathfinder believed that they  were successful because they were left alone.  
Mark Saunders, Discovery Program Manager, believ ed that and made sure that Mars Pathfinder 
had that freedom.  They did not get a lot of help fr om others.  As Brian Muirhead said, “A lot of 
people kind of stood back and said ‘Oh my God, those guys are scary.’” 
 
Professional Advice and Reviews 
 
To perform reviews they relied a lot on outside consultants. This was something Tony Spear 
believed in and made a significant part of the budget.  Many of the Mars Pathfinder team felt that 
the project was over reviewed, and felt that the formal reviews (PDR, CDR) that are once a year 
are enough to achieve success. But, everyone on t he team did understand that the true value in 
the review was the preparation. Tony Spear worked hard to make sure that the outside review 
board was a formal, very competent board that would work to keep the team honest. The board 
members consisted of technical people with recen t, directly applicable, subsystem experience.  
These reviewers were selected based on their know ledge of what questions to ask, how to probe 
issues, and when an answer was satisfactory.  Br ian Muirhead said this was important because 
as they prepared for those reviews they knew they were going to be pretty tough; therefore, being 
able to understand the system and be able to  communicate it well was critical. 
 
Organizational Problems 
 
“Only when there was a dispute of a problem that the team could not solve,  they should turn to 
me.” 
- Donna Shirley, Managing Martians , p. 149 
 
While problem-solving was common, conflict was no t.  However, when conflict did arise it was 
usually handled within the team.  Only when there wa s a dispute of a problem that the team could 
not solve, did they turn to management. One of  the biggest or the toughest problems as Brian 
Muirhead stated was with individuals. He believ ed that some people do not always fit into an 
organization either because they do not have the skill, the drive, or  the attitude. An example of 
this was a story that Brian Muirhead tells,  
 
“There was early on one guy who was our parachute lead guy, who I just didn’t 
trust. And we had to get rid of him. And so  probably over the course of the project 
we changed out about 10 percent of the sta ff, just for reasons of they didn’t – 
well, most of the time it wasn’t a matter of skill, they just didn’t fit in with the 
environment. You know, they liked more form alism or they just weren’t willing to 
commit, make that personal commitment to pulling this project off on the 
schedule within the cost.”   
Mars Pathfinder 28Even with its problems, Mars Pathfinder believ ed that there was a culture in which, when a 
problem came up, it was communicated quickly so all elements of the project were aware of it. 
This applied to organizational problems and resource problems.   
 
Training 
 
Aside from regular training that team members had received through the course of their career, 
no one received any training outside of on-the-job trai ning during the course of the project.  Most 
everyone on the project had a four year degree and some advanced. Few had any formal 
management training.  Once the project was star ted, it was rapid-paced, and there was no time 
for training.  For some this meant some pretty qui ck learning, reviewing archival test results (e.g. 
Viking), and getting out and meeting the people who did know how to design certain systems. 
Therefore, the technical learning became on-the-job or real-life crash courses. 
 
Mars Pathfinder 29Processes  
 Project Phases and Reviews 
 For Mars Pathfinder, at the project level the m anagers looked at three basic milestones: Critical 
Design Review (CDR); the start of Assembly  Test and Launch Operations (ATLO); and the 
launch date.  CDR is when the design is believed to  be set and ATLO is when it is believed that 
spacecraft assembly is ready.  The launch date for a planetary flight project remains fixed 
because of the alignment of the planets, so that cannot be changed.   Therefore, from project 
inception, the project end date is set.  The only two opt ions are to cancel the project or delay it by 
years. For Mars Pathfinder everything follow ed on a set schedule from CDR to ATLO to launch 
date. Management gauged their progress and ri sks against meeting these three major 
milestones.  These major milestones drove Mars Pathfinder through development.  Brian 
Muirhead said that the biggest challenge in dev elopment was getting to the launch pad within 
budget.  Management knew that if they blew the budget the project would be canceled.  Everyone 
on the team felt this perception. Brian Muirhead took it upon himself to make sure that the 
schedule was maintained.  He used it to track people and a way of controlling costs. 
 Clark and Oberhettinger state in their repor t on the NASA Lessons Learned Database that, 
 
A JPL study of in-flight problems on Voyager I and II, Magellan, and Galileo 
revealed that 40% would likely have been identified by better technical 
penetration in reviews of the detailed des igns performed well before launch.  An 
additional 40% (for a total of 80%) mi ght also have been found by similar in-
depth reviews.  Because of this JPL adopt ed the informal peer review process in 
order to ensure that technical pers onnel qualified to adequately interrogate the 
designs obtained the appropriate level of penetration. 
 
This commitment to the design reviews was attr ibuted to reducing the uncertainty.  Management 
for Mars Pathfinder felt that they received mo re reviews than, ”anybody  even had any right to 
even think about.”  Mars Pathfinder was submitted to about a hundred peer reviews on all of the 
subsystems in addition to the standard prelimi nary design (PDR) and critical design reviews 
(CDR). Although, the amount of internal review within JPL was not as high as compared to a 
flagship class mission (e.g. Cassini), there was st ill a fair amount of review from the headquarters 
side.    
Aside from the formal PDR and CDR, Mars Path finder placed a lot of emphasis on informal 
reviews comprised of in-depth discussions of requirements and designs.  Mars Pathfinder saw 
the formal reviews at a verification of the proj ect status and attainment of milestones while the 
informal reviews featured detailed value-added engineering analysis, problem solving, and peer 
review.  The formal reviews were used as the gates in the development process. But, as Brian 
Muirhead stated, “they aren’t crisp gates.” Traditi onally the preliminary design is complete at 
PDR, which gives approval to go into detail desi gn. Then when the CDR is completed, approval is 
given to go into fabrication. For Mars Pathfi nder this traditional approach could not work. Brian 
Muirhead stated that this not only did not work on Mars Pathfinder, but also would not work on 
most projects today; “there are just too many parallel threads.”  Therefore, the CDR becomes the 
point when a fair amount of the design has  been completed, and hardware has already been 
committed in other areas. Brian Muirhead describes it  as a “rolling wave,” or a “moving target.”  
For Mars Pathfinder the schedules drove when y ou needed transition and not the design reviews.   
 
 
 
Mars Pathfinder 30Communications 
 
“To make it work, you have to design your comm unications system just like you design everything 
else and manage it.”  - Donna Shirley, personal interview 
 
Communications were critical to moving Mars Pathfinder successfully forward in its project 
development.  Many of the Mars Pathfinder team attr ibutes things like co-location, email, hallway 
conversations, and focused meetings to their communications success.  Brian Muirhead placed a 
lot of value on face-to-face communication and thus attempted to co-locate as many of the Mars 
Pathfinder team as possible.  This created an environment where decisions could be made in 
real-time or by walking down the hall or to the nex t floor.  Many critical, timely decisions were 
made when two people crossed paths in the hall. Donna Shirley shared this belief, but believed 
that co-location, although important, became impossible as the team began to grow and not 
everyone was full-time. Donna Shirley felt that in the BFC modality, Mars Pathfinder was the 
smallest team that could have full-time peopl e, and in a BFC world, collocation becomes 
impossible because you will be limited on full-time people.  Donna Shirley stated that the rover 
team was not co-located at all, and that she was the only person in the Mars Pathfinder area. She 
overcame this with weekly meetings, emails , and making people come together to put the rapid 
prototypes together. Electronic communication (e.g. email) was a major contribution to the Mars 
Pathfinder team overcoming any co-location issues, as  there was a fair amount of email traffic.   
 
Another valuable communication mechanism was meetings, but not how many or when they 
occurred but how they were conduc ted.  Meetings were kept s hort (sometimes only 15 minutes), 
to the point, and offered the opportunity for team members to address issues or concerns.  Some 
meetings had nothing on the agenda, but all meetings  included a set of questions that were the 
framework for the meeting and centered on budge t, schedule, and major programmatic issues 
and changes.  Some of these questions included: 
 
• What are we going to accomplish today? 
• Does everybody know what  they are supposed to do? 
• Does anyone have a communication problem with anyone else? 
• Are there any other issues? 
 
Decision-making meetings were kept small, where the number of people making decisions was 
relatively small, to prevent the room from sub-dividing into smaller groups.  Donna Shirley had 
weekly status reports and regular Monday morni ng meetings to keep everyone focused and Brian 
Muirhead had two leadership meetings per  week: (1) management (2) systems. 
 
Another mechanism by which communication was fostered was in the development of 
documentation.  Mars Pathfinder made the person who generated a document (e.g. 
requirements, change-control processes, drawi ngs) be the owner of it, and when there was a 
change needed to the document, that person had to be par t of the interface to make the changes.  
This required a lot of face-to-face and direct communication between all affected parties.  Brian 
Muirhead described that “Sometimes there’s an in termediary, like a syst ems guy who’s kind of 
the glue, the between two subsystems, say bet ween mechanical and attitude control or those 
which have significant relationships such as propulsion and attitude control. Rather than have a 
systems guy between them, we let those two organi zations really work out the issues between 
them.”  This is why Mars Pathfinder searched for people t hat had a systems mentality. 
 
 
Mars Pathfinder 31Resource Management 
 
In some respects Mars Pathfinder followed the standard approach to resource estimation at JPL: 
(1) the initial budget for the project is defined by headquarters, (2) then a bottom-up layout of the 
schedule and staffing, (3) and then a bottom-up costing.  For Mars Pathfinder, this quickly 
showed that there were not adequate reserves for the project. This triggered some major 
reevaluation and descoping very early on in the proj ect in order to get the baseline, estimated 
costs low enough to get adequate reserves within the co st cap. This resulted in decisions such as 
not using a rocket-assisted descent, and lessening a very ambitious science payload. From this 
point, reserves were then distributed out to the subsystems and Tony Spears kept some 
additional reserves at the overall project level.  Each subsystem manager had to keep track of his 
or her own budgets and schedules with an informal  earned-value system to track performance. 
 
During the project, Mars Pathfinder believed that resources were part of the entire project and not 
the sole possession of any subsystem.  Donna Shir ley stated that Mars Pathfinder believed in the 
sharing of resources whenever possible.  One wa y to do this was through a barter system.  This 
was done routinely between the rover and lander proj ects (e.g. mass).  Another was relinquishing 
parts of a budget from one subsystem to another to guarantee project success.  In some cases 
subsystems willing transferred funds or reserv es to support other s ubsystems. Brian Muirhead 
described it as, “Most of the time subsystems , once they have a budget, they guard it jealously. 
And if they have any extra money  in there you don’t see it. When they have a problem of course 
they’re coming to you for reserves. But there were  actually times when projects with subsystem 
elements like propulsion said, ‘You know I don’t need this two or three hundred thousand dollars 
this month. You guys over in the electronics area, I know you’re str uggling. Here, you can have it.’  
Ground system guys gave the fli ght system guys money, which is unheard of.”  John Wellman 
stated that he ended up transferring nearly two million do llars of reserves – out of a total of $15 
million for his whole effort – to the spacecraft to  help solve problems. This  was the situation in 
many of the subsystems.  The data systems t eam relinquished some reserve early on to help 
solve technical problems on the spacecraft side.  As Wellman continued to state, “I won’t say it 
was cheerfully done always, but those kinds of  adjustments were made without a lot of 
recrimination and it was done successfully.” 
 
Mars Pathfinder did not believe in being restrained about setting up reserves. Mars Pathfinder 
maintenance of large reserves when it was initially  started was recognized as critical to solving 
problems. Therefore, when problem s were identified the team tri ed to assess the cost impact and 
then a change control board did the allocation of re serves to those problems, with first-level 
managers sitting on this board. Three reserves were established that they be lieved were critical 
to their success: budget, schedule, and mass.  T he Mars Pathfinder team had a commitment to 
the cost and schedule constraints of the project.  As stated before, t hese constraints and the 
commitment to those constraints was part of t he culture and vision.  Therefore, people were 
willing and encouraged to share and give resources. 
 
Aside from the Mars Pathfinder resource management and subsystems, universities developed 
the science instruments for Mars Pathfinder.  To maintain budget, when the science experiments/instruments were se lected they were cost-capped.  This meant that they were 
unable to spend any more money than they pr oposed to accomplish the task. John Wellman 
believed that the science principle investigators (PI) recognized t hat their credibility and ability to 
propose for future missions rested on their ability to  demonstrate that they could deliver on cost 
and on schedule.  Historically, once a winning proposal was granted to a university, the 
negotiation efforts with the projects were star ted and budgets were a moving target.   For Mars 
Pathfinder, the science content and the budgets were  frozen early, allowing for success later in 
the project.  
 
Mars Pathfinder 32Reducing Uncertainty 
 
“If you can’t afford the time or the money to build  with the goal of perfecti on, then test the hell out 
of every piece of hardware and software.” 
- Brian Muirhead, High Velocity Leadership: The Mars Pathfinder Approach , p. 74 
 
Every team member of Mars Pathfinder will sa y that the key to reducing the technological and 
requirements uncertainty was to freeze design early  and test.  To freeze the design process early, 
Mars Pathfinder pressed for very early deliverie s. Rather than do extens ive trade-off studies and 
analyses, Mars Pathfinder moved rapidly from pr ototyping to the engineering model stage.  If it 
worked, the design for the flight was chosen and an extensive amount of test time scheduled to 
drive out any problems.  
 
Brian Muirhead felt that testing was even part of t he vision. He explains, “We were going to test 
this thing very aggressively, end to end, as many times as we can, testing every aspect of it 
because it’s a single-string machine. You know  one failure in one part or one component could 
take out the whole mission. And everybody knew that.”   Mars Pathfinder had a significant amount 
of risk associated with it simple because it was a single-string spacecraft; there was no backup.  The lander that was built was the only one, and the rover only had some back-up parts.  That’s 
where the testing came in. Mars Pathfinder put in  twice as many hours testing the spacecraft as 
anybody thought was needed. All of the management felt that rigor ous and extensive testing was 
even part of the culture.  
 
An example of this was The Gremlin.  David Greuel (a.k.a. The Gremlin) was tasked with creating 
scenarios for operational readiness tests.  Duri ng test, The Gremlin would set up pathological 
cases in The Sandbox (Mars surface simulation) of the test bed area. A nd the team would have 
to use the telemetry and the imaging they got from  the Rover to figure out the problem and figure 
out how to get out of it. This would entail going through a sequence of activities just like it could 
occur during landing. This would mean that t he software and hardware was simulating what the 
spacecraft would see, and the team was in thei r operational readiness conditions. They were at 
the consoles and they were driving the rover just  like they were on Mars.  Tests were performed 
on real clock time with communications delays from  Mars. One test started at two o’clock in the 
morning and worked twenty-four hours a day for five days. This became invaluable. The first time 
this was performed the team crashed and burned.  
 Mars Pathfinder dealt with challenges that not all planetary missions encounter, landing on Mars.   
Most missions that are designed come within close proximity of a planet, but landing is very hard.  
One of the biggest challenges is that you cannot test that under realistic conditions on Earth. 
Gravity and atmospheric density are almost im possible to reproduce.  It would require a 
significant amount of money to test anything under the same conditions it would encounter on 
Mars. This required a heavy reliance on computer si mulation and testing at the assembly level.  
For example, the testing of the O-shell to  handle the heating, the parachutes to handle the 
dynamic pressure and deployment, the rockets fo r the final deceleration, and the airbag for 
impact were all tested individually, but tied together  with computer models to optimize for end-to-
end solutions. With limited budgets many worst-case  scenarios could not be performed for fear of 
damaging any equipment that was too co stly to replace. Therefore, in many situations, especially 
with the entry, decent, and landing phase, probab ilistic solutions were found. As Wayne Lee 
described, “We did tens of thousands  of Monte Carlo runs to come up with a suite of performance 
parameters that would give us a high probabilit y of success and allow each of the components to 
work.  As John Wellman described, “There was less of  a sense of “Let’s consider seven options 
for this one” and spend a month studying them all, but it was a matter of having to choose the one 
or two and proceeding on that course. If we pick ed the wrong directions we’d have to go back and 
Mars Pathfinder 33make a change of direction later on, but we couldn’ t afford to agonize over lots of decisions for 
long periods of time and still stay on schedule.”   
Systems Engineering 
 
Mars Pathfinder believed they had a reasonably str ong system engineering effort.  To ensure this 
people were devoted to working across subsyste ms. Brian Muirhead believed that every one of 
his project element managers was a systems engi neer and a very tight team.  Because the 
project management had a system engineering mindse t, people were not afraid to be a systems 
engineer or think like a systems engineer. Brian Muirhead purposely sought people for his 
management positions that had the mentality of systems engineering.  He considered himself a 
systems engineer.  Therefore, there was a short path between systems engineering and 
management, and everyone shared the system ownersh ip as well as the programmatic issues 
that went along.   
Besides assuring the management had a systems engineering mentality, Mars Pathfinder took an 
innovative approach to the require ment documentation to make sure that systems engineering 
mentality was intertwined throughout the life of  the project.   Brian Muirhead explains,  
 
“We had a younger systems engineers w ho was kind of the guru for the 
requirements documents; we grew him in  that role. Now typically when the 
requirements document’s are done, you get  rid of those guys and bring on the 
test guys.  What we did is let this guy , follow through. He did the requirements; 
let’s see him be the lead tester. That’s  a job he hasn’t done before, but again he 
grew into it and was very, very efficient. He knew how this thing was supposed to 
work. So he became the test director. Then he moved on into operations to become one of the flight directors. So it was a great growth opportunity, again 
part of the culture.”    
 Mars Pathfinder believed that having people work “c radle to grave” also reduced the uncertainty.  
Mars Pathfinder also believed that by allowing people to all phases of the projects development 
addressed many of the issues associated with integration. They had a very carefully planned 
integration test activity, which of course went  though many iterations and modifications, but all 
components saw a lot of test time with the spac ecraft.  Mars Pathfinder was a very well tested 
system when it launched.  Brian Muirhead lived by t he motto: “You test as you fly, you fly as you 
test.”  
 Risk Management 
 
“Well the way you take risks and don’t fail is you hav e enormous license to do things differently.” 
 - Brian Muirhead, personal interview 
 
This statement by Brian Muirhead was a large s ense of the vision that  the management instilled 
in the team. They wanted a new way of doing bus iness, technically and programmatically, which 
would allow them to get the job done. Design i t, build it, and operate it within the specified 
constraints, because they believed it coul d never be done by the traditional techniques.  
Therefore, risk was a significant factor.  Not onl y was a high level of risk inherent in the project 
because of the technological challenges, but also  on the way the project was to be managed.  
Donna Shirley stated that with risk management  the project used many of the standard 
techniques and a lot of testing, but credits Tony  Spear with really doing a good job with Mars 
Pathfinder.  Mars Pathfinder built things ear ly and then tested them. They had the system 
integrated and going into test with 40% of their resources still left. When they found things they 
Mars Pathfinder 34were able to fix them. As Donna Shirley expl ained, “Other missions like Cassini, do systems 
engineering on the front end with a lot of require ments and create a big paper trail. Tony could 
not afford that. We had requirements documents, but  they were not as large as other projects. 
Most of our decisions were made by rapid prototyp ing. As you put something together you test it; 
it either works or it doesn't, and then you write your documents based on the testing.” 
 
Customer Involvement 
 
Mars Pathfinder believed that you rely on cust omers, not executives, for setting a project’s 
strategic direction; although, in some instances these were the same.  Mars Pathfinder had three 
customers: NASA, the Science Community, and the Public.  Any NASA proj ect has itself as a 
customer.  This usually is N ASA Headquarters or the Program Offi ce for which the project is 
being funded.  Donna Shirley described it as, “If you have a commercial customer, you have to do 
market research or you have to find out what is selling. In the case of government projects there 
is really not any money changing hands, so you hav e to represent the person that represents the 
taxpayers. In this case is was Murray Hu rshbine (Program Manager at NASA Headquarters).”  
NASA Headquarters was the most heavily involved cu stomer in terms of monitoring on a monthly 
basis, keeping track of progress, performanc e against schedule, budget, and risk. Therefore, 
there was a direct involvement.  
 
The second customer was the scient ific community that the projec t supported.  The role of the 
scientific community for Mars Pathfinder was view ed as an important customer.  Mars Pathfinder 
was very aware that not only did they have to land on Mars and have a functioning spacecraft 
that could transmit pictures, those pictures and the other scientific dat a had to have scientific 
merit to justify a reasonable scientific program and to generate real scientific results.  Unlike past 
NASA missions the scientific data from Mars Path finder was readily available to the scientific 
community almost in real-time.  
 
With the public it was the scientific knowledge, t he excitement and that sens e of participation that 
made Mars Pathfinder a success. As Mars Pathfinder approached launch, there was a heavier involvement from NASA and JPL Public Affairs O ffices.  These offices coordinated getting the 
press kits together, arranging the viewing sites,  keeping the press involved, and running the press 
conferences; this continued through the cruise phase and landing.  The pictures coming from 
Mars Pathfinder were available to the public wi thin a few hours of when they arrived on Earth.  
 One philosophy that Mars Pathfinder believed with every one of their customers was to be truthful 
with them in the front end.  Eliminate any surp rises and let them know exactly what to expect, 
good or bad.  Mars Pathfinder had working groups  that worked through scenarios to determine 
possible outcomes. It was made clear in all the pr ess materials of the ri sks and the overall risk of 
the mission.  The facts, as they knew them, we re communicated over and over to the customer. 
 Contractor Involvement 
 
For Mars Pathfinder, some of the science exper iments were contracted to universities chosen 
through a NASA Announcement of Opportunity (AO) .  This meant a formal solicitation and a 
review of proposals. Particularly this is how the camera team was chosen (Peter Smith, et.al. of 
the University of Arizona). Other  experiments were dictated by the Science Working Group (e.g. 
Tommy Kanamu, et.al. University of Chic ago, the alpha proton X-ray spectrometer). 
 
In the case of both of the cont racts with the universities, they  were cost-reimbursable contracts 
that were monitored in a more collegial method.  For example, if the Un iversity of Arizona was 
supposed to do a particular job and certain capab ilities resided at JPL that could be performed 
Mars Pathfinder 35better, the work was moved and that task was tak en out of their contract (money included). This 
went both ways. Contracts became guide lines and not hard and fast rules.  
 
Mars Pathfinder 36Tools  
 
For Mars Pathfinder there were no unique tools used to manage the project.  The one tool that 
was used by Mars Pathfinder, is used by m any NASA space science projects, and unique to 
NASA is Earned Value Management (EVM). EVM is a standard NASA way of running planetary 
flight projects and performance metrics.  EVM is based on a set of project tasks, and each task 
has a cost to complete and/or items to procure.  Each task and procurement has a schedule for completion, and as each one is completed a monetar y credit is assigned.  These credits are then 
graphed against how much money has been spent t hus far on the project to determine where 
project progress follows on the curve.  
 
Knowledge Management 
 
Mars Pathfinder felt that documenting the developm ent of Mars Pathfinder was critical to be able 
to empower the team.  Although documentation wa s an obligation of the contract, Donna Shirley 
felt that documentation is only a representation of reality, as much as you can make it, and 
performance specs are largely just predictive.  Therefore, the ability to capture knowledge and 
manage it was only as good as you made it.  O ne tool used to assure that knowledge was 
documented and transferred was through a project lib rary.  A hard-copy library was maintained 
with all critical documents (e.g. engineering drawi ngs, test reports). These documents were kept 
lean.  For example, the Level 3 Requirements Document for the flight systems was only about a 
half-inch thick, compared to the Level 3 Require ments Document for Galileo or Cassini that are 
volumes thick.  A librarian maintained this library .  Another big portion of the knowledge for Mars 
Pathfinder was managed by the knowledge of individual s.  It was the responsibility of the team to 
be the keepers and sharers of knowledge.   
Learning Process 
 
Mars Pathfinder management felt that lessons l earned and the capturing of lessons learned were 
a valuable tool for project success.  Mars Path finder believed in lessons learned from start to 
finish.  For example, with Mars Pathfinder and Ma rs Global Surveyor (MGS), after the failure of 
Mars Observer (the precursor to MGS), Mars Pathfinder decided that they were not going to 
overload the science. Thus, Mars Pathfinder maintained a modest science mission to assure 
mission success.  For Mars Pathfinder, they also used seasoned engineers and scientist to learn 
from past projects.  The value in getting lessons  learned from people is as Donna Shirley stated, 
“…nobody has time to read them, specially on a BFC project. The only way to use lessons 
learned is to have the people that learned them or to go through the documentation. The way it is 
documented now, it is almost impossible.”  
During the project, Mars Pathfinder captured less ons learned as they went through the project.  
For example, after the launch, the project t eam had a lessons learned activity that produced a 
two-inch thick summary of the lessons learned at  subsystem and system level. At the end of the 
mission, a second lesson learned document was created. This document has since been passed 
on to other projects. Also, during the cruise  period, team management prepared a comprehensive 
summary of the lessons learned.  They em phasized the importance of  innovative management 
techniques, concurrent engineering/teaming practi ces, and spacecraft architecture. To relay 
these lessons learned, senior project staff hosted information transfer seminars on Mars 
Pathfinder lessons learned for all of JPL. 
 
The difficulty with lessons learned as Wayne Lee stat ed is that it is a “pull system.” You have to 
pull them from the people and the documents.  D onna Shirley stated that another problem with 
lessons learned at NASA is that learning is about  one project long. Wayne Lee expressed that a 
video lessons learned tool would be much more va luable. Wayne Lee explained it as, “…just like 
Mars Pathfinder 37we’re talking here, if you could get a video of a conversation with some key person in a project 
who was like a propulsion subsystem lead telling you about his trials and tribulations, that would 
sink in. A half-hour of the “Best of Crises” fr om propulsion, what worked and what didn’t would 
sink in. Because hopefully you’d capture the guy’s emotions and the pain and the excitement.”  
Mars Pathfinder 38Adapting Project Management to Project Type 
 
Mars Pathfinder was very much a strategic pr oject.  Although NASA had been to Mars before with 
the Mariner and Viking Programs, Mars Pathfinder was going to do it in new ways and prove that 
it could be done better, faster, and cheaper.  The philosophy of ‘better, faster, cheaper’ was 
virtually unproven in NASA and would open up new ways of doing business for an agency that 
prided itself on being on the forefront of space ex ploration.  Mars Pathfinder would only be the 
beginning of what NASA would hope to be a long-te rm exploration of Mars and a new way of 
doing business.  The task outcome for Mars Pathfinder was a tangible product of a spacecraft, 
lander, and rover with an intellectual activity.  Mars  Pathfinder required a significant creative effort 
for a product that had never been produced before.   Since it had never been done before, it 
required new ideas and the imagination of experi enced, talented people. As an external project 
Mars Pathfinder would be supplying data and excitem ent to two of its cust omers, the scientific 
community and the public.  Based on the public perception of Mars Pathfinder, it would be 
defined as an external project, but a deeper analysis of the project would define it as an internal 
project.  While Mars Pathfinder’s defined projec t objectives were scientific, it had a larger 
objective, and that was to show that NASA coul d safely land on Mars under the philosophy of 
‘better, faster, cheaper.’  When defining proj ect success and making strategic decisions, Mars 
Pathfinder was most concerned with their internal customer… NASA. 
 
The NCTP Model below represents the analysis of Ma rs Pathfinder in respects to its Novelty, 
Complexity, Technology, and Pace.  Connecting the NCTP classification with a straight line to 
form a diamond, gives a representation of the leve l of risk associated with a project.  The greater 
the area of the diamond, the great er the degree of risk.  While there is not a linear relationship 
between the area of the diamond for correct and in correct project risk, it can represent a 
difference in the degree of risk.

Novelty :  Mars Pathfinder was a breakthrough product that introduced to the world a new way of 
landing on Mars, and more significantly a robotic ro ver to traverse the planet.  No exploration 
robot has ever traversed across a planet in the hi story of space exploration.  Mars Pathfinder 
opened new possibilities to space exploration with a foundation built on a limited historical record 
of past projects similar to Mars Pathfinder.  Be cause of time constrai nts, development was quick 
and prototyping almost seemed parallel with asse mbly.  Mars Pathfinder maintained a flexible 
approach to development while using intuition,  excessive testing, and a learn-as-you-go 
mentality. While keeping a stri ct eye on the project objective s, schedule and cost, they were 
flexible with changes to stay focused on success.   With such a fast development pace, Mars 
Pathfinder made sure they kept their custom er educated about the potential risks and ultimate 
success. 
 
Complexity :  Mars Pathfinder was a system project.  As a complex collection of interactive 
elements and subsystems, it functioned as one unit to meet its operational needs.  While JPL led 
the effort for Mars Pathfinder, it relied heavily on s ubcontracts with other inst itutions to deliver the 
scientific instruments.  Mars Pathfinder had mu ltiple key customers from industry, public, 
government, and the scientific comm unity that were all vested in Mars Pathfinder’s development 
and success.  As a systems project Mars Path finder was a complex project that required 
extensive planning, computerized tools and software, hundreds or t housands of activities, tight 
and formal control, financial and schedule iss ues, reviews with customers and management, and 
extensive documentation.  It was JPL’s ultimate responsibility to guarantee integration and 
performance within the project cost, time, and quality constraints.  While documentation was 
minimized with Mars Pathfinder, the level of documentation required for any government project 
was par with any systems project.  With Mars Pa thfinder’s high profile, the level of oversight was 
not limited to JPL, but stretched through the ran ks of NASA.  The level of bureaucracy was far 
above that of any assembly project.  
Technology :  Mars Pathfinder was a high-tech project.  While most of the technology was 
commercial-off-the-shelf, there was a significant  portion of the technology that was new to 
planetary exploration.  More significantly t he way the technology was integrated had never been 
done before in space exploration history.  As a pr oduct, Mars Pathfinder was the first of its kind; 
integrating the technology in a way that had never been done before.  Mars Pathfinder required 
long periods of design, development, testing, and r edesign with multiple design cycles that had to 
start before the project started.  With the extensive testing t hat was required for a high-tech 
project like Mars Pathfinder, in depth, technical re views were mandatory to make a project of this 
complexity successful.  In conjunction with these reviews, communication had to be frequent and 
active.  The complexity and communication demands required management to be of good technical skills and intimately involved in the project.  They also had to recognize the unique 
challenges of Mars Pathfinder and be flexible  to extensive testing and design changes.  
Therefore, design freezes had to be sc heduled and as late as possible.   
 
Pace :  Mars Pathfinder was a blitz-critical proj ect.  With most deep space projects, schedule, 
cost, and technology have limited margins.  Bec ause of celestial mechanics the launch window 
for a Mars’ mission only come around every 24-26 m onths.  For a project like Mars Pathfinder, 
once it starts down the path toward a specif ied launch date, adjustments in the schedule are 
measured in days and not months or years, and any significant delays in the schedule mean 
cancellation.  In addition, Mars Pathfinder was under a three-year development time from project 
start to launch.  This was unprecedented for a pr oject of this size and complexity.  To be 
successful, Mars Pathfinder had to find new ways of doing business and work around some of the standard policies and procedures.  Mostly hand picked team members, worked very closely with 
each other with a high-spirited, dedicated attitude.   Problems were resolved quickly with direct 
Mars Pathfinder 40lines of communication to management and project m anagers that were intimately involved in the 
project in both monitoring and working. 
 
Success Factors 
It is difficult to find deeply rooted faults in Mars Pathfinder.  Management clearly understood what 
their objectives were and what it would take to  accomplish those objectives.  They understood the 
scope, technical uncertainty, and pace of the project, and what managerial practices were 
needed to make Mars Pathfinder a success.  Keys to Mars Pathfinder’s success were: 
 Strategy 
o Modest and Attainable Objectives 
o Clearly defined success dimensions 
o Understanding of Competit ive Advantage and Value 
 Spirit 
o Deeply rooted, common commitment, purpose, and goals 
o Reduction in policy 
o Team empowerment 
 Project Organization 
o Accountability  
o Flat organization 
o Maintaining core workforce 
o People worked project from beginning to end 
o Co-location 
o Organizational problems were managed quickly  
o Limited top management involvement 
 Processes 
o Peer reviews 
o Formal reviews viewed as rolling gates 
o Adequate resources 
o Testing to reduce uncertainty 
o Customer/Vendor Involvement 
 Tools 
o Project library and librarian 
 
Mars Pathfinder understood the importance of project success and management knew of the 
importance of Mars Pathfinder to be successful.  To secure project success, objectives were 
defined that were modest and attainable.  Object ives were set for Mars Pathfinder that only 
unless there was a catastrophic failure, would they not be achieved.  Tertiary objectives were set 
but success was not measured on obtaining these obj ectives.  These objectives, while modest 
and attainable, were clearly defined and success wa s easily measured against these dimensions.  
While the competitive advantage of Mars Pathfinder  was not clearly defined to the project team, 
management understood exactly what was the co mpetitive advantage of Mars Pathfinder.  
Management worked very hard to define the value of Mars Pathfinder and transfer this to the 
project team through the spirit.  Fostering in the team a spirited belief in why Mars Pathfinder was 
unique and could benefit NASA and the scientific  community.  Team members developed a 
deeply rooted, common commitment to the proj ect and its success.  There was an understanding 
that they were doing something different, and a su ccessful project would have significant value to 
their customers.  
To develop this can-do spirit in Mars Pathfi nder, management had to reduce some of the policies 
that would restrict people from thinking outside t he box, or looking for alternative processes to 
meet mission objectives.  A reduction in policy, lifted many bureaucratic st ructures that would 
have diluted the high-octane spirit of Mars Pa thfinder.  By reducing the policy and thus the 
Mars Pathfinder 41structure, management moved the responsibilit y to the people and empowered the people to be 
the decision-makers and shepards of their processe s.  This created a high level of accountability, 
and made the people an intimate part of the project.  People felt that they were the project and 
not the processes.  Mars Pathfinder maintained a flat organization, and thus accountability could 
not be passed or spread throughout the organiza tion, and problems could quickly be identified 
and resolved.  Maintaining a flat organization m eant a limited workforce; therefore, people worked 
the project from beginning to end.  People follo wed a system through t he development process, 
and were held accountable for that processes/system.  Because of their ability to be co-located or 
located in close proximity for real-time, face-t o-face, focused meetings, issues could be resolved 
in real-time.  Mars Pathfinder was given many liberties to be successful, and to allow the project 
those liberties there was a limited involvement  from top management.  While Mars Pathfinder 
kept top management informed, they did not in terfere with Mars Pathfinder management to do 
what they had to do to guarantee project success. 
 
Reviews are a part of all projects but Mars Path finder saw reviews as a critical part of project 
success.  Management saw reviews as so important  that significant resources were allocated 
toward reviews and serious thought was given to who would sit on the review committees.  Mars 
Pathfinder had two types of reviews: informal ( peer) and formal (phase) reviews.  The informal 
reviews were seen as very critical to gaining insight from very capable and experienced technical 
people.  These reviews were not held as standar d points in time, but at more random points 
throughout the project lifecycle.  While the form al reviews were held at there standard phases 
throughout the project, management saw these review s as rolling gates.  Therefore, the project 
did not stop or slow down as one of these revi ews was approaching.  The project would continue 
to proceed into the next phase well before the review  would occur.  By relying on the technical 
expertise of the informal reviews Mars Pathfinder could proceed forward with a significant level of 
confidence. 
 To reduce uncertainty, significant testing was performed throughout the project.  Management 
understood when to freeze certain phases, move to the next phase, and test.  Testing was 
performed not as a quantity activity but as a quality ac tivity.  The objective of testing was not  to 
test a system over and over, but in every possible scenario. 
 
Mars Pathfinder understood who was their customer  and believed the best customer is listened to 
and well informed.   While attempting to make sure  that all of the customer’s requests were met, 
they clearly defined to the cust omer the limitation and risks of Mars Pathfinder. Likewise, the 
contractors were viewed as a critical part of the pr oject’s process; therefor e, they were in many 
cases made part of the project decisions. 
 Unique to Mars Pathfinder was to establish a project library to file all project documentation.  This 
library allowed for a centralized location for documented knowledge.  Management saw this as 
such an important tool that they designat ed a project librarian to manage the library. 
 
Recommendations 
Despite the success of Mars Pathfinder, no projec t will ever be considered a flawless success.  
Mars Pathfinder was has its faults in areas su ch as strategic focus,  training, and documenting 
processes. 
 Recommendation 1 – Policy to support the strategy:  At the time of Mars Pathfinder, BFC was 
just a developing concept.  NASA told the Mars Pathfinder management to just make it happen.  
To make BFC cheaper happen, Mars Pathfinder was given the authority to reduce or eliminate 
certain policies.  While this helped them be succe ssful, in the end, there was not a clear linkage 
between the policy and the project strategy.  Management understood the strategic focus with a 
Mars Pathfinder 42relentless pursuit of the co mpetitive advantage and value of the project.  Although Mars 
Pathfinder was successful in instilling the strategic focus into the project team through the spirit 
and vision, without a policy to support this focus, it  allowed no mechanism to formally transfer this 
throughout the project or to other projects.  While other projects attempted to repeat what Mars 
Pathfinder had accomplished, it was the people and not  the policy that made the project.  Without 
a documented policy to support the strategy, the success of Mars Pathfinder was tied into the 
people.  
Mars Pathfinder was under extreme pressure to be successful, because of this pressure there 
was less emphasis put on capturing how Mars Pathfinder was managed in the processes.  Therefore, it became difficult to capture and tr ansfer the success of Mars Pathfinder to other 
projects.  Mars Pathfinder was successful because of  the people, not the proc esses or the tools.  
Mars Pathfinder was successful without follo wing many standard procedures and doing things 
differently.  But, it was not a breaking-the-rules m entality that attributed to  its success; it was the 
management’s vision and the team believing in t hat vision.  Mars Pathfinder could have been 
successful under other management models, but it was the right  mix of people that made the 
project successful. 
 Recommendation 2 – Provide appropriate training:   Mars Pathfinder relied on knowledgeable 
team members and on-the-job training.  This worked for Mars Pathfinder because they had the 
right skill mix of experience, but this is not a pr actice that can be relied upon for other projects.  
Being able to select the right skill mix assumes that there is an unlimited supply of experienced 
capable people to choose for a project.  Some m anagers for Mars Pathfinder believe that the 
most talented people were not always available.  Although this may be a true statement for every 
person working on the project, Mars Pathfinder di d have people that were willing to leave their 
current project to come to work for Mars Pathfinder .  If a project is not as high profile as a Mars 
Pathfinder, people are not always lining up at the door to join a project. In addition, this unique 
skill mix cannot be attributed to a formal or inform al project training system.  The team members 
of Mars Pathfinder received no formal or even in formal training to prepare them for the project 
(managerial or technical).    
Recommendation 3 – Fully document the processes, even the process for success:  Mars 
Pathfinder worked to maintain what they called a flat organization.  Maintaining line organizations 
that were only two people deep, and functional groups that were 7-10 people.  While this allowed 
for more direct lines of communication and problem s to be solved quickly, it left Mars Pathfinder 
very vulnerable to a reliance on individuals and not teams or documentation for sources of 
information or success.  This structure adds a level of risk when information and knowledge are 
tied to the people.  Sustaining a level of know ledge sharing, Mars Pathfinder was a co-located 
project.  While this was the perception of many , it was not the perception of some of the 
management.  The difference in the perception of co-location can better be described as a 
difference in definition.  If Mars Pathfinder is  defined by co-location as everyone being in one 
building, then Mars Pathfinder was not co-located.  The rover team was in a different building.  If 
co-location is defined by the team’s ability to eas ily access other team members in a face-to-face 
environment, then Mars Pathfinder was co-located.

Lunar Prospector 1Executive Summary 
Lunar Prospector was the first competitively se lected mission in the NASA Discovery Program, 
developed to produce frequent, low-cost missions to explore the solar system.  Lunar Prospector 
was a spin-stabilized spacecraft designed to map the surface composition and magnetic field of 
the Moon and begin investigating some of the 80% of the moon’s surface f eatures, structure, and 
composition not investigated during Apollo. 
 As a product, Lunar Prospector was a single vehicl e (orbiter), and several instruments designed 
to demonstrate a low cost system for orbiti ng the Moon and expanding its scientific knowledge.  
Additional objectives included the deployment and oper ation of various scient ific instruments: 
neutron spectrometer, gamma ray spectrometer, magnetometer/ele ctron reflectometer, doppler 
gravity experiment, and alpha particle spectrometer.  While much of the technology was known, 
its application and what Lunar Prospector was planned to accomplish made it different than 
anything that had been done before.  
 As a project Lunar Prospector was to design, test, and develop an orbiter that would obtain 
scientific data and demonstrate the philosophy of ‘faster, better,  cheaper.’  With a development 
time of almost three years and a project co st which included development ($34 million), launch 
vehicle ($25 million), and operations ($4 million), for a total of $63 million, Lunar Prospector was 
chartered with being the first competitive se lected Discovery Program mission to demonstrate 
‘faster, better, cheaper.’  Lunar Prospector in volved 75 to 100 people from NASA Ames Research 
Center, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, N ASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, University of 
California – Berkley, University of Arizona, Lockheed-Martin, Lunar Research Institute (Alan 
Binder, Principle Investigator, left Lockheed Martin to establish the Lunar Research Institute), and 
Los Alamos National Laboratory.  As a projec t Lunar Prospector could be described as a high-
tech project.  Much of the technology was proven from previous spacecraft, but had not been 
incorporated in this configuration.  The complexi ty of the project could be described as a system.  
As is the case with all deep space missions, t hey are a collection of interactive elements and 
subsystems that must perform a wide range of functions under extreme conditions.  The pace of 
the project was a blitz-critical project.  While many of the characteri stics point to a fast-
competitive project, it is the inflexible l aunch date that moves deep space missions like Lunar 
Prospector into a blitz-critical mode.  Time and budgets become fixed and any error in either of 
these areas meant cancellation for the project. 
 
Lunar Prospector ended on July 31, 1999, when the s pacecraft was jettisoned into a crater near 
the south pole of the Moon as part of an experiment to confirm the existence of water ice.  The 
mission ran for 19 months and successfully complet ed all of its objectives. The data collected has 
allowed for the construction of a detailed map of  the surface compositi on of the Moon and results 
have been ten times better than ever planned.  The information gathered was far more 
comprehensive than any data ever collected. 
 Lunar Prospector was successful because they under stood well before the project started that 
simplicity would be the key to project success.  Lunar Prospector was well defined with a clear 
understanding of the scope, technical uncertain ty, and pace.  This guided management toward 
design constraints that kept Lunar Pr ospector on budge and on time. Lunar Prospector 
determined their strategy early wi th customer-defined objectives that were simple, attainable, and 
valuable.  A focused, unspoken, and common co mmitment from a co-located team laid a 
foundation for limited top-management involvement and a dedication of people from project start 
to finish.  Lunar Prospector understood the value of informal and formal reviews, how they related 
to when to freeze designs, how they impacted requirements, and that only a good test program 
can reduce uncertainty.

Lunar Prospector 7Background 
Return to the moon…  this is exactly what Lunar  Prospector (LP) attempted to accomplish, but 
under a budgetary and time constraint not compar able to any mission in the history of the 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration (N ASA) or aerospace.  What Lunar Prospector 
was designed to accomplish under a minimal budget, was many magnitudes surpassed to any 
mission of any kind.  Despite an extensive amount of data collect ed from the Apollo program, a 
large part of the Moon remained and remains uni nvestigated.  It was not until Apollo 15 (the 
program ended with Apollo 17) that true science was conducted on the surface of the moon.  A 
majority of this science was conducted around t he equator and only resulted in a 20% edification 
of the moon’s surface features , structure, and composition.  In 1992, the Lunar Exploration 
Science Working Group (LExSWG) confirmed this limitation in lunar data in a culmination of 
working group reports entitled “A Planetary Scienc e Strategy for the Moon. ”  The LExSWG stated 
that the following sets of measurements must  be collected to better understand the Moon and its 
role in our celestial universe.  The scientif ic objective dictated by the LExSWG were: 
 
1. Determine globally the elemental and mi neralogical composition of the surface. 
2. Determine globally the surface topography and gravitational field. 
3. Map globally the distribut ion of surface magnetic anoma lies and measure the magnitude 
of the induced dipole moment. 
4. Obtain a global image database along with selected coverage in stereo and color. 
5. Measure the microwave brightness tem perature as a function of wavelength. 
6. Measure globally the compos ition, structure, and temporal variability of the lunar 
atmosphere. 
 In 1994 Clementine, designed to space qualif y lightweight imaging sensors and component 
technologies for the next generation of Departm ent of Defense (DoD) spacecraft, addressed 
objective 4; therefore, it left five of the six objectives open for Lunar Prospector.  Of the remaining 
five, Lunar Prospector chose to embark upon four  (1-3 and 6).  Although Clementine addressed 
objective 4, it was not part of Clementine’s st rategic intent.  Clementine, a $75 million Pentagon 
spacecraft, was designed to track missiles and test “Star Wars” sensors.  Despite this, Deputy 
Project Manager, Stewart Nozette, convinced the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization that the 
Star Wars sensors could provide valuable scient ific information about the Moon.  He proposed 
that Clementine use its Bislatic  Radar Experiment to beam radio waves into the dark regions of 
the South Pole of the Moon, into lighted regions  of the South Pole, and other places on the Moon 
for comparison.  Then in April 1994 on Orbit 234, the spacecraft revealed what many scientists 
theorized and hoped, ice on the Moon’s surface.  Despite what Paul Spudis, Lunar and Planetary 
Institute, declared “an amazing discovery,” ther e was still much speculation in the scientific 
community over the interpretation of the dat a.  This extensive debate raised many more 
questions and opened the door for a mission such as Lunar Prospector. 
 
As Alan Binder put it, “We went to the moon in ‘69 and early ‘70s and in thirty years we haven’t 
been there.  And this is a crime against humani ty.”  When Alan Binder returned to the United 
States in 1983 from a ten year sabbatical in Germany, he recognized this gap in exploration and 
human curiosity, so he began conceptual devel opments for what would later become Lunar 
Prospector.  He believed that NASA did not have the resources or drive to develop a return trip to 
the Moon; therefore, he pursued interest outside of the governm ent.  In late 1988, the Space 
Studies Institute (SSI) in Princeton and the Na tional Space Society in Houston – which Binder 
was a part – simultaneously decided to do a missi on, which became Lunar Prospector.  Binder 
and Preston set up the Lunar Exploration Institut e (LEI), which was a non-profit, tax-exempt 
Texas Corporation made up of volunteers.   This team consisted of about thirty NASA and 
contractor engineers working at Johnson Space Center, and some of Binder’s science colleagues 
Lunar Prospector 8that would define the payload, wh ich would later fly on Lunar Prospec tor.  This development team 
set four simple goals for themselves bef ore they ventured into this project: 
 
(1) Prove that a mission can be done without huge NASA bureaucracy. (2) Prove it can be done with a small group of  competent people who know what they are 
doing. 
(3) Prove it can be done inexpensively. (4) Reawaken interest in the Moon. 
 
Through volunteers, Binder and Preston were abl e to complete a Phase A study.  The SSI 
provided $75,000 for a Phase B Design Study.  Normal  Phase B studies cost two or three million 
dollars, but Binder was able to get a small company made up of Hughes engineers to win the 
Request for Proposal (RFP) to perform the Phase B study.  With the Phase B dollars secure, this 
placed this small company in charge of designi ng the spacecraft, SSI in charge of the money, and 
LEI in charge of the science and engineering, bu ilding, and flying the spacecraft.  SSI was 
supposed to continue to find financial support for the project but failed.  This left Binder searching 
for money from many of the major aerospace co mpanies (e.g. Boeing, Lockheed, Allied Signal), 
and Lunar Prospector stuck on the drawing board.  
At the time, Binder’s biggest obstacle was t hat most aerospace companies were securing 
contracts for hundreds of millions of dollars and to support Binder’s Lunar Prospector would show 
that missions could be done for a lot less.  Bi nder and Preston continued to search for funding 
sources, even approaching Coke and Pepsi.  When Mike Griffin became Associate Administrator 
of the Space Exploration Initiative, now NASA Space Science Enterprise, he believed in Lunar 
Prospector and promised to secure funds to s upport the project.  But Griffin succumbed to 
political pressures from Congress and backed away from Lunar Prospector. 
 About this same time, NASA was beginning developm ent of the Discovery Program, built on the 
Goldin philosophy of faster, better, cheaper.  In the early 90's, the Office of Space Science (Code 
S), responsible for all of NASA's programs rela ting to astronomy, the solar system, and the sun 
and its interaction with Earth, began looking at how to solve the issue of an over reliance on large 
missions for scientific data.  When Dr. Wesley Huntress became Associate Administrator of Code 
S in March 1993, he was a strong advocate of fi nding a way for NASA to provide more frequent 
opportunities for space science.  At the same time, Congress became aware of this issue and 
asked NASA to develop a program for smaller missions that would allow more frequent opportunities. 
 
In April 1992, Code S submitted a report to Congre ss with the basic framework for the Discovery 
Program.  These basic constraint s would be missions that were: 
 
1.  $150 million for development. 2.  3 years for development time. 
3.  Launch on nothing larger than a Delta II 
 In 1993, Congress approved the plan proposed by C ode S. To show Congress that it could be 
done, Code S selected two charter missions - one to JPL (Mars Pathfinder) and one to the Johns 
Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory ( APL) (Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous).  Later 
missions would be selected under a competitive peer review process.    
 
When the Discovery Program was announced Binder dec ided that the only thing left was to team 
with Lockheed Martin as the industry partner and try and win Discovery Program funding. LP was 
the first competitively selected mission from the Discovery Program.  The concept of using the 
competitive selection process for choosing missions for NASA has become routine in the 
Lunar Prospector 9planetary exploration projects.  Ten to fi fteen years ago this was not done. When LP was 
selected, the Discovery Program  was still basking in the success of Mars Pathfinder and the soon 
to be successful Near Earth Asteroid Rendezv ous (NEAR) missions.  The Discovery Program 
was showing that missions could be done Faster , Better, Cheaper (FBC), and LP would only 
become another shining example of FBC.  Lunar  Prospector pushed the limits of FBC and raised 
the bar for FBC projects to come.  During its initial reviews many felt that there was Lunar 
Prospector and then all the rest (30 proposal were submitted).  The quality of the Lunar 
Prospector proposal was perceived as above all the other proposals in every category.   Because 
of the work that Binder and others had complet ed before the proposal wa s submitted, they 
presented a complete mission from launch to mission end.    
Mission Description 
Lunar Prospector was a successful marriage bet ween what Hubbard called “Alan’s science 
interest, my interest in small missions, and Lo ckheed Martin as the implementing organization.”  
From its selection to authority to proceed, it  was about six months and then from authority to 
proceed to launch an unprecedented 22 months.   Lunar Prospector involved 75 to 100 people 
from NASA Ames Research C enter, NASA Goddard Space Flight  Center, NASA Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory, University of California – Berkley,  University of Arizona, Lockheed-Martin, Lunar 
Research Institute (Alan Binder left Lockheed Martin  to establish the Lunar Research Institute), 
and Los Alamos National Laboratory.  Its mission objectives were: 
 
1. Obtain high quality scientific data about the Moon’s structure, composition, and 
resources. 
2. Demonstrate that the philosophy of “faste r, better, cheaper (FBC)” can successfully yield 
a rapid development, very inex pensive planetary science mission. 
3. Create an innovative education and outreach program, which stimulates public interest in 
planetary exploration. 
 
Project cost included development ($34 million), launch vehicle ($25 million), and operations ($4 
million), for a total of $63 million.  Many Lunar Prospector team members like to boast that the 
project cost one-third the budget of the movie Titanic.  Lunar Prospector was a Principal 
Investigator (PI) led project with NASA oversi ght. The program/project management role was the 
responsibility of the Mission Office at NASA Ames  Research Center (ARC).  G. Scott Hubbard, 
NASA Mission Manager, Ames Research Center (ARC) and Sylvia Cox, NASA Deputy Mission 
Manager, from the ARC Mission Office would act as  the single point to the PI/Industry Team.  
Alan Binder, Principle Investigator, Lunar Res earch Institute (at Lockheed Martin during 
development) and Thomas Dougherty, Projec t Manager, Lockheed Martin, who managed the 
science and daily operations, would lead the PI/Indus try Team.  Lockheed Martin was responsible 
the spacecraft development, launch and operation.   See Table 1 for project timeline.

LP launched from Launch Complex 46 of Cape C anaveral, Florida at 09:28 EST on January 6, 
1998 aboard a Lockheed-Martin Athena II expendable l aunch vehicle.  This was the maiden 
voyage, not only for LP, but the Athena II.  At 09:32 EST, the payload separated and at 10:25 
EST the spacecraft was put on its trajectory fo r the Moon (a 105-hour coast) by the Star-37 
Trans-Lunar Injection stage.  LP was scheduled fo r a one-year, polar orbit, with primary mission 
objectives of: 
 
1. Determine globally the elemental and mi neralogical composition of the surface. 
2. Determine globally the surface topography and gravitational field. 
3. Map globally the distribut ion of surface magnetic anoma lies and measure the magnitude 
of the induced dipole moment. 
4. Measure globally the compos ition, structure, and temporal variability of the lunar 
atmosphere. 
 
The mission was declared official when the spac ecraft switched on, 56 minutes, 30 seconds after 
liftoff. Shortly after this the s pacecraft’s five instruments – the gamma-ray spectrometer, alpha 
particle spectrometer, neutron s pectrometer, magnetometer and electron reflectometer – were 
turned on. On January 11, at 07:20 EST, LP succe ssfully entered (captured) into lunar orbit, and 
began its mission to globally map the Moon just  a few days later.  Figure 1 shows Lunar 
Prospector’s trajectory from launc h to lunar orbit insertion.  With the primary mission beginning on 
January 15, 1998, Lunar Prospector spent one year mapping the entire surface of the Moon from 
a distance of about 100 kilometers.  This phas e produced data at a quality far greater than 
anything that had been produce before.  The mission was extended for an additional seven 
months, starting in January 1999. Lunar Prospector is then lowered to an orbit 30 kilometers 
above the lunar surface to obtain higher resoluti on data.  Originally, the mission was designed to 
end when the spacecraft ran out of fuel and cras hed into the lunar surface.  This changed when 
Lunar Prospector 11someone suggested crashing the spacecraft into t he lunar surface as an experiment to confirm 
the existence of water on the M oon. The spacecraft was successfully directed into a crater near 
the lunar South Pole, thought a possible locati on for ice, but no water was detected in the 
resulting impact plume.  Lunar Prospector impac ted the moon at 5:52 am EST, July 31, 1999. 
The final targeting burn was commanded an hour earlier to target the impact to hit the 
permanently shadowed crater near the south pol e, at -87.7 deg latitude, 42 deg longitude.

Technology Description 
Lunar Prospector was a new generation of planetar y spacecraft.  Although all of the technology 
was off-the-shelf or borrowed from other prov en spacecraft, it was an innovation in systems 
engineering and management that made it possible.  A medium-tec h project structured around a 
blitz-critical project pace helped bring this sy stem into reality under strict budgetary and time 
constraints.  Lunar Prospector was a spin-stabiliz ed spacecraft, 1.4 meters in diameter by 1.22 
meters in height and weighing 2964.4 Kg, and built  by Lockheed Martin Missiles and Space.  
Around the spacecraft were three radial instrument  booms or arms (2.4 meters in length) for 
deploying the five scientific inst ruments.  These five instrum ents performed six experiments to 
address the scientific objectives. 
1. Neutron Spectrometer (NS) --Map hydr ogen at several signature energies and thereby 
infer the presence or absence of water. 
2. Gamma Ray Spectrometer (GRS) -- Map 10 key elemental abundances, several of which 
offer clues to lunar formation and evolution. 
Lunar Prospector 123. Magnetometer/Electron Reflectometer (M ag/ER) -- These two experiments combine to 
measure lunar magnetic field strength at the surface and at the altitude of the spacecraft 
and thereby greatly enhance understanding of lunar magnetic anomalies. 
4. Doppler Gravity Experiment (DGE) -- Make  an operational gravity map of the Moon for 
use by future missions as well as LP by  mapping gravity field measurements from 
changes in the spacecraft’s orbital speed and position.  
5. Alpha Particle Spectrometer (APS) -- Map out-gassing events by detecting Radon gas 
(current outgassing events) and Polonium (tracer of recent, i.e. 50 years).  
 
The five instruments, a cost-effective $3.6 m illion, were built on previously developed and tested 
hardware.  Additionally, the spacecraft was desi gned and built on existing hardware.  While most 
of the technology was off-the-shelf or from ot her missions, its application was considered a new 
generation in planetary exploration spacec raft.  Making Lunar Prospector a breakthrough 
innovation.  The engineering and science team work ed very hard to match the design constraints 
to this existing technology.  
Power was provided by solar arrays mounted on the outside of the cylindrical drum shaped 
spacecraft.  The spacecraft maintained a polar orbit every 118 minutes and covered the lunar 
surface twice a month at a nominal altitude of  100 kilometers.  The Moon rotated a full turn 
beneath the spacecraft every lunar cycle (~27. 3 days). Lunar Prospector was designed for a one-
year-long primary mission with an optional extended mission of six months at a lower altitude. 
 
Lunar Prospector would return more relevant data per dollar invested then any mission in NASA 
history.  This was accomplished with a scientific team that consisted of  industry, government and 
academia.  Lunar Prospectors scientific team was lead by:

Strategy  
 
Objectives 
 
“It’s a matter of saying this is what we are going do and we don’t change anything we build.”     
- Alan Binder, personal interview 
 
Lunar Prospector objectives were designed to be si mple, attainable, and provide a significant 
value to the science community.  It was the sci ence community that Lunar Prospector gave the 
most consideration to when establishing their obj ectives.  Satisfying the scientific community 
became driving factor for the project objectives and   
 
While not all NASA projects are defined by t he same mechanism, most planetary projects do 
follow a usual scoping.  For Lunar Prospector and other Discovery Missions  it was slightly 
different.  Typically, a science advisory group defi nes the project scope for a planetary mission.  
For Lunar Prospector, this was the LExSWG.  The group lobbies a program office and the 
program office goes to NASA headquarte rs to request a mission that they would like to fly.  They 
specify to NASA Headquarter the amount of money  that this would require and the science 
constituents it would satisfy. NASA Headquarters then determines if they will fund the project, and 
then at project inception the sci entific goals are set (observations, measurements, time needed to 
collect data, quality of data).  These scientific requirements then drive the spacecraft design.  
What was different about Lunar Prospector is that  there was a competitive selection process 
based on a solicitation.  The Discovery Program does not specify mission objectives, but general 
mission constraints.  Lunar Prospector’s scientif ic objectives were defined my Alan Binder based 
on the LExSWG, but Lunar Prospector did not have to lobby to a program office for funding.  As 
with many planetary projects, what typically happens over the course of t he project is that the 
realities of building a spacecraft and having it operate under the specified conditions are much 
harder than envisioned in the beginning.  Science mi ssions will start with a certain payload and by 
the time they fly, they fly twice the original  payload.  As Alan Binder stated, “Most engineers do 
not like to build the same old stuff they always  want to add some new toy.”   What was unique 
about Lunar Prospector was that the mission that was defined in 1988 was the mission that flew 
in 1998.   
 
Competitive Advantage/Value 
 
It is difficult for a government project to def ine a competitive advantage.   Usually they are 
supported by a congressional or administrative pus h.  In some cases they are developed from a 
scientific community pull.  In either case there is usually little competition, but Lunar Prospector 
was subjected to stringent competition to be select ed.  The competition was in the initial proposal 
phase.  There were 30 proposals that responded to the Discovery Program solicitation the year 
Lunar Prospector was selected, which included all of the science community that had the 
capability to propose a space science mission.  Binder believed that Lunar Prospector’s 
competitive advantage was a simple spacecraft and streamlined management.  This translated to 
the best science per dollar of any other mission.  Saunders believed that Lunar Prospector’s ratio 
of science per dollar was not even comparabl e to the other mission proposed with Lunar 
Prospector.  Hubbard stated that science per  dollar was Lunar Prospectors competitive 
advantage.   Lunar Prospector was a simple design with a simple mission profile.  Nobody could 
compete with a spacecraft that cost $20 million and a fi ve-instrument suit at a cost of $3.5 million.  
Lunar Prospector was a total of $63 million, and most NASA space science instruments cost 
around $10 million each.  Management was kept to a minimum and managers kept a one-on-one 
Lunar Prospector 14relationship with engineers.  This approach minimized the bureaucracy.  Lunar Prospector 
worked to maintain themselves as a small company  in a big company.  Once the project started 
the competition was their schedule and budget.  Like  all Discovery missions, going over budget or 
schedule meant the project being canceled.  
Once Lunar Prospector was initiated, the com petitive advantage transitioned into the value.  
Lunar Prospector believed that its value had three customers: the Office of Space Science at 
NASA Headquarters and the Discovery Program, the sponsor; the scientific community, user of 
the data; and the general public.  Obtainment of the project objectives means project success and 
provides value to the NASA customer in the fo rm of return on investment.  Lunar Prospector 
showed that low-cost competitiv ely selected space exploration mi ssions could be done.  This was 
great value to NASA in seeking support of Congr ess and the general public.  Additional value to 
the general public came in the form of educ ation and outreach and excitement in science and 
technology.  Finally, the value to the scientific comm unity, definer of the project objective, came in 
the form of data for research.  
Business Perspective (Success Dimensions) 
 
Like all Discovery class missions, Lunar Prospec tor’s success was measured on their ability to 
stay within budget and on schedule while maintaini ng the science objectives. Traditionally within 
NASA the standard mechanism for running planetary f light projects and performance metrics is a 
system called “earned value.”  Earned value is  based on a cost per task performance standard.  
For example, if a project has one hundred diffe rent tasks (or items to procure), and each 
task/item has an estimated value or cost, thes e tasks or procurements will be completed by a 
certain point in time.  As each one is complet ed, a monetary credit for completion is given and 
that is graphed against how much money has been spent  thus far to see where a project is on the 
curve.  Alan Binder said that the earned value system is fine for reporting to upper management, 
but has less value in the day-to-day operation of a project.   
 
What is also the case with Discovery Missions that  is not found in most projects is that there is 
very little leeway.  Planetary missions are re stricted based on a window of opportunity due to 
celestial alignment (launch windows).  Lunar Pr ospector was no exception.  Although launch 
opportunities to the Moon are much more frequent t han a trip to Mars, NASA is very strict about 
their allowance for delays in Discovery missi ons.  NASA was even more restrictive on Lunar 
Prospector, not allowing the normal fifteen-percent  budget reserves.  As Binder stated, “We had a 
schedule and we simply marched to that schedule.  We knew how much money we intended to 
spend every phase, we kept to our schedule and those were our marks.”  Lunar Prospector had 
little choice but to stay on budget, within schedule,  and meet their objective s. As Cox stated, “The 
cost constraints under which Lockheed (Martin) signed up for Lunar Prospector clearly forced the 
whole project to pay a great deal of attenti on to not growing requirements, not changing the 
science, not trying to make this fancier than it needed to be.”  
In the case of Lunar Prospector there was a set of Level I science requirements which was what 
the mission was mandated to accomplish.  Alt hough, there was a set of secondary goals of 
demonstrating how faster, better, cheaper could be successful.  In the end, it was the science 
objectives that determined the projects success.   Therefore, the data management plan very 
carefully spelled out data requirements of a specified quality.  Lunar Prospector was a data 
purchase program.  That meant that Lunar Prospector had a certain standard set of data 
requirements they had to collect.  Even in their contract it did not specify the delivery of a 
spacecraft or launch vehicle; the requirements we re to deliver scientific data.  Therefore the 
success of the mission was totally quantified in te rms of delivering the specific science data to 
meet the requirements of each of the instruments.  What they produced was a factor of two or 
three better.  So scientifically Lunar Prospec tor produced the promised product and better.   
Lunar Prospector 15 
How these science objectives were defined was ke y to its success.  Binder presented the science 
objectives to NASA with a strong understanding of the possible results because similar 
instruments had flown and their capability was k nown; in addition, Binder had worked for many 
years to get commercial or NASA backing for Lunar  Prospector, so Lunar Prospector had already 
been honed down in its mission objectives.  This m eant that Binder was able to constrain the 
projected results to increase the probability of su ccess.  As Binder stated, “I don’t like to make 
promises that I can’t keep and scientists have a tendency to somewhat exaggerate what they are 
going in the hopes that they will convince som eone.  I intentionally kind of downplayed what I 
thought we could get.  And interestingly enough my co-PIs did the same thing to me.  They 
thought that they could do better but they weren’t going to tell me they could.  So we went in there 
with a very realistic definition of what we  could do and it turned out that our optimistic 
assessments were correct.” 
 
Lunar Prospector worked towards a self-m easurement of success that appeared to be 
straightforward, it was what Lunar Prospector benchmarked itself against that was harder to 
define.  As with many NASA proj ects post-Apollo, it is really hard for project teams to benchmark 
themselves against something.  Rarely is t here anyone to beat or is anyone doing anything even 
remotely similar.  As with Lunar Prospector, they ultimately benchmarked themselves against 
what they promised, deliver it  on schedule, within budget and with a level of quality data.  One 
benchmark that NASA attempts to define is ‘Did  we do better then last time?’ This is an 
interesting benchmark because sometimes there is  no last time (this was the case for Lunar 
Prospector), better has to be quantified, and in ever y case you always try to do better than last 
time. Rarely are missions with NASA repeated i dentically with the expectation of achieving 
identical results.  Cox agrees that there is not  formal or easily defined benchmark.  She states 
that the whole management team benchmarked t heir decision process on their experience or 
perception of why they had been successful in t he past.  With little for Lunar Prospector to 
benchmark against, NASA wrote the contract with Lockheed Martin as an award fee contract.  
There was a clause in the contract and in the awar d fee plan that said that for every dollar of 
overrun the first two million dollars came out of  Lockheed Martin’s fee.  This became a very 
strong performance incentive for Lockheed Martin bec ause the total amount of fee was at risk if 
the science was not successful.  If Lunar Prospec tor launched and did not return science or did 
not make it to the Moon, the entire award fee was at risk and it could be demanded back.   
 
Strategic Focus 
 
When Binder was asked what the strategy fo r Lunar Prospector was he answered simply, “You 
are responsible, you’re responsible to me, no pa ssing the buck, keep it simple, and do it on time.  
If there is a problem we sit down together and fix it right then and there.  That was the whole 
strategy.”  Binder lived by the motto: “Keep It Simp le Stupid” (KISS), and this is how he ran Lunar 
Prospector.  This meant no redundancy, modularity,  backup or test model; it meant going “single 
string.”  Binder’s philosophy on singl e string was that “if you know you’ve got a backup you’re not 
quite as careful in construction.  If you hav e no backup you are damned careful about what you 
are doing.”  Binder’s strategy could not have been reality without  a reduction in the insight and 
oversight.  Hubbard believed that this was critic al to a focused strategy and keeping the team 
focused.  Before Lunar Prospector started they  had a series of meetings with the Program 
Manager, Principal Investigator, Project M anager for Lockheed Martin, and Senior Management 
of Lockheed Martin to lay out what they were going to try to do and how they were going to try 
and do it.  These meetings were then extended to the project team to make sure that they 
understood the strategy and how it was going to  be accomplished.  There were strategic 
corrections throughout the project, but Lunar Pros pector wanted to be very sure that people did 
not misinterpret faster, better, cheaper as being a license to be ‘sloppy.’  This meant defining the 
requirements early and sticking to them.  Wi th such a short development time and limited 
Lunar Prospector 16resources, Lunar Prospector believed they could not  afford or allow requirements to grow.  Lunar 
Prospector wanted to make sure that everyone understood that they should focus on things that 
were truly value-added or contributed to mission success and not on things that provided minimal 
value.  Additionally, Lunar Prospector m anagement built a strategic focus on a: 
• Clear Set of Requirements : Requirements were not only clearly defined but people 
adhered to them. 
• Defined Roles and Responsibilities :  Team members and management know their 
roles and responsibilities from the begi nning and there was neve any question. 
• Mix of Experience :  Experienced people at the top combined with energetic young 
engineers. 
• Willingness to do Things Differently :  Lunar Prospector was unique in how it was 
selected, managed, and developed.  People were willing to try a different way of doing 
business. 
• Strong Sense of what was Mission Success  
Strong commitment from Top Management :  Consistent funding stream from top 
management, which did not waiver from the commitment. 
• Extensive Pre-project Definition : A long history of studies and missions to the Moon, 
which gave a solid basis of the science requirements.  
• Focused Management Team :  The focus of all of the managers was on making Lunar 
Prospector successful.  When problems arose,  the management set aside differences to 
keep the project directed with a common goal of doing it appropriately and timely. 
Lunar Prospector 17Project Spirit and Leadership  
 
“Things that we did which were unheard of, all goes  into my saying that nobody believed that we 
could do this.” 
- Alan Binder, personal interview 
 
Organizational Culture 
 
“You’ve got to change the culture, you can’t do th ings this way if you’re going to keep the old 
culture.” 
- Alan Binder, personal interview  
 
For Lunar Prospector there was the culture of a sma ll project built into a large organization.  As a 
large organization, Lockheed Martin, has a tendenc y to manage projects from the top with a 
significant amount of top m anagement oversight.  For Lunar Prospector where the team was 
considered small compared to most planetary missions, people were involved from beginning to 
end of the project.  Engineers that were involved in  the design process were involved in the test 
program; launch integration and many of them were  sitting at the consoles during launch.  There 
was a feeling of real identity with the hardware and what they were trying to do and this instilled a 
unique feeling of being part of something that was different.   
 
Project Spirit 
 
“People that I run into today say that LP was the best team and the best project that they had 
ever worked on.” 
- Sylvia Cox, personal interview 
 When Binder was asked about project spirit, he r eplied, “Without that we would have never had 
achieved anything.”  Binder believ ed and stated constantly that if  you were not having fun you 
should get off the program and go somewhere else .  Alan Maloney wrote at the end of his paper 
published in an engineering journal, “Alan, we all had fun.”  Lunar Prospector believed that project 
spirit was built on the people.  Hubbard stated that one of the keys  to Lunar Prospector was that 
the people involved brought a lot of experience and dedi cation to doing things in a different way.  
There was a common understanding of the chall enge and a dedication from everyone involved.  
Binder also believed that understanding the history of  the project was critical to project success 
and building project spirit. So one of the first things he did was to sit the engineers down and 
explain the philosophy, history, and what Lunar Prospector was trying to accomplish.  Binder 
wanted the project members to feel committed to  the project and think of it as a traditional 
aerospace contract.  Although this task took much  effort and received resistance from some of 
the engineer’s, it became pivotal in build  a foundation for the project spirit. 
 Lunar Prospector believed that the project spirit had to be experienced as much as it was felt.  
They developed project logo stickers and patc hes, which appeared on everything from notebooks 
to janitor’s barrels.  One of the most unique and cl ever project spirit activities was after the 
announcement was made that water was discover ed on the lunar surface, Lockheed Martin 
project members put out a Lunar Prospector wate r bottle with a Lunar Prospector logo and some 
clever sayings on the side (e.g. Moonshine).  NASA was in the developments of a slogan that 
would be the foundation of future planetary missions  – Water, Life, Origins.  Lunar Prospector 
gave that slogan and NASA hope that life could exists away from Earth.  Project team members 
fostered these events, but as an or ganization Lockheed Martin did little to nurture a project spirit.  
When it was announced that Lunar Prospector was selected, Lockheed Martin did little to 
congratulate the project team, while Martin Marie tta, winner of the other two Discovery proposals, 
through a large dinner party for all of the people involved.  Throughout the project it was the 
Lunar Prospector 18project team and not the parent organization, Lockheed Martin, which fostered and nurtured the 
project spirit.  Despite what rituals and ceremonies there were to foster a project spirit, most team 
members will tell you that it was the success of the mission and their knowi ng that they were a 
critical part of it that fostered and maintained the spirit.  
Policy to Support Strategy and Spirit 
 
“Are you familiar with Lockheed skunkworks?   Well this was a super skunkworks” 
- Alan Binder, personal interview 
 When Hubbard was asked if Lunar Prospector has a policy to support the strategy he simply 
stated, “To a certain extent we were making it up as we went.”  The management of Lunar 
Prospector had a vision on how Lunar Prospector could be accomplished in a very cost 
constrained environment.  Some of this was usi ng existing Lockheed Martin policy directives and 
not writing an Ames plan or a NASA plan.  By  doing this Lunar Prospector was able to keep 
documentation to a minimum, and allow the team to  concentrate on the project engineering.  This 
allowed engineers to do what they loved, be engi neers.  Alan Binder believed that people were 
the keepers and the communicators of the know ledge, so he relied on people’s tacit knowledge 
and open communication to keep the project moving and motivated. 
 
To accomplish this, Lunar Prospector believed t hat to be successful they needed a team of good 
engineers and no bureaucracy.  Binder stated from the st art of the project that in order for Lunar 
Prospector to be successful they had to meet t hese two criteria.  Lockheed-Martin said they 
would give Lunar Prospector the companies’ bes t engineers and lift all the bureaucratic barriers, 
but Binder does not believe they did.   
 
Leadership 
 
As a management team Binder and Dougherty worked each other’s skills to move the project 
forward.  Binder understood the technical thoroughly, and while Dougherty may not have 
understood the system as well, he managed t he money and personnel, as Binder put it, 
“beautifully.”  Binder and Dougherty believed t hat management should be working managers.  As 
Binder stated,  
 
I was not the manager who sat in my big soft chair somewhere and just wrote memos.  I was down there, they know that  they could come in and talk to me and 
tell me anything they needed to do and I worked with them – they did not work for 
me.  Slowly but surely as the progr am went on even though these guys thought I 
was totally wacko for trying to do w hat they thought c ould not be done they 
began to see that it was working. 
 As the Principle Investigator, Binder was in c harge of the science in addition to being the lead for 
the project.  He set a standard of open comm unication, but made no doubts that he was in 
charge.  As he stated, “I believe absolutely in di ctatorships.  You get now here by doing things by 
committee.”  Binder believed that in a FBC proj ect an individual has to step forward and lead the 
project.  They must be willing to take responsibility,  make decisions and stick to their decision.  If 
someone on the project cannot work in this env ironment then they should be removed from the 
project.  The counter to this, Binder also believ ed that this person must be willing to take blame 
when something goes wrong. Binder believed that w hoever is going to run the program has to be 
willing to standup and say they screwed up.  If they are successful then credit will come to them, 
but they have to be willing to take the blame and as Binder stated, “very few people are willing to 
do that.” 
 
Lunar Prospector 19Dougherty believed in including people in t he decision making process and then making a 
decision, telling them why he made that decision,  and then moving on. He did not spend a lot of 
time on decision-making processes and rarely was any decision stalled for more than a week.  
Dougherty was a motivational manager and believed in  instilling confidence in the team members 
so they would not doubt his decisions.   Hubbard believed in working hard at the front-end of a 
project to establish the requirements and then let a capable team do what they are trained to do.  
He did not believe in micro managing.  H ubbard believed that he should manage by delegation 
and hold people accountable to high-level requirem ents rather than detailed specifications.  
Hubbard believed that a significant amount of effo rt should be put up front to ensure the project 
go off to a proper start.  This meant a certai n degree of control and engagement in the contract 
process and the early definition.  But once Hubbard felt it was clear that the project was heading 
in the right direction, he was hands-off and le tting the project go where it needed to go.   
 
Team Empowerment 
 
“It was very much by delegation and holding people accountable to high level requirements rather 
than detailed specifications.” 
- Scott Hubbard, personal interview 
 
Lunar Prospector worked hard to try and empower t he project team.  The shear virtue of NASA 
not inserting how Lunar Prospector was managed gav e empowerment to the project team.  Tom 
Dougherty brought a philosophy about management that made the people responsible in the 
decision making process.  Management believed t hat you let people know their job and let them 
do it.  With responsibility came accountability.  If any person failed in their responsibility, they 
were responsible to fix it.  Conversely, if they  did a good job, they got the pat on the back they 
deserved.  To do this Lunar Prospector believed in  hiring competent people.  People were put in 
charge of not just specific parts  of a subsystem but whole subsys tems.  Cox stated that this was 
harder for some because “…they were used to  maybe worrying about t he component system and 
they had the whole power subsystem.  They had to worry about the solar arrays and the solar 
cells and the power budget.”  Many of team me mbers found the scope of their jobs almost 
intimidating.  While some were able to step up to  the challenge, others had trouble.  This is where 
Dougherty’s people managing skills became critical.  He was able to adapt specific individuals to 
tasks they were capable of and motivate or intimi date people to take ownership.  Cox says that 
Dougherty was successful because he looked at the individual and tried to motivate them to do 
the job he felt they were capable of doing.  
 
Hubbard said that one of the keys to empowering the project team was having the ability to say, 
“No.”  He states that routinel y a company such as Lockheed Martin is “accustomed to working for 
different customers and they would come and say ok Mr. Customer, Mr. DoD, or NASA what do 
you want us to do next?  Or, what do you do about this?  And we would say no, no, no.  You don’t 
get it we are holding you accountable for deliver ing a spacecraft that works.  What do you 
propose to do about it?  Give us your options and then you’re proposed solutions and if it seems 
reasonable we’ll go with it.”  
Lunar Prospector 20Organization  
 
Project Organization 
 
“He who defines the program, designs the hardw are; he who designs the hardware, tests the 
hardware; he who tests the hardware, flies the hardware.  It was a cradle to grave program.” 
 - Alan Binder, personal interview  
Lunar Prospector was small compared to most N ASA sponsored missions, but this is one of the 
factors that made Lunar Prospecto r innovative.  The contractor , Lockheed-Martin in Sunnyvale, 
California, has a workforce no more than forty or  fifty people.  NASA’s main contribution came 
from the Ames Research Center (ARC) through tw o distinct groups: the mission office, which was 
responsible for managerial oversight for the pr oject, two to three people; and the NASA project 
team, which was people actually working on the project, six people. In addition to the Lockheed-
Martin contractors, there were  co-investigators at various in stitutions around the country: Los 
Alamos National Laboratory, University of Calif ornia-Berkley, University of Arizona, Goddard 
Space Flight Center, and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. 
 
Structure 
 
Lockheed Martin implemented the project under a NASA contract.  The Project Manager within 
Lockheed Martin, Tom Dougherty reported to the Prin cipal Investigator (PI), Alan Binder.  At the 
start of the project, Lockheed Martin employed Bi nder.  Later Binder started his own non-profit 
company, Lunar Research Institute.  Normally the science PI is not  from a company, but part of a 
university, so this was a unique situation.  The PI is responsible for setting out the scientific 
requirements of the mission and the day-to-day project management  responsiblity was with the 
Project Manager.  The PI worked directly with co-investigators who woul d provide instruments 
and/or scientific analysis.  Something that was unus ual to this project was that Lockheed Martin 
was made the single prime contra ctor and they sub-contracted wi th all other parties involved University of California, Berkley University of Arizona

Figure 2: Organization Chart 
Lunar Prospector 21(except other NASA agencies).  This did creat e some bureaucratic issues, but they were 
overcome.  The actual delivery schedules came from the Lockheed Martin’s project office, and 
the contract between Lockheed Mart in and the government to deliver a working spacecraft was 
the responsibility of ARC.    
The organization was flat with lines of communica tion kept lean and accountability kept firm.  To 
be successful, Dougherty believed that co-location was critical.  One of the first things he did was 
get the team co-located.  They were located in one building in what Lockheed Martin called a 
pod, which made everyone no more than 50 or  100 feet of anyone.  Binder and Dougherty 
worked every single day with every single engi neer in the trenches.  Lunar Prospector had one 
engineer who was responsible for each subsystem.  As Binder stated, “There was no passing the 
buck here, there was no saying some of my guys screwed up.  He was it.”   
 
Team Assembly 
 
“You can’t let people just keep their job bec ause they are there warming the chair.”  
- Alan Binder, personal interview 
 Binder does not contest the critics that say FB C is hard.  He says that you have to have 
competent, dedicated people who are led by som eone who know what he or she is doing, and 
that is difficult to come by. With Lunar Pros pector, Dougherty handpicked m any of the engineers.  
Traditionally within Lockheed Martin people ar e selected from individual departments based on 
skill sets.  This can take time because these people have to be requested and transitioned 
through a normal process of selection.  Be cause Dougherty had years of experience with 
Lockheed Martin and an established network, he was able to select the talent needed to make 
Lunar Prospector happen.  Dougherty also believ ed that you have to be able to manage those 
people’s time, a valuable resource.  When a person was not necessary or having work to perform, Dougherty would put them on another program  for a week.  He was able to strategically 
manage personnel to optimize budgetary constr ains.  Binder and Dougherty only had people 
working on the project who had something to do.   For Dougherty is was a balancing act between 
people with minimal cost (usually junior people) and those with senior level experience.  The co-
investigators were picked on the basis of t heir track record in supplying instruments and 
knowledge about lunar science.  The NASA (A RC) people were selected by Hubbard based on 
their work on other programs.   
 
Responsibilities 
 
“People basically were given overall authority for a specific subsystem or  a specific task and then 
they were expected to go do it.” 
 -Sylvia Cox, personal interview 
 Lunar Prospector had one engineer in charge of each subsystem and they were the responsible 
person for that subsystem.  Each person knew t hat their work was critic al and that they were 
responsible for it and they could go to management without repercussion  
 
For Lunar Prospector, people had well defined and s pecific responsibility and each person knew 
what was their responsibility.  They were told  very early in the process what was their 
responsibility and each person knew their work wa s critical and they knew they could go to 
management without repercussion.  Management sat down with each specific area of the project 
and asked the individual responsible for that area to  come up with milestones of what they felt 
would show they were making progress on a monthly basis.  Then management negotiated with 
the individual the definition of those milestones.  With this process they tailored for each 
subsystem in the project a way of keeping tabs  on whether they were making progress on their 
Lunar Prospector 22path.  The whole delegation of work was the respons ibility of the individual within the constraints 
of meeting the milestones.   
 
Top Management Involvement 
 
A combined program and project management from the Lunar Prospector Mission Office (LPMO) 
at NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) managed Lunar Prospector.  This office was responsible 
for being the single point of contact to the Prin ciple Investigator and the Lockheed Martin (LMMS) 
Staff.  Lunar Prospector wanted to maintain l ean management staff with clearly defined roles and 
lines of communication.  Hubbard believed that  it was necessary to limit the detailed 
specifications given to the contractor and let them work from high-level requirements.  He 
believed that you find a contractor  with a depth of experience and let them do their job.  In this 
case it was Lockheed Martin with over thirty y ears worth of development ex perience in the private 
sector.  Hubbard stated that judgments were made up front about risk areas and working the 
insight and oversight.  Hubbard termed this “pr ogrammatic oversight and technical insight.” 
 
Top management at NASA gave the project team  of Lunar Prospector as much freedom as 
possible to accomplish the mission.  As Alan Binder  stated, “NASA kept saying, ‘Oh, my God; we 
don’t like this we’re never going to do this again,’ because they had no control (personal 
interview)” NASA top management left the Lunar Pros pector team alone, and felt that as long as 
things were moving along they would stay out of it.  This was true until it got close to launch and 
the reality of a possible failure became more r ealistic.  This was because Lunar Prospector was 
going to launch on an unproven launch vehicl e that had never been used before.  Top 
management then became very involve with some extensive reviews.  Cox recollected, “Tom 
Dougherty had run the first Hubble servicing mission and he told me that by the time they got 
ready to go they had 25 independent review committees  looking at them. He predicted that the 
closer we got launch the more reviews woul d come and the more nervous headquarters would 
become.  And he was absolutely dead on right.” 
 
Professional Advise and Reviews 
 
“Simple and frequent review meetings allow quick responsiveness.  Not everyone must 
participate, but they must be available.  It can be done quickly and allow for quick feedback and 
continuous monitoring of cost and progress.” 
 - Sylvia Cox, ASK Magazine  
Great attempts were made to make sure that  reviews were based on quality and not quantity. The 
numbers and lengths of reviews were kept to  a minimum and Binder even changed the names of 
the reviews to minimize the attendance at these reviews to the critical minimum.  Doughtery 
believed that reviews were critical to projec t success, and stressed that reviews should be seen 
as opportunities and not a trial.  He believed that the review committee should be just as 
accountable with providing potential trades and solutions as the team was for meeting 
developmental objectives.  Reviews (formal or informal) were frequent and based on a systematic 
and simple monitoring system.  Doughtery impl emented weekly subsystem reviews and everyone 
on the team had to make him or herself av ailable to immediately solve problems. 
 
Lunar Prospector was asked from the onset to  have an independent (informal) review team.  
Hubbard took this very seriously and hand pick ed a review committee that he believed NASA 
headquarters would have unquestionably confidence in.  To head the committee he got Jim 
Martin, Viking Program Manager, he also got a former Vice President at Martin Marietta, and representatives from other N ASA centers to get across agency support and input.  Hubbard got a 
very high level, extremely experienced set of revi ewers to participate in this review team.  The 
annual reviews with the independent review team were  then tied to milestones in the project to 
Lunar Prospector 23give the review team and the project team tar get items to focus on.  These reviews became a 
mechanism by which the review process was st reamlined.  It cut the amount of reporting and the 
number of times they spent doing reviews.  Many of the standard NASA reviews (i.e. test 
readiness review, pre-ship review) were incorporat ed into these annual reviews.  A keynote to the 
formal reviews and this review committee was that  they had no authority over the project, only the 
ability to recommend.  The Lunar Prospector team did not consider most of the recommendations 
of the formal review because they did not hav e the time or money to implement them.  
 
Because the amount of money spent on Lunar Pr ospector was minimal compared to other NASA 
missions, the amount of reviews was not consider ed an issue.  Cox says, “By the time they 
considered it an issue frankly it was too la te.”  Although all managers in Lunar Prospector 
attribute part of their success to the advice and guidance in the informal review from proven and 
successful project managers in the area of planetary exploration and project management.  
Specifically the advice of James Martin, Vi king Project Manager, and Charlie Hall, Project 
Manager of the Pioneer exploration series.  Bo th of these men provided thorough critique of 
Lunar Prospector and whether they were managi ng risk and budget properly.  Martin held the 
position of chair of all of Lunar Prospectors exte rnal review boards, and was cited by all of the 
Lunar Prospector managers as a key component to pr oviding the exact level of external guidance 
to allow Lunar Prospector to be successful wit hout being held back by bureaucratic requirements. 
 
Organizational Problems 
 
It was clear with every team member that probl ems would only cause delays in the project, which 
would result in cancellation.  Therefore, ever y issue was addressed right then and there with each 
person knowing their responsibility and only one person being responsible.  If there was any 
significant conflict in Lunar Prospector, it was between Alan Binder and Scott Hubbard.  Alan 
Binder truly believed that a PI, science led missi on could be accomplished faster, better, cheaper.  
And Binder believed that the best way to accomp lish this was to give him the money he need and 
let him foster his vision without any constraint s (oversight).  Hubbard’s vision was similar to 
Binder’s in that he wanted to prove that fast er, better, cheaper could be successful, but Binder 
and Hubbard disagreed about the how.  Alan believ ed very strongly in what his vision was 
whereas Hubbard believed very strongly that  NASA had responsibility to have oversight and 
insight into what was going on with the mission.  Co x described this as a conflict in vision.   In 
many cases Binder and Hubbard agreed to disagree.  
 
Training 
 
As with most fast paced project, training on Lunar Prospector either received prior to the project 
start of on-the-job.  Most of  the managers did not have formal managerial training, but brought to 
the project a wealth of experience.   
 
Lunar Prospector 24Processes  
 Project Phases and Reviews 
 NASA has a defined formal five-phase process for projects (A, B, C, D, and E).  Each phase 
represent a progression in development and can be characterized as a stage-gate process. For 
Lunar Prospector Phase A (concept study) was already  complete before the project got started.  
For Phase B (design study), Binder and a group of  volunteer engineers from Hughes were able to 
complete with support funding from the Space Sc ience Institute, so Phase B was completed 
before the project got started.  For the first six months of the project, Lunar Prospector went 
through a Phase CB (technical design review ).  Management approached these reviews as 
scheduled checkpoints based on time and not comple tion of project phases.  Therefore, if a 
subsystem was ahead of schedule, it did not slow  down (as long as there was no impact on the 
system) to wait for approval from the formal review board. 
 Communications 
 
Lunar Prospector kept meetings to a minimum and wo rked to make sure that the time spent in 
meetings was effective and efficient.  Every M onday morning they had a staff meeting to address 
objectives for the week, and every Wednesday t hey had a subsystem review so engineers could 
address the issues. Dougherty felt that if they  found out a problem Monday, they had it finished 
by Friday.  If they didn’t find out about it until W ednesday it went into the next week.  Binder said 
these pointed meetings were critical.  These week ly meetings covered the current status of the 
project, key issues, and overall pr oject process.  They were team meetings and not solely 
controlled by management.  Management was open with  all team members at these meeting on 
issues of budget and schedule, and were always l ooking for input from the team on how to do 
things better.  Communication was open and problem solving was real-time.  
If someone had a problem with a subsystem that wa s not addressed in a meeting they went to 
Binder and/or Dougherty and it was dealt with immedi ately.  As Binder stated, “We were always 
within five minutes of a problem.”  Communi cation was open door and co-location critical.  As 
Binder stated, “having everybody  within shouting distance” was critical, and made communication 
personal and instantaneous.  Cox tells recollects, “The fact that I could get in my car and drive for 
ten minutes and be at Lockheed in the building, I was back and forth every day, just about.  There 
were some days when I wasn’t there or here ac tually.  The same thing was true between Scott 
and myself.  Scott was the Mission Manager.  I had ready access to him if I felt like I needed it as 
his onsite Manager of Lockheed.  So I felt like we had a very streamlined and efficient 
communication process and that co-location was a big piece of it.  Binder prides himself on 
saying that he did not write any memos; it was done face-to-face.  Binder’s persistence in face-to-
face communication is best described as, 
 
I want to talk to people because agai n when you write an email especially 
between scientists and engineers even though I’m well versed in engineering you 
don’t speak the same language.  You cannot  communicate in the written word 
the way you can if you stand in front  of a guy and you see the guy isn’t 
comprehending what you say or vice a versa.   
 
When Cox was asked what forms of communicati on were used, she simply answered, “It was 
almost all verbal communication.”  Hubbard st ated that this open, frequent communications made 
all the difference in Lunar Prospector.  They were able to work problems as they came up 
identifying them and not let them fester. They wo rked to be very proactive and try to figure out 
where the next problem might arise.  Cox stated, “I was totally tr eated like I was a member of the 
team.  There were no meetings that I couldn’t go in there wasn’t anything hidden from me. I saw 
Lunar Prospector 25all the reports they made to the management.  It was a very open process.  And I think that really 
contributed to people feeling like t hey were part of the team.” 
 
Lunar Prospector had a monthly reporting require ment to NASA management at ARC.  Cox 
states that this monthly reporting mechanism s hould be a confirmation of everything she already 
knew.  She believed that if she were really pay ing attention to the project, then she would not 
need a report to inform her of the projects progress.    
 
Resource Management  “I had periods where the cost constraints and the inherent difficulties of space hardware 
development made me wonder if we were goi ng to get this project off the ground.” 
 - Sylvia Cox, ASK Magazine  
Lunar Prospector believed resources was scarce and t here was no room for error or contingency.  
They believed that the requirements were set early and you had to stick to them.  As Binder 
states, “This is why faster, better cheaper is tough to do.”  Binder believes that in most aerospace 
projects engineers design for plenty of cont ingency, but contingency cost money.  The 
unforeseen events occur; the more requirements begin to grow over the life of the project.  Lunar 
Prospector would not tolerate a requirements growth .  They paid a great deal of attention after the 
initial distribution of costs to each subsystem and who was charging to the program and why. Cox 
says, “This is why most projects get in troubl e with costs, because for the most part managers 
really don’t pay attention until a project is in tr ouble and then it’s too late.”  Dougherty paid very 
close attention to resources, especially human resources.  They would look across Lockheed 
Martin and question anyone that they were unsur e about that was charging time against Lunar 
Prospector.  If Dougherty or Binder questioned someone charging time to Lunar Prospector and 
no one could explain then that per son was questioned or removed. 
 
Reducing Uncertainty 
 “You fly what you test and test what you fly. 
- Aerospace Proverb   
 
The results of reduced technical uncertainty  can sometimes mean increase spending.  Lunar 
Prospector’s budget was based on a bare minimum.  Binder believed that the only way that Lunar 
Prospector was going to stay on budget and keep the costs down was to go “single string.”  Lunar 
Prospector believed the answer to reducing tec hnical uncertainty and budget was to minimize 
redundancy and test, test, test. They  viewed testing as the way of being sure that a cost 
constrained approach was going to work.  Therefor e, they spend a lot of discussion on how much 
testing was enough testing and which tests were cr itical.  There was not only no backups, but no 
test model.  The spacecraft that was tested was the one that flew.  Binder tells a story of when 
Lunar Prospector was tested in the thermal vacuum chamber that is the example of why testing 
was so important to Lunar Prospector’ s reduction in technical uncertainty. 
 
The people in NASA didn’t think that you could build a spacecraft the way we were proposing to do for the costs.  So when we got ready for thermal vac test 
and I’m sure you know that that’s the big test.  Lockheed’s history and all the 
aerospace history is you go into therma l vac and find out what’s wrong with the 
spacecraft, you take it out and fix it, and put it back into the thermal vac.  And you 
find if anything else is wrong and you might have to go in a third time.  We had a ten-day test cycle.  There were two hot  and two cold cycles.  We reserved the 
chamber for two weeks.  And hoped that t hat would do.  We went and put it in 
there and got it all setup and closed the door pumped down for a day, and cooled 
Lunar Prospector 26down for a day and seven days later walked out with the perfect spacecraft.  At 
that point I knew that everything t hat I had proposed in the whole concept 
worked, because we had just flown the mi ssion in thermal vac.  That had never 
happened in the history of Lockheed or probabl y in the history of aerospace.   
 
The most perceived critical risk that receiv ed the most attention was the launch of Lunar 
Prospector on the unproven Athena II launch vehicle.  During the first uses of a new commercial 
launch facility at Cape Canaveral, Florida t here had been several commercial satellite and launch 
vehicle failures (e.g. Pegasus, Arianne V).  Bec ause of these recent failures, and it being the 
maiden launch for the Athena II, Lunar Prospector w ent through extensive re views. They spent 
months and months with a Marshall/KSC review  committee to convince top management that 
there was not a high risk in launching Lunar Prospecto r.  It wasn’t the dollars invested into Lunar 
Prospector that was of such concern, but how  the people outside of NASA would perceive it if 
there was a launch failure.         
 
Systems Engineering 
 
All the managers for Lunar Prospector state that t hey did nothing unusual in  the area of systems 
engineering.  They used many of the standard te chniques.  What they will tell you was unique 
with Lunar Prospector was how the people deal t with and managed the subsystems.   The 
exception was that people, who wrote the requirements, were  the people who monitored the 
requirements, were the people who were involved in  systems integration.  The same core of 
subsystems engineers did all of the work that wa s done on the requirements and all of the work in 
terms of evaluating performance throughout the mission.    
Lunar Prospector worked hard to cut costs and in order to accomplish this they streamlined 
processes that normally were performed by mult iple groups and put the process into one team.  
An example of this was the wiring for the spacecra ft was all performed in house.  Normally time is 
spent developing wiring diagrams and these are then turned over to a wire shop who then turn 
the final product over to a spacecraft integration group.  For Lunar Prospector, all three of these 
phases were consolidated into one, and the spacecra ft was wired in real time.  This meant that 
there was no room for error; one fault meant t hat the mission would be over.    Although this 
method cut cost and time it increased risk.  The true challenge to this as Binder stated was that 
when you do this with a tight schedule and tight  budget, you have to have excellent engineers.  
When it came to design and requirements docum entation, in many cases ‘redlines’ were 
accepted without being incorporated in to the final document.  It was a work-it-out-as-you-go 
mentality.  
 Risk Management 
 
Lunar Prospector believed that risk management c ould be handled with simplicity and looking at 
the spacecraft with a systems perspective.  Cox said  that when you consider the integration of the 
subsystems, you begin to see the risks. Lunar Prospector had a list of the top five risks and 
tracked what they believed the risks were in each subsystem.  Dougherty monitored the whole 
project on the wall in his office by looking at the budget, the mass, and the power, and everyone 
in charge of each subsystem took accountability for their part.  Binder  firmly believed the first step 
in risk management was having someone that woul d be willing to take responsibility for the 
mission and the failures.  It was a factor of pers onal responsibility with the project leaders and the 
team members.  Also, Lunar Prospector believed that you fly what you test and test what you fly.  
They selected flight proven har dware whenever possible and tested everything in every possible 
scenario. Binder stated that Lunar Prospec tor’s risk management was simplicity, 
straightforwardness, and minimal operational requirements.   
 
Lunar Prospector 27Customer Involvement 
 
Lunar Prospector made it very clear and distinct t hat they had three customers: the Office of 
Space Science at NASA Headquarters and the Disco very Program, the sponsor; the scientific 
community, user of the data; and the general public.  
Contractor Involvement 
 
“We got the subcontractors realizing that  they were part of a real adventure.” 
- Scott Hubbard, personal interview 
 
Lunar Prospector believed that vendor involvem ent was critical to mission success and getting 
the designs they needed and in a timely manor.  Managers from Lunar Prospector would go to 
the individual vendors and tell them exactly what  they wanted the equipment for, why they 
needed it early, and what it meant to the project.  They made a personal visit to every major 
vendor and made sure he or she was part of the t eam from the beginning.  At every visit they 
emphasized the spirit of Lunar Prospector and made su re that the vendor bought into this spirit.  
They contest that this was why they got t he best hardware that they could build.  Lunar 
Prospector may have used existing hardware, but t hey received it in half the normal development 
time and at significantly reduced costs. 
 
Lunar Prospector 28Tools  
 
For Lunar Prospector there were no unique tools us ed to manage the project.  The one tool that 
was used by Lunar Prospector, is used by m any NASA space science projects, and unique to 
NASA is Earned Value Management (EVM). EVM is a standard NASA way of running planetary 
flight projects and performance metrics.  EVM is based on a set of project tasks, and each task 
has a cost to complete and/or items to procure.  Each task and procurement has a schedule for completion, and as each one is completed a monetar y credit is assigned.  These credits are then 
graphed against how much money has been spent t hus far on the project to determine where 
project progress follows on the curve.  
 
Knowledge Management 
 
“You don’t have information being passed on by documents that no one r eads and even if they 
did you know as well as I do that no two people understand the same thing the same way.” 
 - Alan Binder, personal interview 
 
Lunar Prospector kept documentation to a minimum, and did not spend time producing 
documentation that would not be used or read.  Binder  believes that there is a loss of information 
in excessive documentation.  He sa ys that there is a loss of info rmation in the translation as the 
document is passed on.  Binder says that the people are the key to passing information.  This is 
why Lunar Prospector believed in keeping people on t he project cradle to grave.  Traditionally 
within NASA or most large aerospace companies somebody defines the P hase A, and then writes 
a report.  This is then passed on to the people t hat will define the Phase B and they will write a 
report. This process is followed through all phases.  In the end, a final report and specifications 
document is passed on to the team that will build  the spacecraft.  Lunar Prospector believed that 
this just generates a number of reports that no one reads and this information is passed on to 
people that will be building the spacecraft, and have not written a single requirement or 
specification.  That is why they believed in  the cradle to grave mechanism for retaining and 
passing knowledge.  
Alan Binder tells the story of why Lunar Prospec tor believed knowledge was in the people and not 
the documentation: 
 
Because we had minimal documentation when we had our reviews we caught holy hell because there wasn’t a stack of doc uments.  And so Jim Martin said we 
want some documents the next time we come here.  So Tom and I said ok guys 
every engineer write up some documents.  Tom and I never looked at them; we 
signed them.  We had a stack of docum ents nobody read, had them on the table 
when the review committee came back for the next review, and they said ok we 
see your documentation; fine. 
 
Learning Process 
 
It can be assumed that because Lunar Prospector di d not believe in a lot of documentation, 
lessons learned were not a critical part of the pos t-project activity.  Hubbar d et.al. wrote several 
papers documenting some to the scientific and managerial lessons learned from Lunar Prospector.  These papers were presented at se veral conferences and meetings.  In addition 
Hubbard participated in NASA Shared Experiences APPL  training program.  But, for the most part 
little effort or emphasis was put on lessons learned.  Most managers expressed that Lunar 
Prospector was very unique and the culture and environment that made Lunar Prospector 
successful may be difficult to repeat in the current NASA culture. 
Lunar Prospector 29Adapting Project Management to Project Type 
 
Lunar Prospector was a strategic project centered on a new research effort to explore the moon.  
Exploration of the moon of this magnitude had not occurred in more than 20 years (since Apollo).  
Lunar Prospector would sustain NASA’s position in space exploration and significantly expand 
our knowledge of the moon.  In addition, Lunar Pros pector would represent the first competitively 
selected Discovery Program mission.  The ta sk outcome for Lunar Prospector was a tangible 
product of a spacecraft, orbiter, and scientific  instruments.  Lunar Prospector required a 
significant level of insight and creativity both technically and managerially built around a core of 
talented, experienced people to produce a val ued product.  The scientific community defined 
Lunar Prospector’s scientific objective s; therefore, there was an obligat ion to satisfy their external 
customer with scientific data.  While there was a project commitm ent to the scientific community, 
it was the financial commitment from the N ASA Discovery Program that would define Lunar 
Prospector by their internal customer.  W hen defining project success and making strategic 
decisions, Lunar Prospector was more concerned with their internal customer, NASA.   
 
The NCTP Model below represents the analysis of Lunar Prospector in respects to its Novelty, 
Complexity, Technology, and Pace.  Connecting the NCTP classification with a straight line to 
form a diamond, gives a representation of the leve l of risk associated with a project.  The greater 
the area of the diamond, the great er the degree of risk.  While there is not a linear relationship 
between the area of the diamond for correct and in correct project risk, it can represent a 
difference in the degree of risk.

Lunar Prospector 30Novelty :  Lunar Prospector was a breakthrough product.  The technology used in Lunar 
Prospector was a new use for existing technology  which aerospace had never seen before, and it 
pushed the boundaries of cost-effective space explor ation.  While there was much to be learned 
from Apollo, these early lunar missions onl y opened 20% of our understanding of the Moon, and 
little had been accomplished in lunar exploration si nce Apollo.  Therefore, Lunar Prospector was 
based largely on scientific fundamentals, with limit ed experience in similar products and history of 
trial and error.  This meant fast prototypi ng, keeping a close, honest relationship with its 
customer, and late design freezes. 
 
Complexity :  Lunar Prospector was a system project.  As complex integration of scientific 
instruments and spacecraft subsys tems, Lunar Prospector was lead by a main program office, 
NASA Ames Research Center, directing a prim e contractor, Lockheed-Martin.  There were 
several other subcontractors to produce the scient ific instruments with a mix of in-house and 
external development.  While Lockheed-Martin m anaged the project, it was NASA-Ames’ ultimate 
responsibility to be accountable for the spacecraft.  While the documentation was kept minimal, 
with any complex NASA project, the documentation is extensive compared to most projects.  As 
an organization, Lunar Prospector was a pure project st ructure with tight control over the project 
and extensive reviews with the customer.  Lunar  Prospector had multiple key customers from 
industry, public, government, and the scientific community that were all vested in Lunar 
Prospector’s development and success.  As a sy stems project Lunar Prospector was a complex 
project that required extensive planning, com puterized tools and software, hundreds or thousands 
of activities, tight and formal control, financ ial and schedule issues, and reviews with customers 
and management. 
 Technology :  Lunar Prospector was a high-technology project.  As a product, Lunar Prospector 
was not revolutionary but maintained a simple design using proven technology with only a few 
new iterations of those technologies.  Although most of the technology was commercial-off-the-
shelf or borrowed from other proven spacecraft, it wa s innovative in its application.  With a simple 
design (by NASA standards), the project still in volved long periods of design, development, 
testing, and redesign with multiple design cycles t hat had to start before the project started.  With 
the extensive testing that was required for a high-tech project like Lunar Prospector, in depth, 
technical reviews were mandatory to make a projec t of this complexity successful.  In conjunction 
with these reviews, communication had to be frequent and active.  The complexity and 
communication demands required management to be of good technical skills and intimately 
involved in the project.  They also had to recognize the unique challenges of CONTOUR and be 
flexible to extensive testing and design changes .  Therefore, design freezes had to be scheduled 
and as late as possible.  Lunar Prospector had a clear understanding of the complexity of the 
technology they were dealing with, and applied the ri ght level of design constraints to the project 
to assure success. 
 
Pace :  Lunar Prospector was a blitz-critical projec t.  All Discovery Program missions are under a 
contained development time, and any delays in that would mean canc ellation of the mission.  As 
a pure project, the team was specially assemb led because of their unique and valued capabilities, 
and team members were only retained because they brought value to the project.  When a crisis 
arose, it was dealt with in a quick and effectiv e manor.  People were open with in any crisis, 
realizing the end goal was more important.  With a shortened development time, many 
bureaucratic policies were lifted and procedures we re kept to the core minimum.  Project 
managers were very involved in the project from beginning to end, and were never afraid to “pick 
up a wrench” to guarantee project success.  In addition, management up the chain never 
questioned the status of the project.  They were k ept informed while allowing the project team the 
freedom to get the project done. 
Lunar Prospector 31 
Success Factors 
Lunar Prospector understood well before the project st arted that simplicity would be the key to 
project success.  Lunar Prospector was well def ined with a clear understanding of the scope, 
technical uncertainty, and pace.  This guided m anagement toward design constraints that kept 
Lunar Prospector on budge and on time.  Key to Lunar Prospector’s success were: 
 
• Strategy 
o Strategy was determined before project started 
o Strategy was focused and clear 
o Continued articulation of the strategy 
o Objectives were simple, attainable, and valuable 
o Defined objectives based on customer needs 
• Spirit 
o Focused, unspoken, common commitment to mission success 
o Willingness to do things differently 
• Organization 
o Co-location 
o Limited involvement from top-management, but strong committment 
o Defined roles and responsibilities 
o People worked the project from beginning to end 
o Maintained only a core workforce 
o Mix of experience 
• Processes 
o Stuck to the requirements 
o Test, test, test with quality, not quantity 
o Contractors were part of the project team 
o Informal (peer) reviews: quality, not quantity 
o Focused meetings 
 
Lunar Prospector had an extensive pre-project defin ition period that was based on a long history 
of studies of lunar missions which gave a solid basis of the science and spacecraft requirements.  
Lunar Prospector realized that to be successful under the constraints of a Discovery Program 
project, objectives had to be clear, concise, and atta inable.  Objectives were designed to provide 
value, but attainable so as to increase the probability of success.  The customer was a key 
contributor to defining these objectives, whic h fostered a strategic focus.  Before Lunar 
Prospector started key leaders of the project got together to determine the project’s strategy and 
how this strategy would be focused on the proj ect objectives.  Then management made sure that 
this strategy was understood by t he project team by holding team  meetings at the beginning of 
the project to articulate this strategy. Once the project started, they c ontinued to articulate the 
strategic focus. 
 The spirit of Lunar Prospector was high, with fo cused and driven sprit.  There were not a lot of 
spirited rituals and activities, but more uns poken, common commitment that was understood by 
all team members.  People went the extra mile  and had faith that their team members would do 
the same.  People’s commitment to the projec t was never questioned, and there was always a 
willingness to try a different way of doing business.  Lunar Prospector was unique in how it was 
selected, managed, and developed, and this nutri tioned a strong sense of what was mission 
success. 
 
Lunar Prospector 32As an organization, Lunar Prospector was co-located.   This meant that meetings could occur 
face-to-face with no part of the core team mo re than ten minutes away.  This allowed Lunar 
Prospector to stay focused and directed while also having limited top management involvement, 
and being allowed to do things differently to get  around certain bureaucratic obstacles.  While top 
management allowed Lunar Prospector to be independent, it maintained a strong commitment to 
its success with a consistent  funding stream from top management, which did not waiver 
throughout the project. Team members and managem ent knew their roles and responsibilities 
from the beginning and no one ever questioned this. The team was maintained at a core 
minimum, if you were not needed,  you did not work on the project.  To accomplish this people 
worked the project from beginning to end.  If their services were not needed at any point in time, 
they were not released but deferred to another project until they were needed.  This allowed 
people to shepard systems through the project lifec ycle.  Having good shepards meant their were 
experienced people at the top combined with energet ic young engineers.  The focus of all of the 
managers was on making Lunar Prospector successf ul.  When problems arose, the management 
set aside differences to keep the project dire cted with a common goal of doing it appropriately 
and timely.  
 
Lunar Prospector had a good understanding of their technical capabilities, requirements, and 
constraints; therefore, they stuck to the requirements and knew when to freeze designs to 
maintain schedule.  To support this, Lunar Prospec tor performed an extensive amount of testing.  
It was not how much Lunar Prospector tested, but t he quality of their testing.  This meant test 
every piece of equipment in every possible scenario.  Lunar Prospector’s understanding of the 
systems and instruments could only be accomplished with  an intimate linkage to their contractors.  
Contractors were as much a part of Lunar Pros pector as any person working on the project day-
to-day.  Lunar Prospector’s relationship with it s contractors was candid, informal, and frequent. 
 
Lunar Prospector did not put a lot of weight in thei r formal reviews, but held their informal (peer) 
reviews as critical to achieving success.  Great  effort went into making sure the people on these 
committees were capable experienced individuals that would challenge Lunar Prospector while 
fully understanding their constraints.  
 
Recommendations 
Lunar Prospector was unique in that it was one of the few NASA sponsored missions that was 
truly PI led.  NASA has since moved away from a llowing the PI to be the lead for all aspects of a 
project.  This environment worked for Lunar  Prospector because it was small and had an 
experienced and directed PI.  Unfortunately this PI also brought an immense amount of tacit 
knowledge, thus it was difficult to document and transfer the project success to other projects. 
 
Recommendation 1 – Fully document the processes, even the process for success :  At the 
time of Lunar Prospector, the Discovery Progr am and Better, Faster, Cheaper were in their 
infancy.  Documenting the how and why shoul d have been more important to determining Lunar 
Prospector’s success.  Lunar Prospector was a focused project whose success, while measurable, was not captured.  Lunar Prospector was the vision of one man, Alan Binder.  Binder 
was focused, directed and driven to make Lunar Prospector successful.  While these may be 
some of the traits of a good leader and what was needed to make Lunar Prospector successful, the style and processes that Binder used to hel p Lunar Prospector be successful were not well 
documented.  Binder believed that to make Lunar Prospector successful, documentation had to 
be limited. While this streamlined processes, it left Lunar Prospector as a project that relied on 
the people as the keepers of the knowledge.  This knowledge and lessons learned was never 
captured and documented during or post- project.   
 
Lunar Prospector 33Recommendation 2 – Resolve leadership conflicts quickly and have clear lines of 
leadership:   Lunar Prospector was not without conf lict, and conflicts between managers were not 
uncommon.  Another issue with the leadership was the lack of training.  All of the managers were 
accomplished engineers/scientists, but almost all of them had little managerial training.  This may 
have been the source of some of their conf licts (other than pers onality differences).

CONTOUR 1Executive Summary 
As the sixth mission in NASA’s successful Discovery Program, the Comet Nucleus Tour 
(CONTOUR) was a joint project between Corne ll University and Johns Hopkins University 
Applied Physics Laboratory (APL), along with 14 other university, government, and industry co-
investigators to study three major near-Ear th comets. With a budget of $159 million and a 
development time of almost three years, it was scheduled to fly within 60 miles of each of three 
comets.  From the time of 2003-2008, CONTOUR would take images, make spectral maps and 
analyze dust flowing from the comets to s ubstantially improve the knowledge base and expand 
the understanding of comets.   
 As a breakthrough product, CONTOUR was a singl e spacecraft, and six scientific instruments 
designed to provide a detailed look at come ts and answer questions about how comets act and 
evolve.  While much of the technology wa s know, its application and what CONTOUR was 
planned to accomplish made it different than any thing that had been done before.  No one in the 
history of space exploration had ever brought a spacecraft as close to a comet as CONTOUR 
would.  While they were using predominantly existing, off-the-shelf technology and technology 
from previous missions (NEAR and Stardust), CONT OUR was flying for the very first time a non-
coherent DOPPLER navigation system and a Solid Rocket Motor (SRM) that had not been 
thoroughly tested with the spacecraft. 
 
As a project, CONTOUR was to design, test, and develop an orbiter that would obtain scientific 
data on comets and demonstrate the philosophy of ‘faster, better, cheaper.’  CONTOUR could be 
described as a high-tech project.  While much of the technology was proven from previous 
spacecraft, its application and what CONTOUR wa s planned to accomplish made it different than 
anything that had been done before.  The complexi ty of the project could be described as a 
system with a collection of in teractive elements and subsystems that has to perform a wide range 
of functions under extreme conditions.  The pace of the project was a blitz-critical project.  While 
many of the characteristics point to a fast-competitive project, it is the inflexible launch date of 
CONTOUR that moved it into a b litz-critical mode.  Any error in time or budget meant cancellation 
for the project.    
All of this would add up to what Cornell and APL  believed would be a storied success, but what 
happened on August 15, 2002 when communications were lost was never to be expected.  On 
August 15, CONTOUR was scheduled to accelerate the spacecraft and place it on a trajectory 
toward its first comet.  While operations cont inued based on the assumption that the firing took 
place on schedule, no signal was received from the spacecraft.  From August 16 through August 
21, three objects were identified near the ex pected position of CONTOUR.  Communications 
attempts continued with the spacecraft once a week through December 2002, and the mission 
was declared officially lost after the December communication attempts failed. 
 
Wide spread faults were hard to find in CONTO UR, and it embodied many of  the characteristics 
of successful Discovery Program missions.  Managem ent brought to the project years of success, 
and a firm belief that they knew what it woul d take to make CONTOUR successful.  Without a 
good framework for determining the technologica l complexity and overconfidence from past 
success, CONTOUR was challenged with not hav ing a clear understanding of the technological 
uncertainty.  The challenges and pressures of BFC resulted in a need for clearer lines of 
leadership, co-locating key subsystems, having team members 100% on the project (cradle to 
grave), and independent in-depth, technical review s with active communication with experts 
outside of the reviews.

CONTOUR 7Background 
The concept of CONTOUR was conceived in 1972 at a space science conference where comet 
missions were one of the discussion topics.  It wa s at this conference that Dr. Robert Farquhar, 
CONTOUR Mission Manager, and Dr. Joseph Veverka, CONTOUR Principle Investigator, first met and conceived of CONTOUR.  From some of these early discussions, the idea of comet flyby 
missions had been debated and proposed many times,  but it was not until the Discovery 
Management Workshop, held at San Juan Capistrano Research Institute in April 1993, that comet 
missions would eventually find a place that they could be openly discussed, researched, 
formulated and have an avenue for to be proposed fo r implementation.  This would be through 
the birth of the Discovery Program.  The Discove ry Program was designed to competitively select 
and develop small, moderate risk spacecraft for a frac tion of the cost of ‘flagship’ missions.   
 
In late 1993, $100,000 was awarded to perform a paper study on a ‘CONTOUR-type’ concept of 
doing a comet flyby mission of multiple comets using Earth swing-bys (the steering wheel for 
going from comet to comet).  Soon after that study, there was an Announc ement of Opportunity 
(AO) going out from the Discovery Program.  At  this time, Farquhar and Veverka put together a 
CONTOUR proposal that looked very different from the CONTOUR that would eventually be 
selected.  It looked like a more traditional s pacecraft.  This CONTOUR was cubed shape with 
articulated solar arrays, and would not fly as cl ose to the comet nucleus as was planned in the 
design that flew.  This original Discovery Pr ogram proposal was not selected, and did not even 
make it past the first round of selections.  Between that AO and the next AO (AO-96-055-02), a 
complete revamp of how CONTOUR would work as a mission and how close it would fly by the 
nucleus was performed. The new CONTOUR got rid of the articulated arrays, went with body-
mounted panels, and moved away from the cube shape to a spacecraft with eight sidewalls.  One 
of the most significant changes, t hat later would became a critical design decision, was the use of 
Earth swing-bys which resulted in integrating t he solid rocket motors (SRM) with the spacecraft. 
 With a new design, like many missions before it, CONTOUR was going to build on exploratory 
results from earlier missions, but do it in a uni que and innovative way.  Mars Pathfinder and Lunar 
Prospector opened new windows into the study of the Moon and Mars, but both had missions that 
went before them that laid the groundwork.  Mars Pathfinder had Viking, Mariner, and Mars 
Global Surveyor, and Lunar Prospector had Gemi ni, Apollo, and Clementine, and CONTOUR had 
earlier flybys of Comet Halley, data from NASA’s Stardust and the European Space Agency’s 
Rosetta missions.  But, like Mars Pathfinder and Lunar Prospector, CONTOUR was unique, 
innovative, and going to push the forefront of our understanding of the universe.  Proposed by 
Cornell University as a principal investigator  (PI)-led mission, CONTO UR was selected as the 
sixth Discovery Program mission in August 1997.  As PI, Veverka quickly looked to the Johns 
Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) to lead the spacecraft development and act 
as the implementing organization.  APL had a stri ng of successes with the most recently noted 
being the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR).   The team was feeling confident with the 
simple complexity of CONTOUR that would make it another Discovery Program success and 
erase the negativity NASA was receiving from two Mars failures (Mars Polar Lander and Mars 
Climate Orbiter).   
Mission Description 
As part of NASA’s successful Discovery Program , CONTOUR was a joint project between Cornell 
University and APL, along with 14 other universit y, government, and industry co-investigators to 
study three major near-Earth comets. With a budget  of $159 million, it was scheduled to fly within 
60 miles of each of the three comets.  From the time of 2003-2008 CONTOUR would take 
images, make spectral maps and anal yze dust flowing from the come ts to substantially improve 
CONTOUR 8the knowledge base and expand the understanding of comets.  CONTOUR was scheduled to fly 
by Comet Encke, one of the most evolved comets that are still active, in November 2003, Comet 
Schwassmann-Wachmann-3 in 2006, and Comet d’Arrest in 2008. 
 CONTOUR was the second Discovery class mission for APL.  Receiving many accolades from 
the success of the Near Earth Asteroid Rendez vous (NEAR) mission, APL believed they could 
replicate that success in CONTOUR.  They belie ved that there were many similarities in 
CONTOUR and NEAR with respects to component s, construction, and qualification techniques, 
but they differed in building and operating a spac ecraft with much less money.  With less money 
and a comfort for the technological challenge, CONTOUR sought some ambitious scientific 
objectives.  CONTOUR mission objectives were: 
 
1) Image the illuminated part of the fly-by hemispher e of each nucleus at resolutions of up to 4 
meters/pixel (25 times better than GIOTTO) to reveal details of surface morphology and of 
the processes responsible for the evolution of comets; 
2) For each nucleus, determine its size, shape,  rotation state, albedo/color heterogeneity, and 
activity through global imaging (100-500 meters/pixel); 
3) Obtain detailed compositional measurements of the gas in the near-nucleus environment of 
each comet in the mass range of 1-150 atomic mass number for neutral and low-energy ion 
species; 
4) Obtain detailed compositional measurements of dust (volatile and refractory) in the near-
nucleus environment of each comet for positiv e and negative ions in the mass range of 1 to 
250 atomic mass number, and detect particles in the mass range of 10
-15 to 10-9 grams; 
5) Map the ice/rock surface com position of each nucleus surfac e through infrared spectroscopy; 
6) Map the distribution of key radicals (OH, C 2, CN) and dust in the coma through filter imaging; 
7) For each comet, assess the levels of out gassing (gas/dust production) through imaging and 
spectroscopy as well as through in situ measurements of gas and dust in the coma; 
8) Assess the diversity of the target comets; 
9) If feasible, investigate a “new” comet to a ssess the difference between Kuiper Belt and Oort 
Cloud comets. 
 
As a six-year mission, CONTOUR was scheduled to  fly by two comets (with an optional third 
flyby) while taking images, making spectral maps, and analyzing dust and gas.  APL would use 
several innovative techniques for performing a low cost mission, such as indirect launch 
strategies, unattended hibernation and an innovativ e mission and spacecraft design.  CONTOUR 
launched on a Boeing Delta 7425-9.5 Medium Expendable Launch Vehicle.  The CONTOUR 
mission was to investigate comet nuclei and assess their similarity and diversity. During a four-
year period, CONTOUR would fly within 100 kilometers of two comet nuclei: Encke in 2003 and Schwassmann-Wachmann-3 (SW3) in 2006 with the ability to fly by d'Arrest in 2008. 
 
All of this would add up to what Cornell and APL believed would be a storied success, but 
CONTOUR never got that opportunity.  W hat happened on August 15, 2002 at 4:49 a.m. EDT 
when communications were lost was never to  be expected.  On August 15, CONTOUR was 
scheduled to initiate a 50-second SRM burn to accelerate the spacecraft and place it on a 
heliocentric trajectory toward Encke.  While operations continued based on the assumption that 
the firing took place on schedule, at 5:35 a.m. EDT no signal was received from the spacecraft.  
From August 16 through August 21, three objects were  identified from the University of Arizona’s 
Lunar and Planetary Laboratory Spacewatch Project near the expected position of CONTOUR.  
This led investigators to believe that the firing t ook place and that these objects were parts of the 
spacecraft and rocket engine.  NASA’s conclusions  were confirmed by images taken by the 
Department of Defense.  Communications attemp ts continued with the spacecraft once a week 
through December 2002, and the mission was declar ed officially lost after the December 
CONTOUR 9communications attempts failed.  Table 1 depict s the projects timeline from inception to 
completion.

 On August 22, 2002 NASA established a Type A Mishap Investigation Board (MIB) to review the 
circumstances and potential lessons learned from CONTOUR.  The Board was able to formulate 
a number of causes, but was unable to determine wi th certainty the proximate cause due to the 
lack of data during the SRM firing.  The Board ca tegorized these causes in to proximate causes, 
alternate proximate causes, possible causes, possi ble root cause, and significant observations.

Technology Description 
CONTOUR was designed as a flexible, low-cost mi ssion with four scientif ic instruments that 
would be used during each cometary nuclei enc ounter.  At each encounter, CONTOUR would 
record images, spectral maps and measur e dust and gas around the nucleus. The four-
instrument payload consisted of the CONTOUR Neutral Ga s and Ion Mass Spectrometer 
(NGIMS), Contour Remote Imager/Spectrograph (CRISP), CONTOUR Forward Imager (CFI), 
and CONTOUR Dust Analyzer (CIDA). The data that  these instruments collected would allow for 
a significant assessment of the diversit y of the nuclei of short-period comets. 
 
The NGIMS was designed to measure the abundance and isotope ratios for many neutral and ion species in the coma of each comet during the fl yby. These measurements together with data from 
the dust experiment would contribute to the under standing of the chemical  composition of the 
nucleus itself and allow differences between the comets to be studied.  The NGIMS instrument 
was developed by NASA/GSFC based on technology  from the Cassini mission. The CRISP 
would actively track the comet's nucleus near CONTOUR's closest approach, taking high-
resolution images, color images through 10 filters,  and an infrared spectral map.  The CFI was 
designed for high sensitivity and responsiveness to ul traviolet wavelengths. CFI would perform its 
measurements while CONTOUR was approachi ng the nucleus and at a range of >2000

2 The NPG 8621.1, NASA Procedures and Guidelines for Mi shap Reporting, Investigating, and

before the undesired outcome, directly caused its occurrence and, if elim inated, or modified, would have 
prevented the undesir able outcome.” 
3 The NPG 8621.1, NASA Procedures and Guidelines for Mi shap Reporting, Investigating, and

4 The NPG 8621.1, NASA Procedures and Guidelines for Mi shap Reporting, Investigating, and 
Recordkeeping  defines significant observation as: “A factor , event, or circumstanc e identified during the 
investigation that did not contribute to the mishap or close call, but  if left uncorrected has the potential to 
cause a mishap, injury, or increase the severity should a mishap occur.”  
CONTOUR 11kilometers. Its main functions were to locate the target comet against the star background days to 
weeks before an encounter, take color images of the nucleus, any gas or dust jets, and other 
features in the inner coma, and image the inner co ma in wavelengths sensitive to major species 
of ionized gas.  CRISP and CFI were developed by APL based on technology from the Near 
Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR) program. T he CIDA instrument wa s fabricated by von 
Hoerner & Sulger and rebuilt based of the instrument developed and flown on the Stardust 
spacecraft. The CIDA instrument was to m easure more than 1000 positive ion and 200 negative 
ion mass spectra from 1 to 250 atomic mass units, and detect particles from 10-15 to 10-9 grams.  
The CIDA instrument was fabric ated by von Hoerner & Sulger and rebuilt based of the instrument 
developed and flown on the Stardust spacecraft.  
The CONTOUR spacecraft was to provide the a ttitude control, propulsion, dust protection, 
thermal control, telecommunications, command and data handling and power.  Figure 1 shows a 
drawing of the spacecraft.  The design of CONTOUR was kept as simple as possible.  The 
CONTOUR solar array was body mounted, and t he mission geometry allowed CONTOUR to use 
fixed, passive, existing antenna designs.  With the exception of the long-tracking mirror for 
CRISP, moving the spacecraft controlled all inst rument and antenna pointing.  A dust shield made 
of Nextel and Kevlar protected against impacts . The spacecraft had two main operating modes: 
hibernation and encounter.  In hibernation mode, the spacecraft spun about its main axis at a rate 
of about 20 revolutions per minute.  During encount er mode, the spacecraft was 3-axis stabilized, 
and was planned to be fixed with the dust shields and instruments aligned to the comet.  Innovative to CONTOUR was the launch st rategy, unattended hibernation capability, and an 
innovative mission design and spacecraft design.

Strategy  
 
Objectives 
 
CONTOUR was submitted as a proposal in t he first Discovery Program Announcement of 
Opportunity (AO), and was rejected because of it s ambitious objectives and large budget.   When 
the proposal team sat down to determine the wi nning strategy for the next Discovery Program 
AO, they specifically cut back the objects and minimized the budget.  Objectives for CONTOUR 
were defined early in the proposal phase, writt en to address scientific inquiry, and then stuck to. 
In defining objectives for the CONTOUR mission Veverka viewed it as having two aspects to 
being successfully.  The first part is to identify important scientific questions that remain to be 
addressed.  For CONTOUR, this was the chemical diversity of comets, the actual detail isotopic 
chemical composition, and the actual working proc esses of comets.  The second part is to identify 
ways of achieving those within the cost guidelines  of a Discovery mission.  For CONTOUR, with a 
budget of around $150 million, critics questioned if there was a way of answering or addressing 
these interesting questions within a tight budget.  That meant both finding interesting scientific 
issues that could be addressed and the means of  addressing them in an economical fashion. 
 
Competitive Advantage/Value 
 
“The overall value is that you ar e doing the mission that you sold.” 
- Ed Reynolds, personal interview 
 
It is difficult for a government project to def ine a competitive advantage.   Usually they are 
supported by a congressional or administrative pus h.  In some cases they are developed from a 
scientific community pull.  In either case ther e is usually little competition, but CONTOUR was 
subjected to stringent competition to be selected in the Discovery Program.  The competition was 
in the initial proposal phase.  As Ed Reynolds, Mission Systems Engineer, st ated, “You sold it not 
really on one single competitive advantage, but you sold it on “Wa s it category one science?’ In 
the end that is a hard question to answer.”  The number one competitive advantage in any 
Discovery Program project is the science.  The selection panel is primarily scientist and they are 
asking the question, ‘Is this mission answering one of  the high priority f undamental questions that 
we have about science or the solar system.’   Rey nolds describes, “That if you are not what they 
term category one science, meaning that you are answering a very compelling question about 
what is out there.  You do not get to go to step two.”  Once a project is selected for the second 
phase of proposal review, then the competitive advantage moves from the science to the mission 
design.  For CONTOUR they believed this wa s being able to do three comet encounters with a 
single spacecraft and being able to launch on a small launch vehicle versus a big launch vehicle.  
Not only did CONTOUR feel competition from ot her proposals submitted under the same AO, but 
the previous AO saw a similar project ca lled Stardust funded and the European Space Agency 
was developing their own comet flyby mission, Rosetta.   
 CONTOUR believed that their co mpetitive advantage was that t hey had a unique mission design.  
Central to the success of the project and its desi gn was the use of Earth swing-bys to gain delta 
velocity (and thus reducing mission costs) and propel the spacecraft to its next target.  This was a 
theory that had only recently been tested but more  missions were beginning to use the method.  
Farquhar was beginning to look at Earth swing-bys mo re as a “steering wheel” to go from place to 
place.  It was a unique concept at the point CONT OUR was selected, but they believe it was one 
CONTOUR 13of the key factors that set CONTOUR apart from other missions, and more specifically multiple 
flyby missions.  Farquhar believed that he could st ring out five or six comets encounters in the 
trajectories, and it was only a matter of timing and trajectory.  There were many past proposals 
that designed for single flybys, but CONTOUR woul d put together multiple comets with a single 
spacecraft.  A second competitive advantage was that CONTOUR was using a phasing orbit.  
This would mean that instead of having the launch vehicle launching at the comet-facing 
trajectory and having the launch vehicle doing all t he work, it would be phased correctly in orbit.  
The spacecraft would launch, phase correctly and t hen fire the solid rocket motors at a precise 
time of perigee.  This would avoid the use of a larger, more expensive launch vehicle.  
CONTOUR estimates they saved between $10 and 20 million using this method.  APL believed 
another advantage was that they had had a history of successful projects with short periods of 
development, ideal for a Discovery Program mission.  
 
Once the project started the co mpetitive advantage transitioned into  value.  CONTOUR’s crucial 
value would be to the scientific community.  CONT OUR would ultimately deliver to the scientific 
community new and intriguing data on comets.  CONTOUR would bring a new hope and 
enthusiasm to everyone that believed in space exploration.  NASA was just coming off its 
investigations of the Mars 98 failures, which la ter resulted in CONTOUR becoming the last of the 
space science missions defined as ‘better, fast er, cheaper.’  A successful mission would have 
shown Congress that BFC was still a viable management alternative to doing quality space 
science with reduced budgets, and build the Congressional support NASA needed for a struggling agency.  
 
Business Perspective (Success Dimensions) 
 
CONTOUR believed that their success should be judged based on what they specified in their 
project plan; therefore, they believed in staying strict to  NASA’s procedures and guidelines 
document on project management (NPG  7120.5B).  They laid out t he schedule, cost profile, risks, 
and risk management into the project plan; c onsistent with NPG 7120.5B.  The schedule had 
enough detail in it that through the range of re views, and status meetings, management could 
reconcile what they were doing as stated in that plan with what was happening in reality.  
Discrepancies could then be reported during a re view, to the Space Department Management, 
and to the Discovery Program management office. 
 
While focusing on the project plan, CONTOUR m anagement also brought what they believed was 
a clear understanding of what would make CONT OUR successful.  Veverka was known for his 
pictorial focus on the objectives and what it w ould mean to be successful with CONTOUR.  Ed 
Reynolds tells the story of how  Veverka would accomplish this: 
 
Joe would always put up a cover of a book about the Haley flyby, and he would 
say, ‘This is the best picture that they  got from Haley.  There are lots of 
unknowns in this picture.  This pict ure seems to ask more questions than it 
answers.  The goal of CONTOUR is to get images that are at least 25 times 
better than this.’ That kind of really made it clear as to why were doing it. 
 
As with all Discovery Program missions, the primar y success factor is the achievement of project 
objectives, and project objectives are built on science requirements.  Because imaging of the 
comets was so important to CONTOUR, the most  significant success criteria was to get images 
of the nucleus of at least one comet nucleus bette r than 50 meters per pixel.  Second was to have 
a data set from either the gas analyzer or the dust analyzer.  To guarantee success, CONTOUR 
built into the scientific instruments internal cro ssover functions, so they would have resiliency in 
the success criteria.  They understood their capabilit ies and took advantage of that to give them 
enough elbowroom to achieve the mission success criteria. 
CONTOUR 14 
Strategic Focus 
 
“There is first of all the plan and then what actually happened.” 
- Dr. Joseph Veverka, personal interview 
 
CONTOUR believed in setting the strategic focus early , articulate it to the team and then consider 
it a ‘done deal.’  Reynolds believed that you hav e to have an awareness of what your customer 
wants or needs, and then enunciating those desires in  the early phase of the project (proposal 
development phase).  CONTOUR believed in the cu stomer and what they wanted in a mission; 
therefore, the project was designed and focused to  meet their needs based on their capabilities.  
For NASA this meant safety, cost, and implementat ion.  For the science community, this meant 
quality data.  Once the strategic focus was set, management laid it out as this is the mission 
design, this is the launch vehicle, and this is  the approach that we think is going to win. 
 Mary Chiu, Project Manager, believed that to k eep the team focused on the strategy she had to 
communicate it both orally and wr itten, and reiterated it several times throughout the project.  She 
felt as Project Manager it was her  responsibility to make sure people stayed focus.  Chiu stated:  
 
We wrote up several things about what we were going to do as far as the low 
cost nature, use technology that wa s existing, use good system engineering, 
incorporate things that were off-the-s helf if we could, and that was made very, 
very clear to the leads and all of the developers as we were proposing and 
developing. 
 
More specifically, CONTOUR management identif ied specific events and actions that they 
believed allowed CONTOUR to maintain a strategic focus toward success:  
 Good Systems Engineering:   CONTOUR believed they  had very good, experience 
leads in the various disciplines that were able to think out-side the box while grounded in 
the projects reality. 
 Frequent, Active Communication:   Frequent meetings with all of the key leads, and 
keeping everything balanced and making sure that people were held to that line. 
 Develop Requirements Up Front:   CONTOUR stressed to all of their leads that 
requirements should be developed early, froze early and followed. 
 Everyone was a Contributor:   CONTOUR believed everyone on the team was an 
engaged participant in the project success. 
  
 
 
CONTOUR 15Project Spirit and Leadership  
 
Organizational Culture 
 
The one word used the most to described the cult ure of CONTOUR was “family.”  As a family 
they experienced their shared differences and succe sses.  As in the case of CONTOUR where 
there was a significant failure, it was described as  loosing a member of the family.  People were 
very close to each other and the project with a great sense of camaraderie.  Veverka believed 
that at another level this meant that you coul d ask people to do tremendous things without feeling 
guilt because people were excited about the cha llenge.  There was a very close kinship on 
CONTOUR. 
 
Veverka stated, “I think the answer to having su ccess with any kind of Discovery mission is that 
you need to have a partnership where the cultures are similar or the cultures are compatible.”  He 
believed that this was the case with APL and Cor nell with cultures that were very similar and 
compatible in that both places were involved in doing very complicated things with a small 
number of very talented, very dedicated peopl e.  He believed these smaller, directed 
organizations eliminated the negativities of lar ge organization where “half the people only collect 
paychecks.”  The people of CONTOUR were dedicat ed to a successful mission.  With a small 
manageable organization, Veverka believed that “you can do very complicated things.”  Part of 
this was having very few “really exceptional, abs olutely unique” individuals that he believed were 
irreplaceable, and use of their talents to  try and do something “really special.”  
 
At APL, management saw a similar culture develop fo r CONTOUR as they did with NEAR.  With 
a short schedule based on a planetary launch window, the culture was “exactly the same,” as 
Reynolds said.  Reynolds stated that he has worked on missions that have taken five and six 
years to develop, and he believes the culture and spirit  were a lot worse.  He believes that for the 
missions with long development times, people ar e accused of having too much time, sitting 
around, ‘shooting the breeze.’  The culture t hat develops around a mission under a tight budget 
and schedule is more appealing to most people and keeps every team member engaged and excited.   
 
Project Spirit 
 
“I got a lot of positive feedba ck that there was a lot of pride and enjoyment working on 
CONTOUR.” 
 - Mary Chiu, personal interview 
 Management believed that motivation and good spirit did not need to be fostered.  They believed 
the people involved thought CONTOUR was a tremendous and challenging effort and this 
motivated the people. A lot of the elements t hat CONTOUR was trying to accomplish involved 
new, complicated tasks that people were genuinely in terested in doing.  Management stated that 
they were not aware of any time that they needed to motivate people or worry about project 
moral.    
Although, many of the tensions and linkages associated with a ‘better, faster, cheaper’ project 
were present in CONTOUR, mainly budget  and schedule.  CONTOUR had enormous cost 
constraints, most notably after the Phase A/B st udy.  This became a reality check for CONTOUR 
that it was going to cost quite a bit more than w hat was originally proposed.  Budgetary issues in 
any NASA project can quickly lead to termination, so  there was lot of pressure on everyone to get 
their costs down which did not have a positive impact on the team.  Chiu described it as: 
 
CONTOUR 16One of the things that I insisted on, Ed  was certainly part of this, was making 
sure that things were communicated.  We  were upfront with everyone as to what 
the facts were, what was going on with the NASA people, what was going on with 
our own management.  Trying to keep people informed as to what was going on, rather than saying ‘No, re-cost, re-cost… cu t this, cut that.’  There was lot of back 
and forth.  A lot of sole searching as far as what was really needed in certain 
areas.  What we could do with less money.  What we couldn’t do.  Where was the line you were compromising the abilit y to get the job done if you went less 
than such, and such cost.  I think during that time, people were not too happy.  I 
know I wasn’t.  I think at that stage there were probably some low points.   
 
Along with a tight budge, it was a tight schedule,  and everyone knew it was a tight schedule.  
There was no relief of the schedule, and the launch window had to be met or the project would be 
canceled.  The team worked very hard to prevent the project from turning over in its schedule to 
the point that it had to make up time.  The imm ediate team at APL was a small team that worked 
single shifts with normal working hours.  The pre ssures of meeting a strict  schedule were kept to 
normal working hours, except prior to launc h when some engineers worked four weeks day and 
night to get things done, but without question.   Other than that, only once did the team have to 
work a Saturday to maintain the schedule.  Management insisted on not asking team members to 
double up on hours, work weekends, or overtime.  They held strong to that philosophy, even at 
the launch site, when time was the most critical.  
Chiu believed in the team spirit and would even find fund sources outside of the project to try and 
foster the team spirit.   She would go after money that was not tied to the project to get things like 
pens and decals.  She would also find non-proj ect fund sources for in-house and out-of-house 
picnics, and team building exercise s.  Another activity of Chiu was weekly write-up that would be 
posted on the external web site.  It was about hal f a page of text with a photograph.  She termed 
it ‘Picture of the Week.’  She made sure that th is activity had a lot of involvement with the team 
members to express the type of work they were doing, why it was important to the program, and a 
picture of them doing it.  She believed it wa s a way to make sure that people’s work was 
recognized and highlighted.  One manager gave an exam ple of a classic ‘Picture of the Week.’  
He describes: 
 
One time in one of our status meetings  we were putting people together for the 
white room, so you need to know how to dress for the white room.  The guy who was doing contamination control was showi ng us the outfits, but he really was not 
putting them on.  People were saying, ‘Oh, it is going to take us 10 minutes to put 
all of that on,’ and he would say, ‘No, y ou can get it on in 30 seconds.’  So we 
said, ‘Okay, go.’  It caught him by surprise and he was scrambling to put all of 
this garb on, and I think he got it down to 50 seconds.  Right there at the end we 
had a digital camera there, and we snapped it.  That ended up on one of the pictures of the week.  So there was a recognition point of view to it, and there 
was a kind of silliness point of view. 
 
Policy to Support Strategy and Spirit 
 
“We basically tried to reach a balance betw een enough structure to do things well, also enough 
flexibility to allow individuals the opportuni ty to do the things they needed to do.” 
 - Dr. Joseph Veverka, personal interview 
 As an organization, APL has a lot of guidelines that  are used, but they are viewed in many cases 
as options.  For CONTOUR, management tried to reach a balance with the level of procedures 
that were needed to make sure that things were done properly and without undue risk.  This 
CONTOUR 17meant sometimes relaxing procedures to allow people the maximum flexibility to do things the 
way they really thought they needed to be done.   CONTOUR management did not believe in 
micro-management of individuals.  People had clearly assigned tasks, and there was great 
confidence in people that they could carry out t hose tasks.  CONTOUR believed by lifting some of 
the procedural requirements, it gave people an empowered feeling and lifted the spirit.   
 
Leadership 
 
CONTOUR management worked to be fair and honest across the team while maintaining a 
professional but friendly relationship with team  members.  The management team was not hands-
on managers, but rather worked for an inform ed, non-intrusive style. CONTOUR management 
believed that engineers should be allowed to perfo rm their job without the restriction of 
managerial interference and believed their efforts should be focused toward maintaining the 
project strategy, structure, and lines of communication.   As Project Manager, Mary Chiu was 
considered by most as the central leader for t he project, with a “firm” management style. One 
manager described here as: 
 
We have projects here that people say, ‘You know, instead of a linear polarized 
array, we can give you a circular polarized array that is only 10 million more 
dollars.’  We have people that just say, ‘Oka y, do it.’  Mary was firm in that people 
would come and say, ‘Here is something that  we can do that is different from the 
baseline,’ and she would basically say, ‘No!’ 
 
CONTOUR was basically the same spacecraft by design and budget at the time of launch as was 
proposed in 1997.  From 1997 to the time of launch (July 2002) many factors weighed heavy on 
CONTOUR (e.g. the Mars 98 failures and 9/11), but  many attribute Chiu’s polite firmness and 
focused management approach to bringing this pr oject in on time and on budget.  This brought 
her respect from her team and set the tone for how CONTOUR would operate.  Down through the 
organization, CONTOUR management relied heav ily on their lead engineers to provide 
leadership.  They were held accountable for keeping the communication lines open, and 
delegating decision making down through the organization. 
 
Team Empowerment 
 
“My concern as a PI wasn’t to make sure t hat somebody was putting in the right number of 
screws.” 
- Dr. Joseph Veverka, personal interview 
 Management held a great deal of trust in team mem bers to perform their job and believed trust to 
be an important element to how CONTOUR func tioned.  Management assumed that certain tasks 
were happening and believed in dealing with things at a higher level.  CONTOUR tried to let the decisions be made at the engineering level.  If decision that rippled back up to management 
conflicted, management was very quick to try and recognize this and call a meeting with the 
affected people to work out a compromise.  The group decision was then rippled back down through the organization.  Chiu stated, “I th ink that having people empowered to make those 
decisions and run with them until they ran up agai nst someone else was a big factor in people’s 
satisfaction and pride in the work.”  The way that CONTOUR was managed was not unique to 
CONTOUR but standard operating procedure at APL .  For each project there is a Project 
Manager.  Underneath the Project Manager are t he Lead System Engineers, and then for all the 
different subsystems there is  a Lead Subsystems Engineer.  At the beginning of the project 
meetings are held to determine the budgets and schedul es.  Then there is an “unwritten contract” 
with the Project Manager and the Lead System and Subsystem Engineers for a commitment to 
this budget and schedule.  The Lead Subsystem Engi neer is then given the authority to work on 
CONTOUR 18the designs, the implementation, and how things get  done within their subsystem as long as they 
are meeting the criteria establish at these in itial meetings.  CONTOUR believed they empowered 
at the lead level.  For example, the lead mechanical engineer is empowered to procure, 
assemble, and test as long as they abide by thei r milestones and deliverables, and stay within the 
agreed upon budgets.  CONTOUR believed this form  of empowerment gr eatly contributed the 
team spirit. 
  
CONTOUR 19Organization  
 
Project Organization 
 
The CONTOUR Principal Investigator was Dr. Joseph Veverka, Cornell University, who was 
responsible for the project and accountable to the Associate Administrator (AA) for Space 
Science for scientific success and the Discove ry Program Manager (DPM) for programmatic 
success.  Johns Hopkins University/Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) was responsible for 
implementing the project, and Mary C. Chiu  was the project manager. The APL Space 
Department Management Advisory Committee (S DMAC) in addition to management personnel 
from Cornell University was the governing Pr ogram Management Council (PMC) for CONTOUR.   
The APL Space Department Head, Dr. Stamatios M.  Krimigis, chaired this council. The DPM was 
an ad hoc member of these review boards.  The APL  Director was responsible for certifying the 
CONTOUR mission readiness to the AA for Spac e Science, through the Discovery Program 
Office.  The PI directly managed the activities of the science team members, the Science Data 
Center (SDC) at Cornell and the Education and Public Outreach (E/PO) activities. The PI 
delegated the remaining project elements to the project manager at APL.  The project manager 
was responsible for maintaining the project schedule, budget and mission capabilities across all team organizations in accordance with the projec t plan.  The project manager also coordinated, 
via the Discovery Program Office (DPO) and wi th PI approval, the NASA facility support for 
CONTOUR.  
The CONTOUR team included partners from three academic institutions, three NASA centers, 
one federal research laboratory and one company.  The maximum number of people working on the mission was around 200.  At APL, which wa s the bulk of the effort, ranged between 60 and 
100 at the maximum and maintained a steady state between 20 and 40.  The science team 
consisted of about 20 individuals at  institutions around the country and one institution in Europe.  
Each of those institutions would on the average have four peopl e working with them.  This 
constituted about 100 people involved in the science; 20 of them directly as  co-investigators, 60-
70 as associates, and the rest as graduate students and technical associates.  Table 2 indicates 
these partners and their role in CONTOUR.

Structure 
 
The majority of the project team and effort was lo cated at APL.  At APL the project was kept small 
and co-located with most of the team located in  two buildings.  While the team at APL was 
predominantly co-located, many of  the people came from matrix organizations and thus kept ties 
to their functional organization for the duration of  the project.  Because of co-location at APL, 
most communication was performed face-to-fa ce, and the telephone was rarely picked up.  
Reynolds described it as: 
 
The answer you needed was right down the ha ll.  You would go down and get it.  
A lot of times there are things that get re solved in hallways all the time.  If you are 
all together, you are aware of other people’s i ssues almost as fast as they are.  
So there was a lot of synergy by just pulling people together in one tight location. 
 
While co-location was true for APL, it was not true for the entire project team.  The Cornell team, 
which led one of the most significant development s of the project, the science experiments, was 
not co-located with the APL team.  In addition, t he contractor for the Solid Rocket Motor was not 
co-located with the spacecraft development at  APL and the linkage between these two groups 
was later identified by the MIB as a factor in the mission failure.  Ironically, co-location has not 
occurred at APL since CONTOUR.

CONTOUR 21Team Assembly 
 
“How people are selected is an art form rather than anything I can put into words.”  - Mary Chiu, personal interview  
In the early part of the proposal phase of the pr oject, it started out with Farquar, Veverka, and 
Reynolds.  When they decided to re-submit CONT OUR in response to the second AO, Mary Chiu 
was approached by the APL Space Science Departm ent to be the proposal manager.  With the 
core proposal team selected, leads for the subsyste ms were identified to work on their respective 
sections of the proposal.  Despit e their selection to the team, mo st of these leads during project 
development were not the same as during the project development. 
 
Once CONTOUR was selected, Cornell and Veverka, as the responsible organization to NASA, 
were accountable for assembling a team for t he project. This included building and launching the 
spacecraft and performing the mission operations  once the spacecraft was launched.  He had 
already chosen to work with APL because of hi s previous connection with them on the NEAR 
mission.  Veverka believed you have to start at the top and find the best people to be project 
managers and mission directors, and then work your  way to the best scientist.  He stated: 
 
What you are really talking about is bu ilding four people.  So once you have done 
that the process basically replicates itself.  Then you let those people select 
whom they want to work with. I think by and large we really got the best people 
available at the time. 
 Once the process of team assemble was at APL , it relied primarily on the group supervisors to 
select team members.  APL functions primarily as a matrix organization, and thus what typically 
happens is a request is made to a group supervisor for a lead engineer, and it is the responsibility 
of the matrix organization to provide the best person. Each matrix organization has degrees of 
flexibility on how they allow personnel to be sele cted from their group. Some are more ridge than 
others.  Chiu said, “There is availability, then trying to piece together somewhat matching 
personalities.  What you have ava ilable is kind of your field and sometimes at APL there was only 
two people in the availability groupings.”  Chiu al so selected people from previous projects she 
had worked on, because she knew their personalities and talents well.  In some instance she held 
out for these people until they were av ailable.  Chiu says it is a co mbination of who is available, 
past history, how they fit in with the rest  of the team, and if the people had worked together 
before.   
 
Responsibilities 
 
CONTOUR stayed strict to thei r Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) that was product oriented.  
The spacecraft functions and the design were set during the proposal phase; therefore, 
CONTOUR did not deviate from its original plan and thus the WBS.   
Top Management Involvement 
 
As a project CONTOUR was responsible to t he Space Department Advisory Committee, NASA, 
and administrators at Cornell and APl.  The Space Department Committee was eight people 
consisting of the department head, the chie f engineer, a representative from science, 
engineering, and software and marketing.  This co mmittee operates in the same role as the 
center counsel specified in NASA’s NPG 7120. 5B document.  This group was given active 
updates on the status of the project every two m onths. The Project Manager performed this with a 
standard 30-minute oral presentation format.  Standard topics would include cost reserves, 
schedule reserves, mass margins, power margin, action item close-out, and waiver status. In 
CONTOUR 22general, top management at APL stayed at  arms length.  Chiu recalls that most of the time they 
made a conscious effort not to be involved.  Chiu  said, “At APL it is sometimes best to be under 
the radar, and not to be noticeable to top m anagement.”  It was not until CONTOUR encountered 
serious money problems at the end of the Phase A/B that they became significantly involved. 
 
Oversight from NASA headquarters and linkages to t he project came in the form of people being 
specified as project scientist or engineers on the project.  This opened them up to participating in 
regular meetings.  But, one manager stated that this  also caused some confusion.  There did not 
seem to be direct lines of communication to  the headquarters leads.  Sometimes the project 
scientist, at NASA headquarters, would be in contradi ction with the Discovery Program office 
manager.  Reynolds said, “It is kind of hard being the guy underneath looking at this 
contradiction, and wondering w ho you are working for.”  
 
In the planning stages of the project there were discussions and memorandums of understanding 
between administrators at APL and administrators at  Cornell to outline their relationship and the 
project.  But Veverka stated, “Nothing really happened with those things.”  What happened is that 
Veverka and Chiu relied on active communication for the important decisions.  At the 
administrative level there was very little invo lvement, accept when budgets were being discussed.  
Generally, Veverka and Chiu made 90% of the decis ions.  At the project management level Chiu 
was involved every day, and she had no other work responsibilities.   
 
Professional Advice and Reviews 
 
“We had more reviews than I think I had had on any other project.”  - Mary Chiu, personal interview 
 
At the beginning of the project several boards we re established, both external and internal.  
External reviews followed many of the standar d NASA reviews.  The APL Space Department 
(SD) Chief Engineer was responsible for a ssembling and chairing (or designate a chair) a 
committee of ten for this independent review board.  They were responsible for the Preliminary 
Design Review (PDR), Critical Design Review (CDR), Pre-Environmental Review (PER), Pre-
Ship Review (PSR), and Mission Readiness Review  (MRR).  Concerted effort was made to try 
and get members with diverse disciplines.  The committee would be about 60% APL personnel 
not on the project, and 40% people from other organi zations (not APL and not on the project).  
CONTOUR viewed reviewers as “little independent c ontractors.”  Typical members came from 
other federal agencies, aerospace corporati ons, and NASA/aerospace retirees.  CONTOUR 
would then subcontract them to be on review boar ds for their peer reviews.  Once they got 
someone they felt was a good reviewer, did all t hey could to keep that person on subcontract.  
Chiu said, “When you got someone who was a good reviewer, and of course we took down 
names and numbers to know who to call back and w ho not to call back, they were worth their 
weight in gold.”  Peer reviews were conduct ed at lower levels and assembled by the lead 
engineers and their technical organizations.  Re view board members were independent of the 
CONTOUR Project element under review.   
 
Organizational Problems 
 
“The reason why we got through them (our probl ems) was because we did have such a strong 
team; a lot of commitment within the team to each other.” 
 - Mary Chiu, personal interview 
 CONTOUR believed you address problems quickl y and with the affected people.  When a 
problem was identified, the people affected would get together and trying to come to some kind of 
resolution.  Because CONTOUR was a small enough organization, Chiu and Reynolds would 
CONTOUR 23spend time each day outside of regular meet ings walking around and making sure they 
understood what was going on; be able to address pr oblems real-time.  This strengthened their 
regular meetings by making sure that communica tion stayed fluid, so when there was something 
that did not sound right it could be addressed.  Chiu said that as the project went on they had 
more and more people just showing up at managem ent’s doors saying ‘Hey, something is not 
working out.’  Problem resolution meetings were usually kept to four to five people involved and 
on rare occasion may have involved up to ten.  Re solution meetings occurred in real-time and at 
most were delayed by only a day.  CONTOUR tried to make things very responsive by getting the 
people involved and making decision quickly.  If a dec ision from these meetings involved more 
people, an email was sent to a broader group of peopl e to make sure that they were aware of 
what was going on and what was being decided and discussed. 
 
The biggest organizational problem with CONTOUR was centered on an uncertainty in the 
technology.  CONTOUR was flying for the very first time a non-coherent DOPPLER navigation 
system.  Normally deep space mission fly c oherent transponders, but CONTOUR figured out a 
way to use regular receivers and transmitte rs and apply counters to the receivers and 
transmitters embedding counts into the data stream.  From the ground, the data would look just 
like a coherent transponder on the ground.  The difficu lty was that information had to be extracted 
out of the telemetry and applied to an algorithm before it could appear as a coherent transponder.  
The Deep Space Network team strongly disliked this  method.  The navigation team also did not 
like this method because it added a step to the process and they felt that it was very risky.  This 
issue caused a lot of discomfort between the teams and an increase in testing.  CONTOUR 
believed they overcame any uncertainty with a lot of testing.  Even with all the testing there was 
still a lot of uneasiness between the teams.  
Training 
 
Since CONTOUR was primarily a matrix organizati on, it relied on the functional organizations to 
ensure the continuing education of  their team members.  As a project, CONTOUR viewed the 
attendance at conferences as their form of training. 
 
CONTOUR 24Processes  
 Project Phases and Reviews 
 
The APL Space Department Management Advisory  Committee conducted programmatic reviews 
at APL of the implementation ever y six weeks.  Despite the ext ensive reviews, the MIB concluded 
the “candid, critical, and constructive peer and independent reviews, as well as similar systems 
engineering work, were impeded by this approach (APL’s processes and procedures), and that 
this situation enhanced the risk of pot ential design errors going undetected.”5  In addition to the 
APL designated review committee, the Discove ry Program brought in an Independent Advisory 
Team (IAT).  The IAT was comprised of non-N ASA people with diverse backgrounds.  At reviews, 
review team members would record actions or request for actions.  These would then be 
consolidated into a written and oral report listi ng the action items, findings and recommendations.  
Internally, all of the subsystems and the in struments had their own PDR, CDR, fabrication 
feasibility review, mission operation review, and conc ept of operation review.  In addition, all of 
the software had its own review process.  The MIB stated that these relevant reviews did 
measure up to the rigors and completeness of similar NASA reviews.  Table 2 shows the 
schedule project reviews.

CONTOUR 25Communications 
 
Each month CONTOUR would perform standard projec t reviews, which involved all of the leads, 
the principle investigator, and usually a N ASA person attended from Headquarters.  In these 
meetings, which lasted about three-quarters of a day, the leads presented t heir month’s progress, 
goals for next month and any problems.  Chiu us ed these meeting to help her prepare for her 
monthly progress report to top management.  CONTO UR also used these meetings as a time to 
get all of the leads in the same room and ma ke sure they knew what was happening in other 
areas.  Meetings were not just restricted to management and leads.  These meetings were 
purposely held in a large room so any one from the project could attend. 
 
In addition, CONTOUR held mid-month meetings that  were more of a technical meeting. The PI 
and a NASA representative did not attend these meet ings.  Chiu would also have a meeting once 
a month with the group supervisors and the l ead engineers to discuss budgetary issues.  Once 
the project moved into fabrication, CONTO UR had meetings with the fabrication group on a 
regular basis, but not on regular intervals. In  communication with top management, Chiu would 
hold monthly project status meetings with repor ts from all implementation elements and weekly, 
monthly and quarterly status reports to t he Discovery Program Management Office for 
implementation activities.   
 
While CONTOUR believed in face-to-face communi cation and co-location, this was the case at 
APL, and not the case between APL and the other organizations. This was relevant in the 
communication linkages between APL and the Cornell led science team that did not sit at APL, 
and thus did not participate in regular weekly meet ings or have the ability to have real-time face-
to-face communication with the implementing organization, APL.  To formulate the linkage 
between APL and Cornell, Veverka would hold week ly and as needed telecons with Chiu, travel 
to APL once a month, and every two months, other key individuals would make the trip to APL.  
The lack of communication was most prevalent in  APL and the SRM contractor.  The Contractor 
stated that they had historica lly dealt with customers that had more experience with SRM 
application and thus usually did not play an active role in spacecraft design.  While the MIB stated 
that the linkages and oversight of APL wi th the SRM subcontractor was not adequate. 
 
Resource Management 
 
“CONTOUR was a really great project, and if it hadn’t been for the budgetary restrictions, it would 
have been a dream project.”  
 - Mary Chiu, personal interview 
 CONTOUR decentralized the management of resour ces by distributing money and responsibility 
for that money to each organization.  While Veverk a, as PI, was in charge of approving the overall 
budgets, he let Chiu manage APL’s part and concer ned himself only with the science team at 
Cornell.  Once the money was di stributed, CONTOUR believed in stay ing strict to the WBS.  At 
the beginning of the project templates would be di stributed within the groups to lay out schedules, 
milestones, and resources (e.g. people, material , equipment, and subcontractor estimates).  
These templates would then evolve into contra cts.  It was the responsibility of every team 
member to live by these contra cts.  If they were having ten people working on the contract in 
March and eleven in April, they knew that the program manager saw that through the chart 
sheets.  As long as a manager or lead was within  their profile, management left them alone.  Chiu 
then relied on the weekly status  meetings with the lead engineers and the group supervisors to 
comment of any abuse of resources.     
The schedule and budget responsibility was ultimate ly the responsibility of the lead engineer.  
Chiu said that it depended on the lead engineer how active they were in those two areas.  
CONTOUR 26Schedule tracking and budgetary tracking, especially in  the “bureaucratic manor that a lot of the 
NASA people like is a lot of effort and can suck up a lot of time if done in certain ways,” Chiu said.  
Chiu balanced this by giving responsibility to t hose that wanted it and managing the responsibility 
of those that did not. Chiu believed the leads most  significant responsibility was for their technical 
expertise, not their budgetary and scheduling skills. 
 
As for the scheduling, Chiu believed that t he lead engineer had to be cognizant of the schedule 
and needed to know all the different elements that go into the schedule.  She stated that this was 
most important when coordinating with the f abrication facility.  She held the lead engineers 
accountable for knowing their schedule, but not fo r tracking their schedule on Microsoft Project©. 
Despite her persistence and some of  the leads starting off with gr eat enthusiasm for tracking their 
schedule, many tapered off after a while because t hey felt it was time consuming.  Chiu 
compensated for this with her own efforts by picking up where they were delinquent. 
 
In retrospect, Chiu says if she had to do it agai n, she would have had a much bigger staff at the 
project management office to do budget and scheduling.  She said there were other projects that 
had Schedulers, but because of the low cost nat ure and the budget restrict ions of CONTOUR, 
they had to rely more on their lead engineers.  
Reducing Uncertainty 
 “We were doing a big rocket mission on a little rocket.  In the end, that turned out to burn us, because we had the mishap right at the ve ry end of the solid rocket motor burn.” 
 - Ed Reynolds, personal interview  
In many NASA projects, great emphasis is  placed on budgetary reserves to address any 
unforeseen issues.  Chiu said that reserves were something that NASA wanted CONTOUR to do 
in the AO but when the budget ran thin, reserves were the first thing to go.  What reserves 
remained, were at the project level.  Therefore,  at the engineering level, reserves were replaced 
with an emphasis on off-the-shelf technology, testing, and internal system redundancy.  
CONTOUR believed they could dramatically reduce technical uncertainty by flying almost all of 
their spacecraft from commercial- off-the-shelf technology and a ri gorous testing program.  They 
did not believe CONTOUR was a new technology dev elopment program in any sense.  Mary Chiu 
stated: 
 
We were trying to do it with state of the art technology, but not out-there 
technology.  It was with known techniques.  There was not a lot of ‘We have to 
do research and develop new technologies type of thing.’  It was ‘What can we pull from off-the-shelf to meet the objectives.’ 
 
They would breadboard certain parts and put those par ts through a testing program to resolve the 
uncertainty as early as possible.  They tried to  understand what uncertainties they could tolerate 
without a bad outcome.  They were applying sensit ivity analysis to determine which things they 
should focus the highest priority, and put a lot of  resources there.  This was a standard approach 
for APL and routinely used as a method of r educing engineering documentation compensated by 
a “robust test program.”   
 Additionally, to overcome any technological uncertainty, they used built-in redundancy. An 
example of this was in the design of the power switching; the designer always slipped in a few 
more relays through the design review requirem ents for any unanticipated problems.  As Chiu 
stated, “Then when someone would say, ‘Oh my G od, I need a relay,’ he would come in as the 
savior.”  An engineer on CONTOUR also believed it  was their responsibility to try and break their 
own systems.  Chiu said: 
CONTOUR 27 
In many cases I became very frustrated and irritated by these three plus sigma 
things that people envisioned and why they were  taking all the time to test all of 
this, but I think that is what made the des igns so good.  Unfortunately, we did not 
get to prove our designs.  I think in the past we have had a fairly high success 
rate in the things that were developed at APL. 
 While these processes had shown success on previous Discovery missions and past APL 
missions, the inability to test the assembly of t he SRM with the spacecraft did not allow for the 
implementation of rigorous testing and the SRM ul timately became the primary failure point.  
Farquhar, Mission Manager and Designer, came up with  the scenario of using the gravitational 
pull of the Earth to achieve a very low energy way of reaching three comets, but to accomplish 
this the SRM had to be added to the main spac ecraft, complicating the simplicity of the 
spacecraft. 
 Systems Engineering 
 
CONTOUR believed that because they were us ing predominantly off-the-shelf or re-use 
technology (e.g. the gyros, the star trackers , the avionics were all based on designs that had 
flown previously), that system s integration and engineer were very  straight forward.  CONTOUR 
used what they termed as ‘traditional margins. ’  APL, at the beginning of a project, requires a 
project to start with at least 15% margins.  CONTOUR met this requirement even with actual 
mass measurements on 90% of the hardware.  CONTOUR bragged that they kept to their 
numbers and had very high confidence in these number s.  Because a lot of technology was re-
use, CONTOUR relied heavily on standard interfaces fo r systems integration.  They believed they 
were not doing anything unique.  As an example,  CONTOUR relied on plume heating analysis by 
non-APL personnel for a commercial spacecraft, later re vealing that there were distinct difference 
between CONTOUR and the commercial spacecraft CONTOUR was using for its design analysis.  
While designers attempted to overcome these di fferences by applying a 2x factor of safety, 
proper analysis was not performed on the des ign changes to reveal the discrepancies. 
 
The confidence in the inherited technology also resulted in CONTOUR waiting until late in the 
projects development phase to have a focused effort  on systems integration.  The MIB referred to 
this as “inheritance reviews,” and specified that these did not occur early enough in the project life 
cycle.  The efforts on integration did not becom e concentrated until each of the subsystems was 
almost finished. 
 
Risk Management 
 
When the Discovery Program was first envisioned as a program, the term ‘acceptable risk’ was 
used to describe projects with significant retu rn for a minimal cost.  The Discovery Program 
placed a tolerance on ‘acceptable risk’ as a project of $125 million (1992 dollars), and could 
tolerate a failure from time to time.  As  time passed, and Dan Goldin was appointed NASA 
Administer, ‘acceptable risk’ and the Discovery Program became defined by ‘better, faster, 
cheaper.’  After the Mars ’98 failures, the term  ‘acceptable risk’ disappeared from presentations 
and documents.  There was a tightening of what the Discovery Program was and how much risk 
could be tolerated.  Also during this time the NASA Investigative Action Team (NIAT) was formed to review the Mars ’98 failures and NASA proj ect management.  Before the NIAT had completed 
their investigation, CONTOUR wa s selected.  Therefore, CONTO UR was late in incorporating 
recommendations from the NIAT report to lower the overall risk of CONTOUR.  While the original 
vision for the Discovery Program was to perfect  ‘faster, better, cheaper’, to have focused, 
dedicated project teams, and no formal reviews, a fter the NIAT things got tighter and tighter.  It 
became a situation that Discovery Program projects  did everything the large projects did without 
CONTOUR 28exception, including full document ation, concepts, and parts.  Fr om what it was conceived and 
born as, it very quickly became a standard N ASA program, from approach to oversight.  
CONTOUR fell right in the middle of this identity crisis. 
 CONTOUR did do a standard preliminary risk analys is (PRA), and did perform other standard risk 
analysis before the project started (e.g. fault tree and event tree).  What CONTOUR did not do 
was combine all of the analysis into a formalized PRA.  They believed that  the risk analysis that 
was preformed gave them insight into where to  focus and where risk was acceptable.  One area 
that CONTOUR always felt was a high-risk, single point failure from multiple angles was the solid 
rocket motor.  What if the motor did not light?  What  if it lit and it went, and they were five minutes 
off, fifteen minutes off?  What if the motor blew  up?  All of these were single point failures.  
CONTOUR just did not role it up together into  a PRA, but believed they had enough insight into 
all of their analyses to figure out  where the sensitive points were. 
 
Customer Involvement 
 
CONTOUR had three customers: congress, t he public/science community, and their sponsor 
(NASA Discovery Program).  Congress is a harder customer to please, but plays an important 
role in determining future funding.  CONTOUR believed that the best way to satisfy their 
congressional customer was to do quality science and have a successful project.  All Discovery 
Program missions are based on a scientific inquiry , which is usually defined by the scientific 
community.  For CONTOUR mission objectives addressed the area of greatest importance 
identified by the Committee on Planetary and Lunar Exploration (COMPLEX) in its 
recommendations on the exploration of primitive bodies (e.g. comets).  As a mission selected via 
the NASA Discovery Program AO process, the science community played a key role in the 
approval of CONTOUR and its science goals.  T he involvement of the science community was 
further enhanced by CONTOUR presentations in c onferences and scientific meetings, as well as 
early release of all data to the Planetary Data System (PDS).  For the general public, CONTOUR 
had an Education and Public Outreach effort planned to include the general public and 
educational institutions in the mission.  This  was to be done primarily via a public website and 
materials generated by the CONTOUR team.  The Di scovery Program Office was an integral part 
of the project, and CONTOUR actively kept them  involved and informed through regular briefings 
and their involvement in reviews. 
 
Contractor Involvement 
 
CONTOUR strived to make contractors an int egral part of the team.  CONTOUR management 
described the relationship with their contract ors as active, with regular meetings via 
teleconference.  As the instruments were bei ng built, lead engineers would visit contract vendors 
for face-to-face meetings.  Most of the APL invo lvement with the contractors was left to the lead 
engineers.  Chiu did not participate in most of these communications .  The MIB later reported that 
the linkages with contractors was weak, which was evident in the proj ects understanding of the 
subsystems during integration.   
CONTOUR 29Tools  
 For CONTOUR, there were no unique tools used to  manage the project.  The one tool that was 
used by CONTOUR, is used by many NASA space science projects, and unique to NASA is 
Earned Value Management (EVM). EVM is a st andard NASA way of running planetary flight 
projects and performance metrics.  EVM is bas ed on a set of project tasks, and each task has a 
cost to complete and/or items to procure.  Each task and procurement has a schedule for completion, and as each one is completed, a monet ary credit is assigned.  These credits are then 
graphed against how much money has been spent t hus far on the project to determine where 
project progress follows on the curve.  
 
Knowledge Management 
 
CONTOUR believed that they had basic full documentation needed to be a “full blown NASA 
mission:” project plan, system requirements document, test plans, formal test procedures, 
MSPSP, safety plan EMC plans, component specifications, performance assurance 
implementation plan, procurement plan. From these they had flow-down documents where the 
subsystem team members developed flow-down r equirements documents.  All of these were 
documents that went through a review and approv al process with signatures.  Like many 
Discovery Program missions, attempts were m ade to keep the documentation to a minimum.  
CONTOUR believed that a vigorous testing program  in addition to necessary redesign and retest 
compensated for a less than formal  documentation process.   
 
A fundamental issue associated with capturi ng and documenting project knowledge Chiu said 
was that engineers are notorious for not liking to wr ite memos.  She found t hat they were pretty 
good at writing responses on email in memo fo rm, so she substituted formal reporting and 
documentation with email communication where nec essary.  What documentation did exist, was 
kept in hard copy in Chiu’s office, and in el ectronic copy on a shared server.  In additon to 
required project documentation, CONTOUR main tained a record of engineering data, project 
review notes, and questions/answers from the re views.  All documentation was categorized and 
organized by the CONTOUR administrative assi stant, Mary Stevens. The shared server was 
maintained as an online library.  In the onli ne library, aside from engineering documentation, 
items such as policy statements, level of reviews,  what reviews were required, what constituted 
approvals, approval signatures were kept. 
 
Learning Process 
 
CONTOUR did not perform any lessons learned mi ning from previous projects before starting 
CONTOUR.  Lessons learned from pervious pr ojects were captured by CONTOUR through 
people’s institutional knowledge.  One of the events that were unique to CONTOUR was that the 
Mars 98 mishaps occurred during the developm ents of CONTOUR.  This prompted NASA and 
CONTOUR to react quickly to the Mars 98 mis hap investigation and the MIB’s recommendations.  
Reynolds stated:  
We were extremely mindful of the i ssues that happened on the spacecraft right 
before us, and with the Mars failures and the Mars Observer failure, we were making damn sure that we were not going to repeat the same problems that they 
had.  But something else got us. 
 CONTOUR placed extra emphasis on testing and re viewing many of the same systems that 
caused the Mars 98 failures while paying less att ention to other subsystems that had greater 
technological uncertainty.  Post-project, other than the CONTOUR Mishap Investigation Board’s 
CONTOUR 30work, there was no extensive amount of effo rt placed on documenting and reporting lessons 
learned from CONTOUR. 
CONTOUR 31Adapting Project Management to Project Type 
 
CONTOUR was a strategic project that would help APL maintain and build upon their growing 
competitive edge in deep space missions.  In additi on, Cornell would begin to build a strategic 
position as an academic leader in space explorati on.  Without a framework to truly understand the 
fit that is needed between the project management style and the risk of the project, CONTOUR 
was approached more as an operational project.  T hey believed that they  were improving on 
existing products using technology and concepts fr om previous missions (NEAR and Stardust).  
While the technology may have been proven, the concepts and challenges of rendezvousing with 
a comet were not.  Without a good framework to  identify this, it created fuzziness between being 
an operational or strategic project. They did under stand who was their customer.  There is a fine 
line between a NASA project’s internal or ex ternal customer, but CONTOUR understood their 
ultimate customer was the Discovery Program (NASA).  The outcome for CONTOUR was a 
tangible product of a spacecraft, orbiter, and scientif ic instruments with an intellectual activity.  
CONTOUR required a significant level of insi ght and creativity both technically and managerially 
built around a core of talented, experienced people to produce a valued product. 
 
The NCTP Model below represents the analysis of  CONTOUR in respects to its Novelty, 
Complexity, Technology, and Pace.  Connecting the NCTP classification with a straight line to 
form a diamond, gives a representation of the leve l of risk associated with a project.  The greater 
the area of the diamond, the great er the degree of risk.  Also presented in the model, is how 
CONTOUR differed in its level of risk and how the project assumed a lower level of risk.  While 
there is not a linear relationship between the area of the diamond for correct and incorrect project 
risk, it does represent a difference in the degree of risk.

CONTOUR 32Novelty :  CONTOUR was a breakthrough project.  No one in the history of space exploration had 
brought a spacecraft as close to a comet as CONTO UR would.  Almost all of the technology they 
were using existed or was previously test ed or being tested on NEAR and Stardust.  Although 
APL had been successful with recent missions , not one successful mission had been repeated.  
Each mission, even if using similar, proven technology from past missions, had some degree of 
unproven technology and was a new venture.  CONT OUR was no exception.  There was still a lot 
to be learned about how to perform an Earth swing- by and rendezvous with a comet.  Traveling to 
a comet incorporated a lot of calculated risks, intuition, and trial and error.  CONTOUR would 
require fast prototyping, late design freezes, and constant interactions with their customers. 
 In many respects, CONTOUR was very new, as this technology was being packaging into a new 
product with a new, first-time-used, non-coher ent DOPPLER navigation system and the SRM had 
to be integrated into the spacecraft to perform  the scheduled Earth swing-by maneuvers.  This 
novelty in technology alone defines CONTOUR as  a breakthrough project, but it was managed as 
a platform project.  Without a framework to  understand the right managem ent style, management 
believed that they were building upon the su ccess and technology of past missions (NEAR and 
Stardust) and approached this projec t as a derivative project.  Th is gave the perception that 
CONTOUR would be a next generation in existing tec hnology.  Few projects in space exploration 
can be defined as platform projects (e.g . Expendable Launch Vehicles – Delta II, Atlas). 
 
Complexity : As a very complex interaction of s ubsystems and elements performing multiple 
functions, CONTOUR was a system project.  CONTOUR was a system project that understood 
the integration and complexity of that integrat ion to develop a spacecraft.  CONTOUR was truly a 
collection of interactive elements working t ogether for a common goal, exploring a comet.  
Spacecraft development was lead by APL, Corne ll lead the science, and other institutions 
subcontracted to develop the scientif ic instruments.  CONTOUR had multiple key customers from 
industry, public, government, and the scientific co mmunity that were all vested in CONTOUR’s 
development and success.  As a sy stems project CONTOUR was a complex project that required 
extensive planning, computerized tools and software, hundreds or t housands of activities, tight 
and formal control, financial and schedule iss ues, reviews with customers and management, and 
extensive documentation. 
 
While much of the development occurred in-house at APL, a significant portion of the scientific 
development occurred externally to APL.  Th is geographic separation between major systems 
and management (Principle Investigator and Projec t Manager) restricted real-time, face-to-face 
communication.  While CONTOUR understood the subs ystems of the spacecraft very well, a lack 
of framework to define unique project characteristi cs resulted in performing integration testing late 
in the development, thus not giving them a full under standing of the uncertainty  of the system.  In 
addition, being a heavily matrixed organization, team  members were not privileged with the ability 
of cutting ties to their parent organiza tions to fully commit to the project. 
 Technology :  CONTOUR was a high-tech project.  T he technology was mostly proven technology 
but being applied in a new way.  There were signi ficant improvements made to the technology to 
develop CONTOUR from its original design, with mi nor modification to bring it together to function 
as a complete system.  CONTOUR required l ong periods of design, development, testing, and 
redesign with multiple design cycles that had to  start before the project started.  With the 
extensive testing that was requi red for a high-tech project like CONTOUR, in depth, technical 
reviews were mandatory to make a project of th is complexity successful.  In conjunction with 
these reviews, communication had to be frequent and active.  The complexity and communication 
demands required management to be of good techni cal skills and intimately involved in the 
project.  They also had to recognize the unique challenges of CONTOUR and be flexible to 
extensive testing and design changes.  Theref ore, design freezes had to be scheduled and as 
late as possible.   
CONTOUR 33 
 
 
Without a NASA-specific framework for distinguishing CONTOUR’s unique technology 
characteristics, CONTOUR assumed a lower level of  uncertainty in the technology that they were 
using for the mission, and managed the project more like a medium-tech project.  This resulted in 
an approached to the technology as a non-revoluti onary improvement to past missions when the 
application of the technology was very much the fi rst of its kind.  Devel opment and testing of the 
integration of the SRM was limited and did not re ceive extensive review. Communication was not 
as frequent with subcontractors and key cont ributors as needed for a high-tech project. 
 
Pace :  CONTOUR was a blitz-critical project.  From  the time the project got the green light, they 
were under the pressure to meet a specified launc h opportunity with a strict schedule.  Time was 
critical for project success, and delays meant project failure.  The project team had to be 
specifically picked for CONTOUR and they were considered a special group trying to achieve a 
rapid solution to a vital project.  Proc edures had to be shortened, made simple, and non-
bureaucratic, while top management had to remain highly involved and constantly supportive.   
 The huge success of BFC at the time of CONTOUR built a confidence in Discover Class Missions 
and gave the appearance that they may be managed like a fast-competitive project.  While 
management understood they were under a constrained ti me factor, they believed that the project 
could be accomplished with matrixed team mem bers maintaining a 40-hour workweek.  In 
addition, not having access to a framework to  determine the project risk led management to 
believe that events such as integrations and te sting could occur late and less frequently in the 
project.  The consequence was that there was not  the sense of urgency as seen in successful 
BFC projects. 
 
Success Factors 
Wide spread faults were hard to find in CONTO UR, and it embodied many of  the characteristics 
of successful Discovery Program missions.  Managem ent brought to the project years of success, 
and a firm belief that they knew what it would take to make CONTOUR successful.  Factors that 
may have contributed to CONTOUR’s prospective success were: 
 
• Strategy 
o Strategy was determined ear ly and articulated often 
o Objectives were simple, attainable, measurable, and valuable 
o Defined objectives based on customer needs 
o Competitively selected 
• Spirit 
o Focused, unspoken, common commitment 
o Team empowerment 
• Organization 
o Limited involvement from top-management 
o People worked the project from beginning to end 
o Maintained only a core workforce 
• Processes 
o Stuck to the requirements 
o Informal (peer) reviews 
o Active communication 
 
CONTOUR 34A concerted amount of effort went into the pr eparation of the proposal and early developments of 
CONTOUR, and thus significant t hought went into determining CONT OUR’s strategy for success.  
The key visionaries and a handpicked project m anager dedicated themselves to defining and 
later articulating the strategy.  Mary Chiu believed as Project Manager, it was her sole 
responsibilities to communicate frequently and clearly  CONTOUR’s strategy to the project team.  
She believed she had to keep the team focused and she should use all powers necessary to 
make that happen.  The strategy for CONT OUR could not have been successful without 
attainable and measurable objectives defined by t he customer.  CONTOUR believed that their 
objectives had to be simple, attainable based on the resources, measurable by their customers, 
and valuable to the scientific community.  While these objectives never had the opportunity to be 
met, each day the project team worked with  a clear understand and commitment to those 
objectives.  The proposal team that put the competitively selected CO NTOUR proposal together 
clearly understood their competit ive advantage and who were their competitors.  The proposal 
team looked outside the normal proposal proc ess and was able to identify and define their 
competition and what set them apart from ever yone else.  With a clear understanding of there 
competitive advantage, they  were able to articulate this advantage through the proposal selection 
process. 
 In many Discovery Program missions, there is  a camaraderie and common commitment that can 
only be understood by those that have worked on a Di scovery project.  With a short development 
time and a challenge usually unparalleled in s pace exploration, team members develop a 
focused, unspoken commitment to the projec t and its success.  For CONTOUR this was 
described as ‘family.’  People belie ved that that they were contributing to something special, and 
the success or failure of any one system, subsys tem, or component, was a lose to the team.  
They truly believed that they were successf ul as one unit and thus would fail as one unit.  
Management points to the empowerment  of the team as part of t he reason for a dedicated team.  
Management believed that decisions had to co me from the people making the project happen on 
the day-to-day.  They made sure  that team members were empowered to make decisions, and 
speak up when they were not comfortable with a decision.  Team members were given the tools 
or access to the tools they needed to do their job.  
Limited top-management involvement is a comm on trend in Discovery Program projects, and 
CONTOUR was no exception.  Top-management pl ayed a limited role in the direction of 
CONTOUR.  While kept informed, they let CONTOUR management perform the job they were 
hired to do.  While not all of the people that worked on the project during the proposal phase were 
part of the development phase, t hose that started with the pr oject at the beginning of the 
development phase saw the project through to the end.  Partly because of budgetary constraints, 
the workforce was kept to a core minimum, but once a good engineer, scientist, or reviewer was 
part of the project they were retained.  People that started with the pr oject at the development 
phase carried through to the assembly and then operation phases.  It was a cradle-to-grave, 
keep-it-in-the-family mentality.  
CONTOUR set requirements early and stuck to  them.  Management had a firm understanding of 
the schedule constraints that CONTOUR was under.  This meant there was very little room for 
changing direction, thus once t he requirements were set, they were able to freeze the design 
early and focus on assembly in time to make their deadlines.  Mary Chiu was praised for her 
firmness on the requirements, being able to tell an engineer “no,” and knowing when to freeze the 
design.  CONTOUR understood the value and import ance of reviews, and more importantly who 
were the reviewers.  CONTOUR sought exper ienced and knowledgeable review team members, 
and when they found a good reviewer, they did ev erything in their power to retain them 
throughout the project. While the reviews ma y not have been as encompassing of the entire 
system as they should have been (i ncluding certain subcontracted subs ystems), they were many.  
Management stressed active, frequent communica tion between team members.  If a team 
CONTOUR 35member was not co-located they made sure they  could contribute via phone.  If problems arose, 
management made sure the resolution was achi eved with good, immediate communication. 
 
Recommendations 
The CONTOUR MIB specified that there we re two major managerial errors, and inadequate 
systems engineering process and review function.  These two principles were fundamental to 
CONTOUR’s success and failure.  
 
Recommendation 1 – Understand the technological uncertainty to apply the right management approach:   The fundamental factor in CONTOUR’s failure can be related to a 
reliance on past success and inherited sy stems that lead to a false s ense of confidence.   No one 
in the history of space exploration had ever brought a spacecraft as close to a comet as 
CONTOUR would.  While they were using predom inantly existing, off-the-shelf technology and 
technology from previous missions (NEAR and Star dust), CONTOUR was flying for the very first 
time a non-coherent DOPPLER navigation system and a SRM that was not thoroughly tested with 
the spacecraft.  Fundamental to gener al systems theory are four basic  assumption: (1) the sum is 
greater than the parts and there are consequenc es for not understanding the dynamics of each 
part, (2) there is multi-lateral causality betw een subsystems, systems, and the environment they 
function in; (3) one set of initial conditions can give  rise to different final states; and (4) there is 
concern with the flow of inform ation between subsystems (components).
6  The lack of a 
framework that could help understand the fit that is needed between the project management 
style and the risk resulted in CONTOUR not being able to identify key areas of risk in the 
integration of subsystems.  The Deep Space Ne twork team and the navigation team recognized 
some of these uncertainties, which caused a hi gh level of discomfort between teams and in the 
processes. While CONTOUR attempted to overcome  this with extensive testing, the extensive 
testing did not extend throughout  the integration phase.   
 Recommendation 3 – Avoid overconfidence from past success:   BFC was pushing the 
enveloped of doing high-tech projects cheaper.  M eet the cost challenges of BFC, CONTOUR 
management believed that they were buildi ng upon the success and technology of NEAR and 
Stardust.  This may have led to a false s ense of confidence by CONTOUR management based 
on the successes of NEAR and Stardust, t hus management approached CONTOUR as a next 
generation in existing technology (platform).  Few projects in space exploration can be defined as 
platform projects (e.g. Expendable Launch Vehicles – Delta II, Atlas).  By approaching this project 
as a derivative of other projects, there were unable to compensate for the risk and uncertainty in 
what they were trying to accomplish.  To  compound this, the implementation of the NASA 
Integrated Action Team’s (NIAT) recommendation from  their investigation of the Mars 98 failures 
were coming out almost three quarters of the wa y through CONTOUR’s project life cycle.  This 
resulted in CONTOUR management directing a signifi cant amount of attention to similar issues 
on CONTOUR, and may have drawn attention away from other subsystems that needed 
attention.  Recommendation 4 – Resolve leadership conflicts quickly and have clear lines of 
leadership:   A project team relies on their leadership to guide them and provide them with their 
strategic focus and vision.  Some managers comment ed that conflicting direction came from top 
management, and it was not always clear who with in top management was in charge.  Conflict 
and undefined leaders only lead to confusion down through the organization.

NJ: Hayden Book Company. 
CONTOUR 36Recommendation 5 – Key subsystems should be co-located:   BFC missions have been 
successful because of co-locati on, and CONTOUR had significant portions of the project in 
significantly separate locations, the spacecraft at  APL (Maryland), the science at Cornell (Ithaca, 
New York), and the SRMs at a Contractor.  While  CONTOUR worked very hard to achieve active 
communication through telephone, email, and scheduled site visits, an engineer or scientist could 
not always walk down the hall to get the answer to their question. 
 
Recommendation 5 – Team members should be 100% on the project (cradle to grave):   
Because of a limited budget, CONTOUR was forced to  rely on the matrix organization.  In a 
project that has a strict schedule such as a Discovery Program mission, team members should 
cut ties with their home organization and become 100%  part of the project they are supporting.  
This may have been the case for the management, but it was not the case with all of the team 
members.  While the spirit and commitment by team members was high, many team membes 
were still anchored to their matrixed organization.  Th is resulted in a lack of a sense of urgency.  
Team members through almost the entire projec t worked 40-hour weeks and rarely weekends.  In 
projects with limited schedules and fixed launch dat es, team members routinely work extra hours 
to guarantee project success. 
 
Recommendation 6 – Independent reviews should be in depth, technical reviews with 
active communication with experts outside of the review:  CONTOUR had a good frequency 
of independent and peer reviews in the project, but there were no consistent linkages to those 
review members outside of the actual reviews and they addressed only top-level issues.  There 
should have been more linkages to review members and independent experts while addressing 
in-depth technical issues.

Mars Climate Orbiter 1Executive Summary 
 
In 1993, NASA started the Mars Surveyor Program to  develop a series of missions to study Mars.  
A Mars Program Office was established and given the responsibility of defining the objectives of 
these Mars exploration missions.  Chartered under this office would be two missions with biennial 
launching opportunities (Mars Climate Orbite r and Mars Polar Lander).  The Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory (JPL) created the Mars Surveyor Projec t ’98 (Mars ‘98), which would be responsible 
for these missions.  One of these missions, the Mars Climate Orbiter (MCO), was a strategic 
project that would help build a sustained position in space exploration with recent successes in 
Mars exploration (Mars Pathfinder and Mars Gl obal Surveyor).  MCO would build upon those 
successes, and lay the groundwork for several pl anned Mars exploration missions over the next 
15 years.  MCO was a tangible product of a spac ecraft, orbiter, and scientific instruments which 
required a significant level of insight and creat ivity both technically and managerially built around 
a core of talented, experienced people to produce a valued product.   
 
As a project MCO was to design, test, develop,  launch and operate an orbiter that would collect 
weather data from Mars and act as a relay station for five years, assisting in data transmission to 
and from the Mars Polar Lander (MPL).  Join tly developed with the MPL and 300 people from JPL 
and Lockheed Martin, they had a 37-month dev elopment schedule with spacecraft launch 
masses of a medium-light class launch v ehicle, and a financial cap of about $184 million 
(covering development of the s pacecraft, scientific payloads, and t he ground operations system).  
As a project MCO was a high-tech project wi th development of one-of -a-kind single flight 
systems.  While some of the technology was new, mu ch of it existed at the time the project was 
initiated.  What was unique was how the technol ogy was brought together in a single spacecraft.  
The complexity of the project could be described as  a system.  As is the case with all deep space 
missions, they are a collection of interactive el ements and subsystems that must perform a wide 
range of functions under extreme conditions.  The pace of the project was a blitz-critical project.  
Time and budgets became fixed and any error in either  of these areas meant cancellation for the 
project. 
 
On September 23, 1999, MCO would begin its or biter insertion maneuver, but shortly after 
beginning orbit insertion, the signal was lost from MCO, and on September 24 search for the 
orbiter was abandoned.  On September 30, a JPL peer review committee reported that small 
forces of velocity changes reported by the spacec raft engineers for use in orbit insertion were low 
and the likely causes of the MCO lose.  On Oct ober 6, a MCO Mission Failure Investigation Board 
was appointed by NASA to independently look into all aspects of the failure of the mission.  On 
November 10, the Board released their report that  idenified the root cause for the loss of the 
MCO spacecraft as the failure to use metric units in the coding of a ground software file. 
 While the root technical cause was a coding of me tric units in the software, the over arching 
cause of the MCO failure was a stategy desi gned to cost and not capability.  This can be 
attribued to the pressures and challenges of BFC whic h resulted in cuts in areas that later proved 
to be key in contributing to MCO’s failure.  Be cause of cost constrains, peer reviews were de-
emphasized, there was not an active involvem ent from experts, dual development was used on 
subsystems for multiple missions, the number of  people on the project was kept below minimum, 
expertise for key subsystems was unavailable to  the project, testing was streamlined in key 
areas, and key policy was reduced.  Designing to c apabilities may have revealed that this project 
could not have been done under the specified budget.  Wi th all of its constraints, the MCO team 
maintained a high spirit with an unmatched driv e to be successful.  Unfortunately, not managing 
the spirit resulted in team members overworki ng themselves and maintaining a consistent energy 
level from beginning to end.

Mars Climate Orbiter 8Background 
 
NASA was beaming with a string of storied succe sses from the Discovery Program and showing 
all of its critics that ‘better, faster, c heaper’ (BFC) could be successful.  The agency had been so 
successful with its previous t en BFC missions that they never saw what was coming September 
23 and December 4, 1999.  It was what did not happen on September 23 with Mars Climate 
Orbiter and later on December 4 with Mars Po lar Lander that forced NASA and the space science 
community to take a long hard look at how it  managed its projects and wondering if BFC could be 
successful. 
 
In 1993, the National Aeronautics and Space Admini stration (NASA) started the Mars Surveyor 
Program with the intent of performing a series of missions to explore Mars.  The Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory was commissioned as the lead center fo r this program, and Mars Global Surveyor 
(MGS) was identified as the c harter mission.  To follow MGS would be Mars Climate Orbiter 
(MCO) and Mars Polar Lander (MPL).  To champion MCO and MPL missions, JPL established 
the Mars Surveyor Project ’98 (Mars 98) office  with the responsibility of defining and developing 
the spacecraft and all payload elements, and int egrating, testing, and launching both flight 
systems.  Additionally, the Mars  Surveyor Operation Project (MSOP) would be responsible for 
conducting flight operations for MGS, MCO, and MP L.   JPL selected an industry partner with 
Lockheed Martin Astronautics for the Mars Survey or Program to develop the spacecraft.  This 
intensely competitive contract would give Lock heed Martin the opportunity for eight spacecraft for 
Mars opportunities, the first of which was MGS.   JPL envisioned duplicating the spacecraft for 
every opportunity, so the spacecraft development  would become “carbon copies” for subsequent 
opportunities. JPL believed that this could result in  immense cost savings in the long-term.  While 
the Mars Surveyor Program mission was not part of  the Discovery Program, the hallmark of BFC, 
they were charted to follow the principles of  BFC and manage them accordingly.  But, after the 
MCO’s orbit insertion failed on September 23 and MPL crashed into the surface of Mars on 
December 4, wide-ranging and critical managerial and technical actions were taken by NASA, 
Congress, the scientific community, and the medi a to determine what went wrong, what was 
wrong at NASA, and could BFC work. 
 
Mission Description  
MCO was to have mission duration of two years where it would accomplish its entire science 
objectives (See Figure 1 for project timeline).  It was then planned to operate an additional three 
years as a relay station for the Mars Po lar Lander and the 2001 Lander mission.  The orbiter 
would carry two instruments: the Pressure M odular Infrared Radiometer (PMIRR) and the Mars 
Color Imager (MARCI).  These two instruments would work to accomplish the following science 
objectives:  
1. Monitor the daily weather  and atmospheric conditions. 
2. Record changes on the Martian surface due to wind and other atmospheric effects. 
3. Determine temperature pr ofiles of the atmosphere. 
4. Monitor the water vapor and dus t content of the atmosphere. 
5. Look for evidence of past climate change. 
 
The PMIRR would provide the detailed informat ion about the atmospheric temperature, dust, 
water vapor, clouds, and carbon dioxide that is  added and removed from the poles.  The MARCI 
consisted of two cameras that would obser ve the behavior of the Martian atmosphere and 
interaction between the atmosphere and the planet  surface.  A successful mission would have 
Mars Climate Orbiter 9yielded the atmospheric conditions on Mars thr ough each of its seasons and give a glimpse of 
Mars past and future weather conditions.  
 
MCO was launched on a Delta II Lite launch vehicle December 11, 1998 from Launch Complex 17 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Flori da.  After launch, MCO would spend the next nine 
and a half month traversing through space toward  Mars.  On September 23, 1999, MCO would 
begin its orbiter insertion maneuver before start of the aerobraking process.  At 09:00:46 (UTC) 
MCO began orbit insertion, but a short four minutes later and 49 seconds ahead of the schedule 
Mars’ occultation, the signal was lost from MCO.   After a 21 minute predicted occultation interval, 
signal was not reacquired, and engineers spend the next two days unsuccessfully attempting to 
communicate with MCO.  On September 24, search for the orbiter was abandoned, and on 
September 27, the operati ons navigation team and the spacecraft engineers debated 
discrepancies regarding velocity change, only to di scover on September 29 that the small forces 
of velocity change’s reported by the spacecraft engi neers for use in orbit insertion were low by a 
factor of 4.45.  On September  30, a JPL peer review committee confirmed these as the likely 
cause of the Orbiter lose.  October 6, Dan Goldin, NASA Administrator, appointed Arthur G. 
Stephenson, Director of NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center, to be the head of the Mars 
Climate Orbiter Mission Failure Investigation Board (MIB).  The MIB would look independently 
into all aspects of the failure of the mission,  and report its initial findings to NASA Headquarters 
by November 3, 1999.  On Novem ber 10, the MIB released the report, Mars Climate Orbiter 
Mishap Investigation Board Phase I Report.   In this report they idenify the root cause for the loss 
of the MCO spacecraft as the failu re to use metric units in t he coding of a ground software file.

Mars Climate Orbiter 10Technology Description 
Once in orbit around Mars, MCO’s science mission wa s to last two Earth years collecting data.  
But of most significance was that the Orbiter would act as a relay station for three additional 
years, assisting the MPL and a 2001 Lander mission. 
 
Aboard the Orbiter were two instruments: the Pr essure Modulator Infrared Radiometer (PMIRR), 
and the Mars Color Imager (MARCI). PMIRR wa s to provide detailed information about the 
atmospheric temperature on Mars, dust, water v apor, and clouds. Most significantly it would 
provide valuable information about the fluctuat ions in carbon dioxide, Mars most abundant 
atmospheric gas, at the poles during a Marti an Year.  PMIRR was a nine-channel limb and nadir 
scanning atmospheric sounder desi gned to vertically profile 
atmospheric temperature, dust, water vapor and condensate 
clouds and to quantify surface radiative balance. PMIRR 
observed in a broadband visible channel, calibrated by 
observations of a solar target mounted on the instrument, and in eight spectral intervals between 6 and 50 µm in the 
thermal infrared.  PMIRR science observations were to start 
only after the PMIRR radiator door was fully opened. Once PMIRR was deployed in the mapping orbit, vertical profiles 
of atmospheric properties were  to be constructed.  MARCI 
was comprised of two cameras that would observe the behavior of the Martian atmo sphere and interaction between 
the atmosphere and the surfac e of the planet.   MARCI 
combined Wide Angle (WA) and Medium Angle (MA) cameras with individual optics but identical focal plane 
assemblies, data acquisition sy stem electronics, and power 
supplies. Each camera was small in size (6 x 6 x 12 cm, including baffle) and mass (combined mass 2 kg). The 
cameras were electronically shuttered at intervals timed so 
that the spacecraft motion spatia lly overlaps each filter strip 
view, thereby providing a "color" composite.  N ear the end of the Orbite r's cruise phase, MARCI 
was to acquire approach images of Mars. Once in  the mapping orbit, MARCI would provide daily 
global images of the Mars atmosphere (and surfac e) with the WA camera and monitor surface 
changes with the MA camera during mission periods with high data rates.  
 
If MCO were successful, scientist would 
have been able to witness the atmospheric 
conditions on Mars through each of its seasons.  This kind of information is key to 
understanding Mars’ past and even the 
evolution of Earth.  Once MCO arrived at 
Mars it was scheduled to perform a 
burnout of the 3rd stage, followed by a yo-
yo de-spin of the entire stack, and then spacecraft separation. From this point both 
the spacecraft and upper stage have been 
injected onto a Type 2 trajectory to assure that the upper stage has less probability of 
impacting Mars, as required by Planetary 
Protection regulations.  Although this is 
where MCO was lost, if it had continued on its scheduled deployment, the solar panels would 
have been deployed and pointed to the sun, and init ial acquisition achieved by the Deep Space 
NASA-JPL
NASA-JPL 
Mars Climate Orbiter 11Network (DSN). Approximately 15 days after launc h, the largest Trajectory Correction Maneuver 
was executed, which was supposed to remove l aunch vehicle injection errors. Provisions had 
been made to execute up to 3 additional small Trajectory Correction Maneuvers during the 
remainder of the cruise, as needed, to shape the orbit and direct the spacecraft to the proper 
Mars Orbit Insertion.  Although, navigation anom alies (units error) observed during the cruise 
from Earth to Mars were not appropriately addre ssed.  With insufficient preparation, the chance 
for final trajectory correction maneuvers was not employed.  The Orbiter engines were to be used 
to insert the spacecraft into an elliptical captur e orbit.  Over the next two months, the energy of 
the orbit is reduced via successive passes through the atmosphere of Mars, controlled by small 
Orbit Trim Maneuvers. Once aero-braking was complete, two maneuvers were to transfer the 
Orbiter to its final, frozen, near sun- synchr onous mapping orbit. This was to occur long before 
the MPL’s arrival in December 1999.  During the Mars Polar Lander's surface operations, the 
Orbiter was to provide command and data relay support for three years, and maintain a limited 
level of orbital science.  
 
 
Mars Climate Orbiter 12Strategic Project Leadership 
 
Strategy  
 
Objectives 
 
As a Mars Exploration Program project with a programmatic mission, MCO’s objectives were 
defined by scientific community needs.  The Ma rs Exploration Program is interested in 
investigating the existence of water on Mars and if it exists, what happened to it.  Water is a 
fundamental building block of lif e and the existence of water (past or present) would lead to 
proving once and for all if life exists or exis ted on Mars.  The theme for the program has been 
’Follow the Water.’  Using information from  the MGS, MCO would have follow-up scientific 
objectives defined by some of the most disti nguished scientist (some of the National Academy of 
Science). 
 
Competitive Advantage/Value 
 
“We pushed the boundaries like never before…And had not yet reached what we thought was the 
limit.”  - Daniel S. Goldin, remarks at JPL March 29, 2000 
 
NASA had selected JPL to lead the Mars Surveyor Program because of their lengthy history of 
Mars exploration.  But, for JPL to select Lock heed Martin Astronautics as the prime contractor to 
develop the spacecraft for Mars 98 was a very com petitive selection proce ss.  The contractor 
selected to lead the Mars 98 spacecraft devel opment would be winning a contract to develop 
eight Mars exploration spacecraft.  Lockheed Mart in had originally bid quiet aggressively since 
they had already had MGS in progress at the ti me.  Lockheed Martin believed they had a very 
rich history in Mars exploration (i.e. Viking), and they were very motivated to win this program.  
Later Lockheed Martin management would be told that  their proposal stood far above all the rest.  
The project manager that preceded Ed Euler, Lockheed Martin Project Manager, was a very 
experienced vice president within Lockheed Martin and to win the contract really cut everything 
down to the minimum. In the end, Lockheed Mart in won the Mars 98 contract because of two 
factors, experience and cost.  Unfortunately, cost would become MCO’s biggest challenge and a 
catalyst to its failure. 
 
Once the project started the co mpetitive advantage transitioned into value.  Part of MCO’s value 
was to make up for the science that was lost  on the Mars Observer.  While MGS had repeated 
most of what was lost on Mars Observer, MC O would fill in the additional gaps in scientific 
inquiry.  MCO would ultimately deliver to the scientific community new and intriguing data on our 
closest planet.  Mars is attractive to the sci entific community and the general public, because it 
has an atmosphere and the potential of past or pr esent water.  To the scientific and general 
imagination, an atmosphere fosters a belief in past life and a future human presence on a habitable place in the near neighborhood of Earth.   The successful Mars Pathfinder and MGS had 
broadened and deepened that imagination.  MCO was to bring a new hope and enthusiasm to 
everyone that believed in space exploration.  MCO would lay t he groundwork for a continued U.S. 
exploration of Mars.  A successful mission woul d show to Congress that quality space science 
could occur with reduced budgets, and build the Congressional support NASA needed for a 
struggling agency.   
 
Mars Climate Orbiter 13Business Perspective (Success Dimensions) 
 
“To put it your way, ‘What they did to guar antee success.’ I would address that question from a 
different view.  Which is what did they do to try to guarantee that it did not fail?” 
- Peter Rutledge, personal interview 
 
As with any planetary mission, there is very li ttle leeway for failure.  Planetary missions are 
restricted based on a window of opportunity due to  celestial alignment (launch windows).  MCO 
was no exception.  While MCO worked towards a self-measurement of success that appeared to 
be straight forward, it was what MCO benchmarked itself against that was harder to define.  As 
with many NASA projects post-Apo llo, it is really hard for project teams to benchmark themselves 
against something.  Rarely is there anyone to  beat or is anyone doing anything even remotely 
similar.  As with MCO, they ultimately benc hmarked themselves against what they promised. 
 
The Mars Exploration Program had a vision to go to Mars every three years (every time there was 
a launch opportunity), and learn as much as they c ould about Mars, it’s history, and it’s future.  
The Mars Exploration Program was very confi dant they could deliver, and building on the past 
successful missions to Mars.  These and previ ous Mars missions that had been successful leant 
to a frame of mind that ‘We had done this before,  successfully orbited Mars, and other planetary 
bodies, so we can do it again, and it is not so hard.’  The MIB viewed this attitude as over 
confidence.  
Even though, MCO was viewed as the next step in a line of investigative missions to explore the 
Red Planet.  MCO’s success would be measured on its ability to stay within budget and on 
schedule while maintaining the science objectives (one of the most critical factors in determining 
MCO’s success).  Noel Hinners, Lockheed Martin  Program Manager, said that the potential 
success of MCO could have been judged falsely had it worked on Mars and got tremendous science results.  If MPL had failed and MCO been successful, “You would say 50/50, we got one 
out of two. Faster, better, cheaper approach can work and you would cruise on.”  Hinners says 
that a bright spot in the two failures was t hat JPL and Lockheed Martin were on a path to do a 
Mars sample return in the ’03 and ’05 timeframe.  These missions would be based on the same 
faster, better, cheaper approach and proj ected price.  Hinners stated,  
 
There is no way, NO WAY, that mission could have been done for anywhere 
near what people were talking about at t he time and think that they would get 
success out of it.  So the failures said to people, Whoa, this faster, better, 
cheaper, is not all that it is cranked up to be, at least not the way we are trying to 
implement it.  So that resulted in the end of the ’03, ‘05 sample return study, and 
the activity that was going on that woul d lead to a mission. And I say, ‘Thank 
God.’  In my view there is no way it could have ever worked.  It would have been 
an unbelievable, and much more costly embarrassment.  When you look for the 
bright points, the Mars 98 said, ‘God, I hope we have learned that lesson, that 
you cannot do these complex missions on the cheap.  You have got to have the 
right investments in them.’  
 
Strategic Focus 
 
“Came close but didn’t make it, and close doesn’t count.” 
 - Noel Hinners, personal interview 
 For MCO there was a drive to do good science, but  the drive to develop MCO at a bare minimum 
cost is what fostered the stra tegy.  JPL made several strategi c decisions, which ultimately 
became key for MCO, that were driven by cost.  One of those decisions was to use much of the 
Mars Climate Orbiter 14science from the failed Mars Observer.  The se cond was to award a contract for spacecraft 
development that would result in an opportunity for up to eight almost identical spacecraft. 
 
The culture of the scientist is always to want  to do more science, and the engineer that responds 
to ever scientists request will find themselves c onsumed by ever changing r equirements, resulting 
in a scope and strategy change.  Changes in scope dr ive cost.  Many projects have resulted in 
cost overruns because people responded to requi rements changes without changing the scope or 
strategy (i.e. Mars Observer and the Space Shuttle).  Ken Atki ns, Project Leadership Processor, 
stated that management has to say, “What you are asking for here is not  the job we originally bid.  
We cannot win the gold star with the money we  got adding these additional requirements.”  The 
‘better faster, cheaper’ missions were supposed to move away from that paradigm built on cost 
constrained missions and into a paradigm of a capab ility driven strategy.  The idea of a capability 
drive strategy is to take an inherited, given, or well, underst ood capability that one knows can be 
built and see if it captures enough science to satisf y the scientists and principle investigator.  For 
MCO, management were cost driven.  To accomp lish the most science for the least dollar, the 
project was designed around cost and not the science.   Cost became the performance floor that 
the project had to guard.  The strategy fo r MCO should have been built around the project 
scientific objectives and the follow-on of the successful Mars Global Surveyor, but as 
requirements crept, no one stood up and said, “No, or that it was not in line with the original 
scope and strategy of the project.” 
 In addition to the science strategy being driven by cost, so was the spacecraft development.  
Everyone was bidding on the Mars Surveyor Program , because they realized that this was more 
than just bidding on a spacecraft, but a unique opportuni ty for multiple spacecraft.  As a strategy, 
those bidding on the contract knew  that they may not profit on the development of the first 
spacecraft but each subsequent mission will have in creasing dividends.  This set a mood in the 
program, and as Hinners stated, “Your competit ive environment tends to push you to bidding 
lower cost to try and squeeze all of the cost out the first time.  To try to win.”  The strategy of 
building around a minimal and potentially inadequate budget, fostered for MCO a strategy that 
later was defined as not what was done to guar antee success but what was not done.   Hinners 
stated, “We did not do some of those essential things that im prove greatly your probability of 
success.”  
 
Mars Climate Orbiter 15Project Spirit and Leadership  
 Organizational Culture 
 
“It was very difficult for people to understand t he environment that the NASA administrator had 
established.  The axe he was holding over ever ybody.  It was a challenge we accepted, and we 
paid the consequences.”  Ed Euler, personal interview 
 
The culture in MCO was described as can-do, driven, independent, self-reliant, we know how to 
do it, we’ll get there, and a high degree of confi dence.  The people leading it were defined as 
good leaders and very capable.  With a low cost  and schedule driven mission, there was a sense 
of urgency and desire to succeed.  It also result ed in not being able to afford oversight or 
extensive testing, either wi th JPL or Lockheed Martin.  Therefore, the project developed a 
‘protective shield’ toward outside opinion.  
Atkins stated, “I think in most  cases a unique sort of characteri stic or culture evolves for each 
project, and it is largely a function of the management  and the kind of relationships that are built.”  
Atkins believed that the relationships management  builds are influenced and characterized by the 
type of contract the project functions under.  The contract type places restriction on how 
management can foster relationships.  MCO was a co st-plus contract with a certain amount of the 
fee paid to the contractor for its success.  “This builds a prime and sponsor relationship and not a 
team or collaborative culture,” says Atkins. 
 
Project Spirit 
 
“The team spirit was so good that it probably b linded us to the amount of work and stress that 
was existing on the project.” 
 - Noel Hinners, personal interview 
 For MCO, project spirit was described as the l east of their concerns.  Euler described it as, 
“phenomenal.”  The team was always highly motiva ted from project start through launch and into 
the cruise phase.  Euler said there was nothi ng he needed to do to worry about motivation, that 
was the easiest part of his job.  The people were  highly motivated.  Team members knew they 
were doing something challenging.  Hinners said, “There was not anybody who had any doubt 
that we were going to succeed.”  People put their hearts and souls into the project with a lot of 
time and even overtime, while maintaining an in credible enthusiasm.  Hinners described them as, 
“Just a bunch of space nuts.”  From management on down, they wanted to  show everyone that 
this could be done.  People devoted their lives, w eekends, and time as Euler stated.  While the 
team spirit was described as excellent, Hinners stated that this may have been deceptively so.  
MCO worked on the minimums in almost every area, and one of those was people.  Not having 
enough people, but dedicated, committed people, meant  people worked extra hard to get the job 
done and do it right.  This may have taxed the time and capabilities of the team. 
 
Policy to Support Strategy and Spirit 
 
“Sometimes the pendulum swings a little too far.” 
- Ken Atkins, personal interview 
 
JPL and Lockheed Martin’s culture and history are mainly on large flagship missions such as 
Galileo, Cassini, and Viking, which are billion dollar projects with 10 to 14 different instruments 
and a number of principle investigators.  With a budget and scientific objectives this significant it 
requires a large set of people.  Under Dan Gold in, former NASA Administrator, he wanted to do 
Mars Climate Orbiter 16more for less money and thus the birth of ‘faste r, better, cheaper’ and a new culture.  As one of 
the inaugural missions of ‘faster, better, cheaper,’  Mars Pathfinder, had a spirit that said, ‘get 
good people, get out of their way, and they will do a great job.’  While Mars Pathfinder may have 
been successful, not everyone attributes its success solely to hard work, good management, and 
an effective strategy.  While changing JPL policy to allow co-location and breaking some of the 
barriers to communication may have fostered the Pathfinder team spirit, some believe Mars 
Pathfinder was part of “providential experi ence.” Others at JPL and the NASA community 
sometime say that JPL means “Just Plain Lucky.”  When MCO started they attempted to embrace 
this reduction in policy to support the strategy and spirit of the project, but MCO shifted the 
pendulum too far as one manager stated.  Giving MC O the liberty to restrict or change policy, 
gave them the ability to do this to fit cost.  T herefore, policy for certain requirements was viewed 
as non-applicable to meet cost constraints. 
 
Leadership 
 
Many team members on MCO specified that leadership problems on MCO were centered on 
accountability and authority.  Team members at ti mes were not sure who was in charge or who 
was the mission manager.  Lines of leadership  were not clearly defined and some managers 
stepped outside their responsibilities.   Many project team members did not identify project 
managers as leaders.  The MIB specified t hat project managers were competent but 
inexperienced, with minimal senior level management involvement to balance the lack of 
experience.  While the leadership appeared positive,  enthusiastic, and convin ced that they could 
and would be successful, some identified this as an over-confidence.  O ne manager identified the 
leadership style as autocratic with tendencies to breed conflict.  A characteristic that was missing 
from the leadership was a collegial or trusting re lationship with team members.  Atkins stated, 
“The word trust is a very, very big element of ac hieving the kind of spirit  that you really need.”  
Leadership for MCO lacked a balance between conf idence and arrogance.  Some team members 
felt it was difficult to achieve a team spir it because they were pressured to perform as 
management wanted or they were not valued on the project. 
 
Team Empowerment 
 
MCO worked to empower team members and more  specifically subsys tem leads with the 
information and tools they needed to perform thei r job.  For Lockheed Martin, they emphasized 
empowerment more so than most missions.  T he team had a lot of autonomy, and team members 
were given in a very large part the autonomy to make their decisions.  While the project manager 
was ultimately accountable, they gave subsyste m leads a lot authority and accountability.  Euler 
stated that subsystem leads had full responsibilit y for their hardware, whether they were 
designing and building it themselves or contracti ng it out.  He did not believe in micromanaging, 
but in giving the responsibility to the leads.  Euler said, “We were ‘lean and mean’ at the time.  
We essentially had no checks and balances on the pr ogram as we do today.  I could not possibly 
execute that program under the env ironment that we live in today .”  While management worked to 
empower the team with relinquishing contro l over budgets and require ments, they were 
empowering a team of limited ex perience or depth.  Atkins st ates that the openness (managing at 
an arms length) to the navigation processes wh ile empowering junior engineers with limited depth 
was too much for those engineers to handle. 
  
Mars Climate Orbiter 17Organization  
 
Project Organization 
 What made MCO unique was that it was one of two pr ojects called Mars 98.  As part of Mars 98, 
MCO and MPL could have individually been classified as projects.  Each carried a complexity and 
uncertainty that could warrant a project organization all their own.  While they were two slightly 
different flight systems, they were not two unique budgets.  While the two projects 
organizationally functioned semi-independent, they shared a funding level of one project.  A 
consequence of this was that MCO was organized too broadly.  Atkins stated, “They had to 
organize in a way that tried to get as much quality and depth in both of these in an equal balance 
approach.”   This thinness in the organization resu lted in lack of oversight and balance in quality.  
People held dual responsibility on both spacecraft.  The computer systems were the most noted 
area where people had dual responsibility.  In a Discovery mission which is deemed less complex 
by NASA standards, that only has one spacecraft to build, it is ideal that the organization be as 
lean as possible with clear lines of author ity, and making sure the decisions get made 
appropriately.  While MCO was not a Discovery Pr ogram Mission, it was under the pressures of 
‘better, faster, cheaper,’ and thus worked toward s what many considered a ‘better, faster, 
cheaper’ standard organization structure.  Atkins defi ned this as having four hubs:   (1) the project 
management and the principle investigator, (2) t he science payload which is the responsibility of 
the principle investigator or the project scientis t, (3) the flight system s which are usually managed 
by a contractor, and (4) the mission engineeri ng and operations which deals with the early 
design, trajectory, navigation planning, ground systems, communica tions link from Earth to the 
spacecraft.   
 
Structure 
 
While MCO followed mostly classical development li nes, there were some areas that were a little 
different.  Because the MCO spac ecraft was viewed as the first in  a line of identical spacecraft 
some of the subsystem development was being per formed for multiple missions.  For example, 
certain subsystems being developed for MCO were  also being developed in parallel with the 
Stardust mission.  Therefore, certain parts of the MCO development were reliant a product 
development organization, and that organizati on had the responsibility for producing the 
subsystems that were common to three mi ssions: Stardust, MPL, and MCO.  Hinners said, 
“Project Managers tend not to like that.  They want to have total control over  everything they can; 
that is the ideal for them.  Having two proj ect managers having to work with a PDO, product 
development organization, frustrated the projec t managers a little bit but they worked it.” 
 
For the spacecraft development Lockheed Martin worked very hard to locate almost all of it in one 
building, and went out of their way to co-locate as many people as possibl e.  For example, the 
product development organization was on the first fl oor (one floor down from where the project 
was located), software development was the next floor, the mission support area was on the third 
floor, the developers were on the fourth floor, and test  facilities were right across the street.  JPL 
made sure that they had a number of team me mbers there on site at Lockheed Martin.  MCO 
believed that by co-locating a si gnificant portion of the team you have the operating team in close 
proximity to the developers so when an issue arises  with the performance of a subsystem or the 
software, the people who developed it are right t here.  Trying to have a good flow from the 
development team into operations wa s a key piece of the strategy. 
 
 
  
Mars Climate Orbiter 18Team Assembly 
 
“If you don’t spend the money on the people, you do not have enough of them to go and ask 
others as much as you should.“  - Ken Atkins, personal interview 
 
In the formulation stage, the leaders of the team, the project manager and the main subsystem 
leads, would competitively select team members with a selection board.  They would review 
candidate’s qualifications, judge them, and then have a selection.  Working with the central 
engineering organization they would try and identify peopl e with the right skills and availability. As 
Hinners stated, 
 
Sometimes you say I want X, but X is committed to another program and you 
cannot get X.  There is a lot of tuss ling that goes on so you can get the best 
people you can for your program.  That is normal.  That is up to the subsystem 
leads with a lot of help from central engineering to try and assemble as strong a 
technical team as you can. 
 MCO relied heavily on matrix organizations with t eams assembled from functional organizations.  
When the team for MCO was being assembled many  team members were still involved in other 
projects and continued to play advisory roles to t hose projects while attempting to work MCO full-
time.  The MIB stated that key team members were  added to the project too late in the process.  
Some of these key team members were not brought  to the project until just before launch; long 
after requirements had been established and hardware had been assembled.  Not only were key personnel added late but also, the MIB stated t hat MCO was understaffed throughout the project 
and key people did not transition between subsyste m phases.  Science teams were not prepared 
for mission operations supporting science data collect ion.  Some even believed that if MCO had 
entered into Martian orbit, the lack of involvement  of scientists from the beginning of the project 
would have resulted in insufficient data return.  Part icularly, scientists were not intimately involved 
in the project from its inception and were not  made full partners in the project development and 
operations. 
 
The project had a limited number of members with experience that could act as mentors for the 
inexperienced team members.  In addition, th is experience could have identified issues 
associated with many of the technical problem s with MCO.  The MIB identified the team’s 
inexperience as a key factor in the root cause of the MCO failure.  MCO was criticized for missing 
things because they did not have enough people to do peer reviews or take a second look at 
things.  With few people, team members never had time to think about anything but the task in 
front of them.  Hinners stated, 
 
You will not find this in the review board notes, the Lander Lead said to me when I was talking to him about the mission and how he felt, he said, ‘When looking 
back on it, our biggest problem was no A’Ha time.  We were so busy doing the 
work that had to get done, we did not hav e the luxury of just sitting back on a 
weekend or on when you got home at night  and just conjugating about what went 
on.’  When you get that time that th ings come together in your mind and 
something bothers you, and you say, ‘B oy, did we do that. I better go back and 
re-look that or there is something we need to work a little harder or take another 
look at.’  When you squeeze people so hard and it is all essential work, you loose 
that capability to exercise your mind and gi ve it a little relax-time when things pop 
into your head. 
 
 
Mars Climate Orbiter 19Responsibilities 
 
“You have formal organization arrangements and responsibilities and then there are the way 
things really work.”   - Noel Hinners, personal interview 
 
The MIB believed that roles and responsibilities were not clearly defined by project management 
with any mechanism for accountability.  In addition, management did not infuse a sense of 
responsibility in team members and make them feel  responsible for the mission’s success.  Most 
notably, the lines of accountability were faint.  With the lack of responsibility and accountability, 
came differences in opinion and project direction.  After the failure of MCO, one of the MIBs most 
difficult tasks was to determine accountability.  It was determined that the em ployees did not fully 
understand nor were trained properly on aspects of  subsystem/line organization interactions.  
This was distinctly clear in how major projec t responsibilities were delineated.  MCO project 
managers were responsible for development only, and a separate organization and project 
managers were responsible for operations after launch. 
 
Top Management Involvement 
 
Like most BFC projects, MCO had limited top m anagement involvement.  The key difference was 
that the lines of communication between pr oject management and top management were not 
clearly defined nor did either party aggressively pur sue interactions.  There was no single point of 
contact between levels of management; resulting in  multiple channels for information exchange.  
In addition, top management was not kept well info rmed as to the project risks.  John Mcnamee, 
JPL Project Manager, was described as buying the JPL support ‘by the drink.’  Because of a 
reduced budget, his linkage to top management was on a needed basis.  John was very cautious 
about signing up any external help because it cost  his budget.  So he tended to fend off the JPL 
engineering support.  This inadequacy in MCO resulted in the establishment of a new position at 
JPL to specifically monitor projects. 
 Standard, were monthly reviews with the Lockheed Martin management, monthly financial 
meetings, and extra reviews if the project was runni ng into cost problems.  For the Mars Surveyor 
Program this became all too common because of the cost pressures.  
 
Professional Advise and Reviews 
 
“JPL/NASA center policy and guidelines should be modified as necessary to emphasize the need 
to conduct, the value of, and the implementation of peer reviews.”  - NASA Lesson Learned Database Entry: 0929 
 
Traditionally at JPL, peer reviews and professional advice play a key role in project integration 
and success.  Peers are used to discuss the thr eats and progress of the project with an unbiased 
perspective.  People are selected that have ‘guru stat us’ of a long history of expertise in a specific 
area.  These people are brought together with the team and they work in an informal environment 
looking at the detail of the subsystem and the iss ues.  The results of these reviews are then rolled 
up into a presentation package for one of the majo r phase reviews.  Peer reviews are also used 
to evaluate the inheritance of a piece of equipment from another s pacecraft.  This allows for an 
understanding of the capabilities of t hat design or piece of equipment  to capture the requirement 
that it will face in the new environment.  In  MCO, peer reviews looked at the experience and 
inheritance from the Mars Global Surveyor, and how  that applied to MCO.  JPL believes that 
these help reduce the risk and get more  expertise on the issues at hand. 
 
Mars Climate Orbiter 20Yet, one of the key factors identified by many  of MCO’s team members was the lack of 
involvement of project scientist in critical dec isions throughout the project life cycle.  MCO 
reduced significant monetary and personnel resource s from the project that was allocated to 
support science objectives (key to measuring proj ect success). This reduction in resources had a 
direct result on the interaction of key scientist with critical decisions during the mission design and 
operation.  The MIB believed that proper repres entation by key personnel was not present at 
reviews.  Without these key personnel, MCO felt that  there was a lack of formality at many of the 
reviews and almost all of them lacked a deep penet ration of technical issues.  Most noticeable 
was the absence of discipline experts like softwar e navigation experts.  Even with the absence of 
key personnel at reviews, there was still lack of cross observation by subsystems.  For example, 
members of the navigation team  did not always attend the sy stems design reviews and vice 
versa. 
 
Organizational Problems 
 
“The experience on any of these projects depends on the level of team building and trust that can 
exist.”  
 - Ken Atkins, personal interview  
A MCO manager stated that an overestimate of the magnitude of the project brought conflict and 
tension throughout the project.  The MIB stated t hat a deficiency in the MCO project management 
was in their lack of reporting problems and insuffi cient follow-up.  Atki ns stated that someone 
could be working on a piece of equipment, and say to themselves, ‘Oh my goodness, I didn’t get 
enough money into this but it has a conflict going on.  I hate to put myself into a position that I did 
this wrong in terms of bidding the right size of this activity versus I should be open about this and 
go ahead and do this and let other people help me.’  Th is resulted in team members feeling they 
were not on top of their job in estimating the pr oject from the beginning, and ultimately leading to 
a position of denial.  Management did not give t eam members a sense of importance in reporting 
problems, and there was no means to allow team  members to report or resolve problems. 
 Discussions and conversation did not occur that a llowed for a consensus to declare that the 
organizational structure needed to change and that help was needed to carry a task out.  This 
apprehension was magnified by the fear of a specif ic position change, additional peer reviews, or 
support groups to guide the cognizant person to a successful conclusion.  In MCO there was a 
lack of openness and willingness of the personalitie s to accept outside help and organizational, 
structural change.  The failure of MCO resulted in problems in other projects, most notably the 
Mars Polar Lander.  At the time of MCO’s failure, MPL was already on its way to Mars.  The 
failure of MCO caused a crisis mode activity in  MPL.  Management was c onstantly asking, “Have 
we done everything that we should have done.”  Ulti mately this project failed when there was a 
premature shutdown of the descent engines and it crashed into the Martian surface.  Because 
MPL and MCO were integrated managerially, many of the implementation erro rs identified by the 
accident review boards were the same for MPL as they were for MCO. 
 
Training 
 
The MIB identified training as a key to the failure of  MCO.  They felt that  the navigation team was 
not familiar enough with the operations of the s pacecraft, and this lack of knowledge limited their 
ability to make informed decisions.  As inexper ienced team members were added to the project, 
they were not trained nor receiv ed any mentoring in what they were tasked.  This was most 
prevalent with the attitude control system.  Eu ler said additional training was necessary for MCO 
to meet cost constraints and relied on “one deep” personnel. 
 
Mars Climate Orbiter 21Processes  
 
In pre-project planning and determining require ments for the Mars’ 98 missions, the Mars 
Program Independent Assessment Team  (MPIAT) stated that there were inadequate resources to 
accomplish the requirements, and NASA Headquarters had applied pressure on JPL and LMA to 
be successful with the concern for loss of busine ss.  During the pre-project development process 
and during the project the pressure of meeting the cost and schedule goals resulted in increasing 
risk and knowingly cutting proven engineering practi ces to meet the cost and schedule demands.  
Project planning and engineering development cost for Mars’ 98, two missions, was half of that of 
Mars Pathfinder.  The planning process for MC O was adequate, because it showed that there 
were not enough resources or contingency to be successful.  Although the pressure to be 
successful was significant enough to proceed in conditions that were later termed “inadequate.” 
 
Project Phases and Reviews 
 MCO followed the standard NASA technical review  and approval process (i.e. PDR, CDR, SDR), 
but there were not adequate resources to support t he review processes.  Euler stated, “It was 
mandatory that we cut corners, primarily in  the review process and the quality engineering 
process. It was mandatory that we didn’t get a second set of eyes on everything we needed to.  
Otherwise we could have never met the cost goals. ”  As a result, these review processes were 
not rigorous and key experts in the field were not  sought to fill some of these positions on the 
reviews.  Some of the most recognized experts in deep space exploration are employed by JPL.  
The use of subject matter experts can validate requi rements to which a design is built.  This was 
not evident in the review of the small forces data, which later became mission critical.  The MIB 
contends that this internal expertise and capabilit y was not effectively utilized.  Additionally, the 
MIB stated that project phases di d not have clear transitions and team members were not sure 
when one phase had ended and another began.  Also contri buting to this dysfunctional transition 
was an inadequate transfer of informati on between phases.  Atkins stated, 
 
In the case of Mars 98 in trying to do tw o major and different flight systems with a 
very limited amount of money that made the depth that you could go with peer 
reviews not as deep as you would like to hav e done.  So that brings a little more 
risk into the issue.  For example, the nav igation.  If we might have had a little bit 
more of a peer review focus on the issue of small forces and how they applied in 
the navigation file transfer and so on, we probably would have been able to avoid 
the crash of MCO.’ 
 
Communications 
 
Communication for MCO between project elements was considered by most to be inadequate.  
There was a lack of early and constant involv ement of team members and the communication 
lines, as identified by the MIB, were not acti ve or open for real-time decision-making.  The 
contractor was remote from JPL (Lockheed Martin  in Denver, CO), and a significant amount of 
communication was through email.  In some cases critical decisions were made based on an assumption that the other person got the email, read it, and acted on it.  
 
Resource Management 
 
MCO fell into a transitional period of NASA’s defin ition of ‘better, faster, cheaper.’  NASA had a 
few recent successes and was beginning to define what they believed was ‘better, faster, 
cheaper’ in their guidelines for project managemen t.  Up until this point, through most of NASA 
history the culture was, if you run into a pr oblem, you can always go back to NASA and say, “I 
have a lot of problems” and more money would be pr ovided.  Over time and some visible failures, 
Mars Climate Orbiter 22these became viewed as overruns and people’s credi bility on cost estimations was in question.  
The glory of NASA’s prestigious past could not  carry the institution of NASA any longer.  
Therefore, MCO was under extreme pressure to  keep within budget, and thus performed extreme 
cost cutting in the projects development.  Eu ler stated that when he entered the project around 
Critical Design Review (CDR) they had exce ssive hardware development problems and extreme 
weight challenges, which meant a lot of new development.  This became very difficult on an 
already bare bones budget.  Euler described,   
John (Mcnamee) and I sort of mapped out a strategy to keep the costs down, 
and that was the challenge at that time during the better, faster, cheaper days.  
Don’t you dare go back to headquarters and ask for more money because you 
are not going to get it.  We worked out a st rategy that really was to make sure 
that we very carefully managed our resource s.  He was willing to spend all of his 
reserve to get us off.  Everything was out in the open on what we had left to 
spend, and we managed very carefully along those lines.  We had absolutely no profit to be gained on the program for the company, but I had strong company 
backing because this was important in getting us back into the Mars business.  
 Because of challenges like this, the idea of cost capped activities with the ‘better, faster, cheaper’ 
program required some additional help with regards to processes to make sure that these 
projects could be successful.  By the time MCO was started one of those processes began to 
move towards mandatory, and that was the ear ned value management system.  Earned value is 
based on a cost per task performance standard.  While MCO made a concerted effort to 
implement the earned value syst em, the system had to be tailored from the cumbersome and 
detailed earned value system adopted from the def ense department to something that could be 
done on a ‘better, faster, cheaper’ project.  MCO wa s able to implement t hat system using the 
experience Lockheed Martin had building defense proj ects and modifying it into something that 
could be used on ‘better, faster, cheaper’ acti vities.  This was fine for managing standard, 
planned resources, but MCO had difficulty wi th managing reserve, unplanned resources. 
 For MCO reserves were held and managed at as  a distribution through the depth of the 
management structure.  Each s ubset of work that was managed by a subsystem manager was 
performed based on agreements that were rolled up into a project agreement.  Once these 
agreements were established at the beginning of the project, the reserves were established 
throughout the project.  A subsystem manager  had no flexibility because they had already 
established their reserves.  MCO did not hold a set of uncommitted reserves at the project level, 
in addition to the initial set of reserves inside t he work agreement for use at the subsystem level.  
There was very little room for error at t he subsystem levels, and no room for unforeseen 
occurrences. 
 
Reducing Uncertainty 
 
“Mistakes are prevented by oversight, test, and independent analysis, which were deficient for 
MCO.” 
 - Mars Program Independent Assessment Team Summary Report  
MCO had a combination of cost, schedule, and tec hnical requirements that were unheard of in a 
new interplanetary mission.  To lower the tec hnological uncertainty for MCO, there was a heavy 
reliance on the inheritance of technology from the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft design.  MCO 
used many subsystems, computers, attitude cont rol, and propulsion technology from Mars Global 
Surveyor, but Euler stated that the dependence on these sy stems eventually became a 
contributing factor in the loss of the MCO.  Inheritance allows for a reduction in much of the time, 
cost, and uncertainty in development of technol ogy, but it does not reduce the uncertainty 
Mars Climate Orbiter 23associated with the integration of inheritance. MCO did not perfo rm adequate testing with all of 
the technology that was inherited from MG S.  In addition, MCO shared development and 
operations with MPL.  The MPIAT stated, “If efficiencies from shared development and operations 
are factored in, it appears that the Mars’ 98 proj ect was under funded by at least 30 percent.”  
Where there was very little inheritance from any  previous missions was in the navigational 
software, and the spacecraft configuration.  Eu ler stated that technical management accepted a 
“just like MGS” argument and did not focus on the det ails of the software.  The MPIAT stated that 
the navigation team was inadequately trained, did not understand the spacecraft, and did not 
pursue known anomalies.  One of the root causes of the MCO's failure as stated by the MIB was 
related to the modeling of spacecraft velocity  changes.  Inadequate verification and validation of 
the software contributed to an increase in uncertain ty and loss in performance.  Few actions were 
taken to understand the uncertainty of the software.   After MCO’s failure, various analysis were 
run that showed the high level of uncertainty related to the technology, specially with the 
navigation software.  This analysis indicates that an extensive testi ng program should have been 
implemented to integrate the navigation softwar e.  Unfortunately, budget constraints forced a 
reduction to the testing program.   
 
Without an understanding of the uncertainty, limit ed action was taken to reduce or address the 
uncertainty.  Testing was limited and end-to-end validation and verification was not conducted 
through simulations or testing.  The pressures of schedule and cost also led to some decisions 
not to retest critical systems or inadequate testing.  Hinners said, “If you are trying to do your best 
to ‘guarantee success,’ at least get as high as y ou can, you don’t squeeze test time.  Testing is 
critical to system integration,  and finding the inevitable problems and errors that are a part of the 
system.”  Euler stated that the full up tests that were run focu sed on crew certification and data 
path determination, and not flight produc t/process validation and data correctness. 
 
Systems Engineering 
 
“A very important lesson learned is to follow y our standard practices rigorously and think carefully 
about every decision and its potential impact on mi ssion success throughout t he life cycle of the 
project.” 
 - Ed Euler, et.al. (2001), pg. 655 
 
System engineering at the project level for a deep space mission occurs between the hardware 
systems (launch vehicle,  payload, navigation, flight), t he mission operation systems (tools, 
processes fly the spacecraft, return data back to Earth), and the product syst ems (attitude control, 
propulsion).  Once these are designed and tested, there is extensive in tegration testing and 
software developed to support the integration.  From  the integrating and testing at the subsystem 
level, the development moves up to the integrati on and testing at the system level.  Then once 
this is complete, the end product has to be tested in an operational phase.  The ultimate technical 
failure of MCO was attributed to the integrati on of the navigation syst em.  Some of the people 
working on the navigation syst em were working half time on MCO and half time on another 
project.  These people would be working the same type of subsystem for each project while the 
process that each project was using was different.  This was identified as causing confusion in 
the engineers, and resulted in engineers applying the wrong process to MCO.  For MCO this was 
very evident in the failure relative to the nav igation process that was applied based on the Mars 
Global Surveyor system, which was a symmetric al spacecraft, and applying that process without 
making adjustments or variation that are required to  do the asymmetrical spacecraft of the MCO.  
The MIB believed that there was strong evi dence that systems engi neering and the systems 
processes were inadequate on MCO.  The MIB felt  that there was a lack of communication and 
transition between phases and subsystem operations  with no one responsible for making sure 
these transitions occurred.  In addition, it wa s identified that followi ng basic standard company 
procedures, this error would not have been made. 
Mars Climate Orbiter 24 
Risk Management 
 
“I was looking for fault tree analysis, and I guess I was looking for risk management tools, but I do 
not recall seeing any evidence of them.” 
 - Peter Rutledge, personal interview 
 
In any project there are significant risks associ ated with schedule, cost, and technology.  Each of 
these risks has a margin of error associated with it and for most projects, all or any one of these 
factors will slip and the project still be cons idered successful.  For a deep space mission like 
MCO, the margin of error for any one of these fa ctors is almost zero.  With a fixed launch date 
due to celestial mechanics, the project schedule was fi xed.  With a fixed co st contract, the cost 
was fixed and any overruns meant cancellation.  With a given launch vehicle and competitively 
selected payloads, the technical requirements were  fixed and even slight changes would result in 
significant costs overruns.  With a budget for MCO and Mars Polar Lander equal to that of Mars 
Pathfinder, MCO’s margins were very small.  The MIB later stated that MCO was under-funded 
by 30 percent.  Ed Euler, et.al. (2001) stated, 
 
Many of the decisions made early in t he project were later criticized by the 
various failure review teams as too risky, but at the time, they were consistent 
with ‘FBC’ philosophy and reviewed and accepted by NASA review boards 
external to the project. 
 
The MIB stated that there was no identification of what was a cceptable risk, nor was there a 
process for determining mission-critical elements throughout the mission.  T he MIB identified that 
not only did MCO not perform adequate risk analysis before the project star ted, but also there 
was not a continual systems analysis throughout t he project to identify new or changing risks.  
One MIB member stated, “I was a little disappointed in what I observed that they did or did not do 
to try and anticipate what might go wrong.”  Standard methodologies for determining or 
questioning what might go wrong in a mission were not used (e.g. fault tree analysis, integration 
of the risk management with the earned value system).  When thr eatened with risk, actions such 
as support groups, addition or change of personnel to be more efficient, changing the scope, or 
pushing back the requirements were not aggressively  pursued.  Traditionally at JPL, there would 
be a Mission Assurance Manager, who would be responsible for identifying risk and inadequacies 
in systems integration.  They are responsible for ensuring project success or failure avoidance.  
This person was clearly identified as being in volved during the developm ent phase, but was not 
evidently involved in the operational phase of the project.  This inadequacy prompted NASA to 
require more involvement on the part of t he mission assurance people during the operational 
phase.   
 
A key tool for identifying and avoiding risk is te sting.  The MCO spacecraft was launched without 
an end-to-end testing to validate critical system s of the navigation syst em.  Some managers of 
MCO identified inadequate advanced planning, test ing, and verification of mission maneuvers 
and sequences. Peter Rutledge, Investigation Lead from the Office of Safety and Mission 
Assurance, stated, “I gue ss it really was not up to the usual  standards of what we would expect 
as far as documenting what the risks are and pr ioritizing them and estimating their probability and 
consequences.  I do not think that I saw that kind of formal approach to any  great extent on the 
project.”  
Customer Involvement 
 
MCO had three customers: NASA, the Scienc e Community, and the Public.  Any NASA funded 
project has itself as a customer.  This usually  is NASA Headquarters or the Program Office for 
Mars Climate Orbiter 25which the project is being funded.  For MCO it was the Mars Exploration Office at the Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory and the Space Science Ente rprise within NASA.  Other than John 
Mcnamee, JPL involvement was signi ficantly less than on previous programs.  In addition, one of 
the items that came out in the review proc ess was that the NASA Headquarters was much less 
knowledgeable and involved in the program than was ei ther desirable or historical.  This was a 
prime factor in leading NASA to establish a separ ate program office for the Mars program.  The 
review process found a lack of adequate partici pation by NASA in the whole process. 
 
The second customer was the scient ific community that the projec t supported.  As a scientific 
mission, MCO believed that its main customer  was the scientific community.  While MCO 
believed in listening to the scient ific community to determine its mission objectives, MCO involved 
this customer very little once the project started. 
 
With the storied success of Mars Pathfinder, the public was very aware of the Mars 98 missions 
and MCO.  Therefore, its failure was that much  more apparent to one of MCO’s customers, the 
public.  With the public, it is the scientific knowledge, the excitem ent and that sense of 
participation that can make a space mission a success.  
 
Contractor Involvement 
 
Linkages between the project and contractors were limited and faint.  This was most noticeable in 
the acquisition and oversight of  contracted software developmen t.  MCO identified a lack of 
control and effective processes for acquisition of contractor-developed, missi on critical software.  
The main technical failure of MCO, metric to English units, was a failure in the communication 
between the government and the contractor.  
Mars Climate Orbiter 26Tools  
 
For MCO there were no unique tools used to manage the project.  The one tool that was used by 
MCO, is used by many NASA space science projects, and unique to NASA is Earned Value 
Management (EVM). EVM is a standard NASA way of running planetary flight projects and 
performance metrics.  EVM is based on a set of  project tasks, and each task has a cost to 
complete and/or items to procure.  Each task and procurement has a schedule for completion, and as each one is completed a monetary credit is assigned.  These credits are then graphed 
against how much money has been spent thus fa r on the project to determine where project 
progress follows on the curve.  
 
Knowledge Management 
 
Decisions were made at very high level in the organization and information did not readily flow 
down through the organization.  The MIB belie ved that systems engi neers did no possess the 
skills to fully employ the subsystem engineers and thus the communication lines were weak and 
thin. 
 
Lessons Learned 
 
Traditionally JPL is known for there commitment  to lessons learned.  JPL has always been good 
at documenting and using lessons learned for its projects, and JPL uses lessons learned more 
than any NASA center.  As a result of the fa ilure, there are more documented lessons learned 
from MCO than most other projects within NASA.  But this was only the result of a failure that 
resources were allocated after the fact to document lessons learned.  One manager described 
the documenting of lessons learned as “very poorly  done across the board.”  If not for the failure, 
many of the lessons learned would have gone undoc umented.  Even with all of the lessons 
learned documented from MCO, Hinners describes some as “dead on arrival,” because are so 
specific that circumstance w ould never repeat again.  The c hallenge as Hinners described, was 
that, “An engineer would not sit down and go th rough a thousand lessons learned on a database, 
particularly in the heat of a project.  Second, there is no funding to do the job right.”  Hinners 
stated that on MCO and other projects there is  never funding to support capturing and utilizing 
lessons learned.  Lockheed Martin did not have fundi ng that they put a prio rity lessons learned.  
Hinners said that a lot of the lessons lear ned do not come during the development, but during 
operating a mission and the lessons learned proc ess ends before operations, which is when 
MCO failed. 
 
  
Mars Climate Orbiter 27Adapting Project Management to Project Type 
“There is a fine line between success and failure in these one-of-kind missions.” 
 - Ed Euler, et.al. (2001), pg. 655 
 Mars Climate Orbiter (MCO) was a strategic pr oject as NASA and JPL were beginning to build a 
sustained position in Mars exploration with rec ent successes of Mars Pathfinder and Mars Global 
Surveyor.  MCO would build upon those successes, and lay the groundwork for several planned Mars exploration missions over the next 15 years.  MCO fully understood the project’s 
implications and the impact of a successful proj ect.  The task outcome for MCO was a tangible 
product of a spacecraft, orbiter, and scientific inst ruments centered around an intellectual activity.  
MCO required a significant level of insight and creativity both technically and managerially, built 
around a core of talented, experienced people to produce a valued product, but cost constraints 
forced these requirements to be compromised.  MCO was two projects on a single project budget 
with extreme pressures from their internal cust omer.  The pressures of being successful in the 
new era of BFC directed MCO in making sure t hat there internal customer would be pleased, 
which resulted in compromising key issues and losing sight of the needs and communications 
with their external customer.  MCO lacked fram ework that could help understand the fit that is 
needed between the project management style and the pr oject risks.  It was forced to work under 
constraints that were impossible to achieve under  the combined requirements of ‘better, faster, 
cheaper’ and high project risk.   
 The NCTP Model below represents the analysis of MC O in respects to its Novelty, Complexity, 
Technology, and Pace.  Connecting the NCTP classification with a straight line to form a 
diamond, gives a representation of the level of risk associated with a project.  The greater the 
area of the diamond, the greater the degree of risk.  Also presented in the model, is how MCO 
differed in its level of risk and how the project assu med a lower level of risk.  While there is not a 
linear relationship between the area of the diamond for correct and incorrect project risk, it does 
represent a difference in the degree of risk.   
Mars Climate Orbiter 28 
  
Novelty :  MCO was a new-to-the-world product t hat developed a new use for a product that 
NASA had not seen before.  This defines MCO as a breakthrough project.  As the first in a series 
of Mars missions, MCO was to integrate some  mature technology into a new and untested 
spacecraft.  Although NASA had been successful with recent missions to Mars, not one successful mission had been repeated.  Each mission to Mars, even if using similar, proven 
technology from past missions, had some degree of unproven technology and was a new venture 
to the Red Planet.  MCO was no exception.  With only a few successful missions to Mars 
(Mariner, Viking I and II, Mars Global Surveyor, and Mars Pathfinder), there was still a lot to be 
learned about how to enter into Martian orbit.  Traveling to Mars still incorporated a lot of 
calculated risks, intuition, and trial and error.  MC O would require fast prototyping, late design 
freezes, and constant interacti ons with their customers. 
 
Unfortunately, the cost c onstraints of MCO forced MCO to be managed and designed as a 
platform project.  Using some proven technology  and the history of NASA and JPL’s successfully 
missions to Mars, the strategy on MCO was t hat of a new generation in an existing product 
family.  MCO had minimal technological success to build on.  While MCO used some of the proven technology from the Mars Observer and Mars Global Surveyor, only the Mars Global 
Surveyor had been successful.  Fast prototyp ing was compromised by inadequate testing and 
streamlined reviews.  For exam ple, the navigation software sy stem was the most novel and 
uncertain of all the systems on MCO, but rece ived no more testing or review than any other 
system.  In addition, the interaction with cu stomers was less than optimal and sometimes defined 
as “confusing.”  
 
Complexity :  As a very complex interaction of s ubsystems and elements performing multiple 
functions, MCO was a system project.  In additi on to its own complexity, MCO was designed to 
work with the Mars Polar Lander when it arrived at Mars.  MCO had multiple key customers from Derivative Platform Breakthrough

Mars Climate Orbiter 29industry, public, government, and the scientific community that were all vested in MCO’s 
development and success.  As a systems project MCO was a complex project that required 
extensive planning, computerized tools and software, hundreds or t housands of activities, tight 
and formal control, financial and schedule iss ues, reviews with customers and management, and 
extensive documentation. 
 
MCO was managed with its main contract under JPL and the Mars Surveyor ’98 office, and 
several smaller subcontracts to complete the dev elopment.  The control on MCO was formal with 
standard reviews, but not tight.  Management wo rked to empower the subsystem engineers so 
they did not play an integral role  in overseeing the project integr ation.  This was reflected in 
reviews, and control of technical, financial, and schedule issues.  A reduction in these areas as a 
result of cost constraints resulted in limited c ontrol of the subsystem integration and the absence 
of adequate end-to-end verification and validation thr ough reviews.  While much of the project 
was treated as a system, certain subsystems wi th high levels of uncertainty were managed as 
assembly projects (i.e. navigation).  Key people were balancing time with multiple projects, and 
working the same type of subsystem for each pr oject while the process that each project was 
using was different.  This was compounded by a lack of communication and transition between 
phases and subsystem operations.  Inheritance from past system s was assumed to reduce the 
uncertainty, but it did not reduce the uncertainty  of integration.  Key to any system is an 
understanding of the impact change and risk has on any  subsystem.  To treat any part of a 
system as an assembly is to treat the entire system as an assembly.   
 
Technology :  MCO was a high-tech project that used a mixture of existing and new technology.  
Much of the technology on MCO had been developed pr ior to the project’s inception and building 
an orbiter spacecraft was not new, but MCO was the first of its kind.  MCO required long periods 
of design, development, testing, and redesign with multiple design cycles that had to start before 
the project started.  With the ex tensive testing that was required for a high-tech project like MCO, 
in depth, technical reviews were mandatory to make  a project of this complexity successful.  In 
conjunction with these reviews, communication had to be frequent and active.  The complexity 
and communication demands required management to be of good technical skills and intimately involved in the project.  They also had to rec ognize the unique challenges of MCO and be flexible 
to extensive testing and design changes.  Ther efore, design freezes had to be scheduled and as 
late as possible.   
 
MCO more than any other project was under extr eme pressure to push the boundaries of BFC.  
These pressures, constraints, and challenges  limited MCO ability to fully recognize it 
technological challenges, thus MCO was managed mo re as a medium-tech project.  There was 
not enough testing, reviews, communication, or te chnical skills to manage a high-tech project.  
Because of budgetary constraints, many of thes e key elements to managing a high-tech project 
were reduced to meet cost and schedule, while some were just overlooked.  The dependence on 
inheritance systems (i.e. navigati on) eventually became a contributi ng factor in the MCO failure.  
While inheritance allowed for the reduction in ti me, cost, and uncertainty in development, it did 
not reduce the need for extensive testing and revi ew of the systems in tegration.  MCO was 
treated as a “just like MGS” spacecraft, and with a good framework to understanding of the 
uncertainty, limited action was take to reduce the ri sk.  Testing, verification, and validation were 
reduced, and sliding design freezes.  Becaus e of budgetary constraints, management left no 
room for error or the ability to be flexible to design changes.  In depth, technical reviews were 
streamlined and nominal.  Peer reviews had insuffici ent resources, could not aggressively seek 
experts in the field, and did not have peers as an integral part of the project.   
 Pace :  MCO was a blitz-critical project.  Time wa s critical for project success, and delays meant 
project failure.  The project team had to be spec ifically picked for MCO and they were considered 
a special group trying to achieve a rapid solution to  a vital project.  The MCO team truly felt the 
Mars Climate Orbiter 30pressure of MCO’s project schedule, sometime s working 100-hour weeks to stay on schedule.  
Procedures had to be shortened, made simple , and non-bureaucratic, while top management had 
to remain highly involved and constantly supportive.   
 
Success Factors 
MCO understood the impact of a successful missi on, and approached the project with a drive and 
commitment to be successful.  Management brought to  the project what they believed were the 
keys to being successful in a cost constrained env ironment.  Factors that may have contributed to 
MCO’s prospective success were: 
 
• Strategy 
o Customer defined objectives 
o Modest and attainable objectives 
o Clearly defined success dimensions 
o Competitive selection and underst anding of competitive advantage 
• Spirit 
o Focused, unspoken, common commitment to mission success 
o Team empowerment 
• Organization 
o Co-location 
o Limited involvement from top-management, but strong commitment 
 
Most space science missions are based on a cust omer-defined need.  MCO was no exception.  
The scientific community is always requesting more  data and they clearly articulate what they 
need.   MCO listened to this customer to define their project objectives, and like other successful 
BFC missions, kept the objectives modest and atta inable.  Defining project success on clearly 
defined objectives made sure that MCO understood what would classify it as successful, and 
there was no question by anyone on the project w hat constituted success.  By selecting 
Lockheed Martin as the lead contractor through a ve ry competitive review process, JPL was able 
to team with a proven company that clear ly understood their com petitive advantage.   
 
MCO’s spirit was described as unmatched by any  other project.  Team members were deeply 
rooted and devoted to MCO and its success.  There was a strong sense of ownership from every 
team member, and this made team empowerment  a natural and easy process for management.  
As an organization all key subsystems were co -located for MCO.  Even some JPL management 
relocated to Lockheed Martin for the project.  De cisions could be made real-time.  In conjunction 
with co-location, not having an aggressive in volvement from top management allowed MCO to 
move quickly on making key decisions and overcomi ng some obstacles in the decision process. 
 
Recommendations 
The MIB identified eight contribut ing factors for the cause of t he MCO failure.  Of these eight 
contributing factors, three dealt with the techni cal and five dealt with project management issues.  
Based on these eight contributing factors,  the MIB provided ten recommendations and 
observations, eight were management related and tw o were technical.  Even with the MIB’s 
extensive review, Ed Euler, Steve Jolly, and Lad Curtis stated, “The causes and corrective 
actions were well documented, however, these repor ts did not capture inner workings of the 
projects and the subtle things that happened that eventually led to the failures.” 
 
Recommendation 1 – Design to capabilities, not cost:  MCO as a standalone mission was a 
complex project.  Combined with MPL as one pr oject (Mars 98), MCO could not be considered a 
Mars Climate Orbiter 31small mission by anyone’s standards.  Unfort unately, NASA held Mars 98 to the same 
expectations as other successful, much smaller BFC missions.  With a budget that did not match 
the project’s complexity or size, MCO was designed to cost.  Management approached the 
project and all components with a cost constrained st rategy.  Cuts were made in areas that later 
proved to be key and contributed to MCO’s failure.  Because of cost constraints, peer reviews 
were de-emphasized, there was not an active in volvement from experts, dual development was 
used on subsystems for multiple missions, the number of people on the project was kept below 
minimum, and testing was streamlined in key ar eas.  Designing to capabilities may have revealed 
that this project could not have been done under the specified budget. 
 
Recommendation 2 – Understand the technical uncertainty to apply the right management 
approach:   With cost constraints creating more of  a reliance on past missions, a reliance on past 
systems created a false sense of confidence in the team’s ability to understand and integrate the 
subsystems.  Assumptions were made about how  systems from previous missions would 
integrate into MCO.  Some even defined this  as arrogance, which created blindness to the 
technical uncertainty of the sy stems and the level of testing. 
 
Recommendation 3 – Know the critical link in the subsystem integration:   There was not 
enough resources, contingency funds, expertise, testing,  or technical peer review with relation to 
the integration of subsystems and how the system will function from end to end.  Fundamental to 
general systems theory are four bas ic assumption: (1) the sum is greater than the parts and there 
are consequences for not understanding the dynamics of each part, (2) there is multi-lateral 
causality between subsystems, systems, and the environment they function in; (3) one set of 
initial conditions can give rise to different final states; and (4) there is concern with the flow of 
information between subsystems (components).1  The fact that a significant subsystem 
(navigation) and the integration of the subsystem carried a high level of uncertainty should have 
raised the level of awareness and concern of the technological uncertain and risk associated with 
the project. 
 
Recommendation 4 – Avoid overconfidence from past success:   NASA and JPL really 
believed they were hitting their stride with Mars exploration and BFC at the time of MCO.  They 
had a number of BFC successes and MCO was supposed to be the beginning of a series of Mars 
exploration missions.  NASA was confident that they could push BFC even father, but had not yet 
developed a clear understanding or framework of how and why those other projects were 
successful.  For example, the success of Mars Pathfinder was well documented, but how these 
success principles applied to other projects was not yet been well understood or studied. 
 
Recommendation 5 – Build a policy that supports the strategy and know its impact:   One of 
the characteristics of BFC was the ability to tailor, reduce, or create policy to help manage a 
project.  In order to alter policy, management has to clearly understand how that policy impacts 
the project.  Because of extreme pressures to  be successful under BFC, MCO reduced key policy 
directives that later had a key impact on the project. 
 
Recommendation 6 – Build a team with a mix of experience:   MCO was charted with 
accomplishing two projects with the budget of one and an organization the size of two. This 
limited MCO’s ability to attract and secure a good mix of experience and expertise across the 
project.  Repercussions of this were inexper ienced team members leading key subsystems, 
limited oversight from experienced team mem bers, and not enough advice from experts on some 
of the subsystems.

Mars Climate Orbiter 32Recommendation 7 – Build the project spirit, starting with a vision that will be exciting and 
inspiring, and build the project culture to support the vision:   No matter how high the spirit, it 
still needs to be managed.  MCO was described as very high spirited and committed to success.  
Management stated that motivating the team was t he least of their concerns.  By not managing 
the spirit and drive of the team , they ended up with too much of a good thing.  Team members 
worked themselves too hard, resulting in lack of  concentration at times, not enough time to think 
about the decisions they had made, and an extreme level of confidence.
