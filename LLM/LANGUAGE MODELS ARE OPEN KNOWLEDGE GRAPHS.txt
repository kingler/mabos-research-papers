ABSTRACT
This paper shows how to construct knowledge graphs (KGs) from pre-trained lan-
guage models (e.g., BERT, GPT-2/3), without human supervision. Popular KGs
(e.g, Wikidata, NELL) are built in either a supervised or semi-supervised manner,
requiring humans to create knowledge. Recent deep language models automat-
ically acquire knowledge from large-scale corpora via pre-training. The stored
knowledge has enabled the language models to improve downstream NLP tasks,
e.g., answering questions, and writing code and articles. In this paper, we propose
an unsupervised method to cast the knowledge contained within language models
into KGs. We show that KGs are constructed with a single forward pass of the pre-
trained language models (without ﬁne-tuning) over the corpora. We demonstrate
the quality of the constructed KGs by comparing to two KGs (Wikidata, TAC
KBP) created by humans. Our KGs also provide open factual knowledge that is
new in the existing KGs. Our code and KGs will be made publicly available.
1 I NTRODUCTION
Knowledge graphs (KGs) are an important resource for both humans and machines. Factual knowl-
edge in KGs is injected into AI applications to imitate important skills possessed by humans, e.g.,
reasoning and understanding. KG construction is mainly supervised, requiring humans to handwrite
every fact, such as Freebase (Bollacker et al., 2008) and Wikidata. KGs can also be constructed in a
semi-supervised way, in which a semi-automatic extractor is used to obtain the facts from web cor-
pora (e.g., NELL (Carlson et al., 2010) and Knowledge Vault (Dong et al., 2014)). Humans however
still need to interact with the extractor to improve the quality of the discovered facts. Therefore,
human supervision, which is often expensive, is required in constructing KGs.
Recent progress in language models (LMs), such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) and GPT-2/3 (Rad-
ford et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020), has led to superior results even outperforming humans in a
wide range of tasks, e.g., sentence classiﬁcation (Wang et al., 2018), question answering (Brown
et al., 2020). Pre-trained LMs are also capable to write poetry, music, and code, while such tasks
often require we human to spend a signiﬁcant amount of time in learning the relevant knowledge to
work well. In fact, these pre-trained LMs automatically acquire factual knowledge from large-scale
corpora (e.g., BookCorpus (Zhu et al., 2015), Common Crawl (Brown et al., 2020)) via pre-training.
The learned knowledge in pre-trained LMs is the key to the current success. We therefore consider
the following question: instead of using the manually created knowledge, can we use the knowledge
stored in pre-trained LMs to construct KGs?
In this paper, we design an unsupervised approach called M AMAthat successfully recovers the
factual knowledge stored in LMs to build KGs from scratch. M AMAconstructs a KG with a single
forward pass of a pre-trained LM (without ﬁne-tuning) over a textual corpus. As illustrated in
Figure 1, M AMAhas two stages: Match and Map. Match stage generates a set of candidate facts by
matching the facts in the textual corpus with the knowledge in the pre-trained LM. General or world
knowledge from large-scale corpora is embedded in the LM, thus candidate facts in the target corpus
are often covered by the knowledge in the LM. The candidate facts are matched through an efﬁcient
beam search in the attention weight matrices of the pre-trained LM without ﬁne-tuning. Map stage

Figure 1: Overview of the proposed approach M AMA. M AMAconstructs an open knowledge graph (KG)
with a single forward pass of the pre-trained language model (LM) (without ﬁne-tuning) over the corpus. Given
the input: a textual corpus containing passages and sentences, e.g., English Wikipedia, and a pre-trained LM,
e.g., BERT, GPT-2/3, M AMA(1) generates a set of candidate facts via matching the knowledge in the pre-
trained LM with facts in the textual corpus, e.g., a candidate fact (Dylan, is, songwriter) from the sentence
“Dylan is a songwriter.”, and (2) produces an open KG by mapping the matched candidate facts to both an
existing KG schema, e.g., (Bob Dylan.Q392, occupation.P106, Songwriter.Q753110) in Wikidata schema, and
an open schema, e.g., (Bob Dylan.Q392, sign, Albert Grossman.Q708584) .
produces an open KG via mapping the matched candidate facts from Match stage to both ﬁxed KG
schema and open schema. If the schema of candidate facts exists in the KG schema, we map the
candidate facts directly to the ﬁxed KG schema. Otherwise, we reserve the unmapped candidate
facts in the open schema. This results in a new type of KG, open KG , with a mixture of mapped
facts in ﬁxed KG schema and unmapped facts in the open schema.
Our contributions are as follows:
1. We show how to construct KGs from pre-trained LMs . The KGs are constructed with a
single forward pass of the pre-trained LMs without ﬁne-tuning over the textual corpora.
This helps researchers explicitly understand what the language models learn, bridging the
deep LM and KG communities through enhanced model transparency.
2. We propose an unsupervised two-stage approach, M AMA, to ﬁrst match the candidate facts
in the corpora with the knowledge stored in LMs, then map the matched candidate facts to
both ﬁxed and open schema to produce a KG.
3. We generate a new type of KG, namely open KG, consists of mapped facts in the ﬁxed KG
schema of existing KGs (Wikidata and TAC KBP) annotated by humans; and unmapped
facts in the open schema that are new in the reference KG schema. The reach of this result
is broad and has downstream utility for knowledge graph construction, deep neural network
interpretation, and information extraction.
2 M AMA
We introduce an unsupervised end-to-end approach Match and Map (M AMA) as illustrated in Fig-
ure 1 to construct open knowledge graphs (KGs) from language models (LMs). M AMAconstructs
the KGs with a single forward pass of the pre-trained LMs (without ﬁne-tuning) over the corpora.
The two stages of M AMAare:
Match generates a set of candidate facts from a textual corpus. LMs contain global or world knowl-
edge learned from large-scale corpora, which often does not perfectly match the knowledge in the
target corpus. The goal of this stage is to match the knowledge stored in pre-trained LMs with facts
in the corpus. Each fact is represented as a triplet (head, relation, tail)1, in short, (h; r; t ), and passed
to Map stage. Match procedure is detailed in Sec. 2.1.
Map produces an open KG using the matched candidate facts from Match stage. The constructed
open KG has two portions: (a) mapped candidate facts that are in a ﬁxed KG schema, e.g., (Dylan,
is, songwriter) is mapped to (Bob Dylan.Q392, occupation.P106, Songwriter.Q753110) according
to Wikidata schema; and (b) unmapped candidate facts that are in an open schema, e.g., a can-
didate fact (Dylan, signed, Albert Grossman) is partially mapped to (Bob Dylan.Q392, sign, Al-
bert Grossman.Q708584) in the open schema. This stage is described in Sec. 2.2.
1We use the term “head” and “tail” to denote head and tail’s “entities” or “entity mentions” for simplicity.

Figure 2: Illustration of Match stage. The upper part of (a) represents the general matching steps of generating
the best matched candidate fact (Dylan, is, songwriter) from the sentence “Dylan is a songwriter.” The lower
portion shows the corresponding step-by-step process. Given a head-tail pair (Dylan, songwriter) , at each
step, the search chooses one of the actions, i.e., START ,YIELD ,STOP to produce an intermediate candidate
fact. The search starts by adding the head “Dylan” as an initial candidate (step 0). The matching degree of
the candidate is initialized as 0. Next, a new candidate is yielded if the candidate has not reached the tail
“songwriter”, by appending the next largest attended token (with the largest score from the attention matrix (b)
of the sentence) to the end of the current candidate, and the corresponding matching degrees are increased by
the associated attention scores (step 1 and step 2). Otherwise, the search stops , and the candidate fact with the
best matching degree is returned for the head-tail pair (step 3). The attention matrix (b) is from the forward
pass of the LM without ﬁne-tuning over the sentence. “x” marks the tokens to prevent searching backward.
2.1 M ATCH
We frame the matching procedure as a search problem. To obtain the best matched candidate facts of
an input sentence, the candidates with the top matching degrees are returned from a search process.
The matching degree is derived from the search in the attention weight matrices of the pre-trained
LM, since the attention weight matrices are the container of the knowledge in the pre-trained LM.
The attention weight matrices are simply from the forward pass of the LM without ﬁne-tuning over
the sentence.
2.1.1 B EAM SEARCH
We design a simple-yet-effective beam search to ﬁnd the best matched candidate facts. For every
head-tail pair (h; t)in a sentence, the search maintains the k-best matched candidate facts of the
pair. Let’s ﬁrst consider the search from left to right with beam size equals to 1. An example search
process is shown in Figure 2. Given a head-tail pair (Dylan, songwriter) , at each step, the search
performs one of the following actions:
START the search from the head. The head his added as an initial candidate into the beam. For
simplicity, we use START (h)to denote the action, which returns a candidate (h;. In Fig-
ure 2(a), at step 0, the head “Dylan” is added as (Dylan, into the beam. The matching
degree is initialized to 0.
YIELD a new intermediate candidate in the beam if the current candidate has not reached the tail.
The next largest attended token (with the largest score from the attention matrix) is ap-
pended to the end of the current candidate to yield the new candidate. The corresponding
matching degrees are increased by the associated attention scores. At step 1 (orange arrow
in Figure 2(a)), “is” is appended to the current candidate to yield (Dylan, is, , since “is”
has the largest attention score with “Dylan” in the attention matrix. The attention score is
0.3 as highlighted in orange in Figure 2(b). The multi-head attention is reduced to a single
head so that every two tokens of the sentence are associated with one attention weight. We
experiment with different reduction setups in Sec. A.3. “x” marks the tokens (prior to the
current token) that are not considered in the search to prevent searching backward. Step 2
similarly takes YIELD action to produce (Dylan, is songwriter, . We use YIELD (c; s;As)
to denote the action, where cis a current candidate, srepresents the sentence, and Asis the

STOP the search step if the candidate has reached the tail, then add the candidate as a valid candidate
fact into the beam. As beam size equals to 1, (Dylan, is, songwriter) is the only returned
candidate fact for the given pair. We denote this step using STOP (c; t), which returns a
valid fact.
The details of the proposed beam search are in Algorithm 1. The inputs of the search algorithm are
a head-tail pair (h; t), a sentence s, an attention matrix Asofs. Both handtare identiﬁed by the
noun chunk in s.Asis the attention matrix associated with sfrom the forward pass of LM without
ﬁne-tuning. The search gets started by adding the head has the initial candidate in the beam (line
1). While there are still new candidates waiting to be yielded (line 2), the search continues, and the
topkcandidates sorted by the matching degrees are maintained (line 3-11) in the beam. In practice,
we implement an action manager Oto decide which action to take at each step. Given a candidate
cin the beam,O(c) =START always happens at the beginning of the search. If chas not reached
the tail tyet,O(c) =YIELD . Otherwise,O(c) =STOP . We also notice some facts are in reverse
order in the sentence, e.g., “ said Jason Forcier , a vice president at battery maker A123 Systems
Inc.” for facts of relation “org:top members employees”, thus enable bidirectionality by running the
algorithm in both directions (left to right and right to left). The beam search is implemented by the
breadth-ﬁrst search, which is efﬁcient as the time complexity is O(kd), where dis the maximum
depth of the search tree.
2.1.2 F ILTER
Although the basic functionality provided by beam search is sufﬁcient for ﬁnding useful candidate
facts, we have found a few constraints useful. Given a candidate fact (h; r; t )from beam search
resultT(h;t), it remains as a fact if satisfying all the following constraints.
Constraint #1 The matching degree of (h; r; t )is above a threshold. We compare the matching
degrees corpus-wide to only reserve the facts that are matched better with the knowledge in LMs. For
example, M AMAextracts a fact (Rolling Stone, wrote, pop song) from “Rolling Stone wrote: “No
other pop song has so thoroughly challenged artistic conventions””, which is not an accurate fact
based on the sentence. We observe the associated matching degree is below a proper threshold, while
the matching degrees of high-quality facts from the same documents, e.g., (Dylan, is, songwriter) ,
or conﬁdent facts from the other documents are beyond the threshold.
Constraint #2 The distinct frequency of ris above a threshold. To avoid facts to be over-speciﬁed,
e.g., (Dylan, signed to Sam Peckinpah’s ﬁlm, Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid) , we require rshould
take many distinct head-tail pairs in the corpus.
Constraint #3 Relation ris a contiguous sequence in the sentence. We can avoid rthat has no
meaningful interpretation (Fader et al., 2011), e.g., (Rolling Stone, wrote challenged, conventions)
from the above sentence.

2.2 M AP
The objective of Map stage is to generate an open KG. The open KG contains (a) mapped facts in
a KG schema (Sec. 2.2.1), e.g., Wikidata schema, if the schema of the candidate facts is within the
existing KG schema; and (b) unmapped facts from (a) in an open schema (Sec. 2.2.2).
2.2.1 M APPED FACTS IN KG S CHEMA
The goal is to map a candidate fact (h; r; t )to a fact (hk; rk; tk)in the KG schema. The reason for
mapping to an existing KG schema is to make use of the high-quality schema designed by experts
(to avoid duplicated efforts of building from scratch) and enable evaluating the candidate facts with
oracle KG facts contributed by human volunteers. We ﬁrst map both entities h; ttohk; tk, then map
the relation rtorkin the reference KG schema.
Entity linking to KG schema We leverage an unsupervised entity linker based on a mention-
to-entity dictionary (Spitkovsky & Chang, 2012) to link the entities for scalability consideration.
Besides, contextual information is crucial to link the entities correctly, we use the word embedding of
the context to disambiguate the entities, which means we only link the entities with high contextual
similarities based on the word embedding. We adopt the entity linker to map h; ttohk; tk.
Relation mapping with KG schema We largely follow the relation mapping method proposed by
Angeli et al. (2015) to construct an ofﬂine relation map between KG relation and relation phrases of
the candidate facts. The basic idea is that the more often linked head-tail pairs (i.e., entities are with
type information from the entity linking step) co-occur between the candidate facts and KG facts, the
more likely the corresponding relations are mapped to each other. In addition, we normalize each
relation phrase of the candidate facts by lemmatization, and removing inﬂection, auxiliary verbs,
adjectives, adverbs. After the relation mapping is constructed, one author manually checks whether
the top 15 relation phrases are true mappings for each KG relation. We only reserve the true ones in
the ﬁnal relation mapping. This process takes approximately one day. Later, ris mapped to rkwith
an efﬁcient look-up operation in the relation mapping.
2.2.2 U NMAPPED FACTS IN OPEN SCHEMA
An unmapped candidate fact (h; r; t )means at least one of h,r, and tis not mapped to the KG
schema based on the method in Sec. 2.2.1. There are two types of unmapped candidate facts:
Partially unmapped facts represent at least one of h,r, andtare mapped to the KG schema. It can
behortmapped to hkortkbased on the entity linker in Sec. 2.2.1. It can also be rthat mapped
torkusing the relation mapping in Sec. 2.2.1. This actually results in unmapped facts that are in a
mixture of the KG schema and the open schema. As the overall schema of the unmapped facts is
not in the KG schema, we use open schema to denote such unmapped facts in the rest of the paper
for simplicity. An example is (Dylan, signed, Albert Grossman) in Figure 1, where both head and
tail are linked to Wikidata schema based on the entity linker in Sec. 2.2.1, but the relation cannot be
mapped since there is no relation mapping from “signed” to a KG relation in Wikidata schema.
Completely unmapped facts indicate all h,r, andtare not mapped to the KG schema. This means
neither the entity linker nor the relation mapping is able to map h,r, andttohk,rk,tkrespectively.
The resulting unmapped candidate facts stay in the open schema, e.g., a candidate fact (Jacob, was,
A Registered Mennonite) stays the same in the open schema from a sentence “Jacob was a registered
Mennonite in Amsterdam.”.
The resulting open KG is a new type of KG that mixes the ﬁxed KG schema with the ﬂexible
open schema, suggesting new directions for the next generation of KGs. The open KG not only
contains existing knowledge in the reference KGs, but also extends the ﬁxed KG schema with an
additional open schema to improve the coverage of the KGs, that beneﬁts the downstream KG based
applications, e.g., QA and commonsense reasoning (Wang et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020).
3 E XPERIMENTS
How well can language models generate knowledge graphs? We experimentally explore how well
can M AMAanswer the question in the section. To measure the ability of LMs in generating KGs,
we directly measure the quality of resulting open KGs. The open KG (see an example in Figure 3)
contains two types of facts: mapped facts in the ﬁxed KG schema; and unmapped facts in the

open schema. We ﬁrst quantitatively evaluate M AMAby comparing the mapped facts to oracle
KGs annotated by humans in Sec. 3.1, then conduct an in-depth analysis of the unmapped facts in
Sec. 3.2.
3.1 R ESULTS ON MAPPED FACTS
We ﬁrst study the quality of the mapped facts. As the candidate facts have been mapped to the
schema of oracle KGs, we are able to quantitively compare the candidate facts with the oracle facts
in the reference KGs.
3.1.1 D ATASETS
We compare the mapped facts from M AMAwith the facts in two KGs:
TAC KBP TAC Knowledge Base Population (KBP) Slot Filling is a task to search a document
collection to ﬁll in the tail/object entity for predeﬁned relations (slots) for a given head/subject
entity in a reference KG. We experiment with the reference KG in the 2013 challenge. We use the
document collection and oracle facts of the 2013 task. The statistic of the dataset is shown in Table 1.
Wikidata We use popular Wikidata as another KG. We use all the oracle facts in Wikidata. We use
the English Wikipedia as the text corpus, since a large amount of facts in Wikidata is from English
Wikipedia. The statistic is in Table 1.
To evaluate the mapped facts, we ﬁrst use Match stage of M AMAto run over the corresponding
documents to generate the candidate facts. Then Map stage is leveraged to map the candidate facts
to the schema of TAC KBP and Wikidata respectively. The parameter settings, such as beam size in
Algorithm 1, are shared across TAC KBP and Wikidata based on the parameter study in Sec. A.3.
3.1.2 TAC KBP
To verify the ability to produce correct facts, we compare candidate facts from M AMAto the outputs
of two open information systems, which also produce triplets in the form of (h; r; t ).

Stanford OpenIE leverages POS tag and dependency parser, and generates self-contained clauses
from long sentences to extract the triplets, which is the best open information extraction system (An-
geli et al., 2015) on TAC KBP (Surdeanu, 2013). After collecting the triplets from the system, we
use the same Map procedure with M AMA(Sec. 2.2.1) to map the triplets to the corresponding KG
schema.
OpenIE 5.12is the successor to Ollie (Schmitz et al., 2012), and it improves extractions from
noun relations, numerical sentences, and conjunctive sentences depending on the linguistic patterns.
Similarly, the same Map procedure (Sec. 2.2.1) is leveraged to map the triplets from the system to
the KG schema.
We use two families of pre-trained LMs with M AMA. We use BERT BASE and BERT LARGE from
Devlin et al. (2018) with M AMA, namely MAMA-BERT BASE andMAMA-BERT LARGE . Be-
sides, GPT-2s from Radford et al. (2019) are used, i.e., MAMA-GPT-2 ,MAMA-GPT-2 MEDIUM ,
MAMA-GPT-2 LARGE , and MAMA-GPT-2 XL.
Table 2 shows the results on TAC KBP. We use the ofﬁcial scorer of TAC KBP Slot Filling 2013 to
evaluate precision, recall, and F1 on TAC KBP3.
MAMAconstructs improved KGs . From the results, we ﬁnd that all our methods achieve com-
petitive precision, which is greater than 60%, given the unsupervised nature of M AMA. All the
proposed methods outperform the two open IE systems. This shows that M AMAis able to produce
high-quality knowledge directly from pre-trained LMs by a single forward pass without human su-
pervision. The results show the effectiveness of M AMAin generating candidate facts from Match
stage, and producing high-quality KGs through Map stage. We also ﬁnd that M AMA-GPT-2 XLper-
forms the best. M AMA-GPT-2 XLoutperforms the previous state-of-the-art Stanford OpenIE by over
2.6% in F1. This shows the proposed end-to-end M AMAis able to recover the knowledge stored in
pre-trained LMs without relying on any extra linguistic features, such as POS tag and dependency
parser used in open IE systems. The main reason leading to the moderate results of OpenIE 5.1 is
that the system generates objects of the triplets with extraneous words, which hurt the performance
in slot ﬁlling tasks. Even though the proposed methods all outperform the two open IE systems in the
recall, however improving recall is clearly the future direction to further improve the performance
of M AMA. We ﬁnd that the main cause of the moderate recall is the incorrect entities caused by
spaCy noun chunk as summarized in Sec. A.2.
Larger/deeper LMs produce KGs of higher quality . BERT LARGE outperforms BERT BASE since
the doubling parameter size. GPT-2s share similar trends, where we observe performance increases
when the model size increases. This complies with our intuition on more knowledge is stored in
deeper and larger models. Such increases in performance seem subtle on TAC KBP, we ﬁnd this
might due to the relatively small number of oracle facts by noticing a more signiﬁcant improvement
on Wikidata in Sec. 3.1.3. We plan to further improve the results with larger pre-trained LMs, e.g.,
GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), Megatron-LM (Shoeybi et al., 2019).
BERT LMs outperform GPT-2 LMs under similar model sizes . More speciﬁcally, BERT BASE
performs better than M AMA-GPT-2 in F1, and M AMA-BERT LARGE outperforms M AMA-GPT-
2MEDIUM in F1. BERT BASE and M AMA-GPT-2 are similar in size, while M AMA-BERT LARGE
and M AMA-GPT-2 MEDIUM are similar in model size as well. This is mainly because that the
recall of BERT LMs is higher than that of corresponding GPT-2 LMs. The result indicates that the
Cloze-style loss function (i.e., masked language model) of BERT is more effective and ﬂexible in

recovering more knowledge than the autoregressive LM objective. We also notice that the precision
of GPT-2 LMs is higher than that of according BERT LMs. The reason is that the autoregressive
LM objective captures more accurate knowledge than Cloze-style loss does by not introducing extra
noise (e.g., masked tokens) during pre-training.
3.1.3 W IKIDATA
We select our best BERT based method M AMA-BERT LARGE , and GPT-2 based method M AMA-
GPT-2 XLon TAC KBP to compare with Stanford OpenIE (the best open IE system on TAC KBP)
for scalability experiments on Wikidata. We follow the same deﬁnition as the slot ﬁlling task to
calculate precision, recall, and F1 on Wikidata. Table 3 summarizes the results.
MAMAis scalable to larger corpora . Similar to the trends on TAC KBP, M AMA-GPT-2 XLper-
forms the best in precision, recall, and F1. The results show the effectiveness of M AMAin gen-
erating candidate facts and high-quality KGs. We also ﬁnd that M AMA-GPT-2 XLoutperforms
MAMA-BERT LARGE by over 1% in F1. This shows that the larger model (GPT-2 XLhas 5x more
parameters compared to BERT LARGE ) contains more knowledge, and M AMAis able to restore the
knowledge. When larger or deeper models (e.g., GPT-3) are used with M AMA, we can expect more
gains of the KG quality. Thanks to the efﬁcient nature of M AMA, which relies only on the forward
pass of the LMs without ﬁne-tuning, the results suggest that M AMAis scalable to large KGs.
Larger corpora embed more complete KGs . In particular, M AMA-GPT-2 XLoutperforms Stan-
ford OpenIE by 5.6% in F1. M AMA-BERT LARGE outperforms Stanford OpenIE by approximately
4.4% in F1. Both F1 gains are larger compared to that on TAC KBP. This is because that the LMs
contain world knowledge from pre-training corpora, e.g. Wikipedia and Common Crawl. The larger
the textual corpora are, the more knowledge our method is able to recover and match to the knowl-
edge stored in LMs. The ﬁnding is particularly important, since we are now able to construct larger
KGs of high quality from scratch when larger datasets are used, such as WebText2 and Common
Crawl (Raffel et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020). Similar to the observations on TAC KBP, the preci-
sion is higher compared to recall. Wikidata is not fully built from Wikipedia, M AMAcould improve
the recall by running on those larger corpora to collect more facts.
3.2 A NALYSIS OF UNMAPPED FACTS
As illustrated in Figure 3, the open KG constructed by M AMAis a new type of KG combining the
ﬁxed KG schema with the ﬂexible open schema. We turn to study the quality of the candidate facts
that are not mapped to the above reference KG schema, but are in the open schema generated by
MAMA. We manually judge such unmapped facts generated by our best method M AMA-GPT-2 XL
from 100 sampled documents in Wikidata and TAC KBP respectively.
The quality of unmapped facts is veriﬁed . We ﬁnd 35.3% of the unmapped facts are true on
Wikidata. We ﬁnd 83.2% of those true facts are partially unmapped facts as deﬁned in Sec. 2.2.2,
e.g., (Bob Dylan.Q392, tour with, the Grateful Dead.Q212533) , whose relation is not within the
schema of Wikidata, while both head and tail are in the schema. The remaining true facts are
completely unmapped facts (Sec. 2.2.2), e.g., a candidate fact (Jacob, was, A Registered Mennonite)
stays the same in the open schema.
Accurate entity detection is desired . We also notice 45.5% of the untrue unmapped facts on
Wikidata are due to the incorrect entities detected by the spaCy. Incorrect or missing entity linking
(to either head or tail) in Sec. 2.2.1 causes additional 9.1% errors in the unmapped facts. 4.5% of
the untrue unmapped facts are caused by the missing relation mapping in Sec. 2.2.1. The rest errors
made by M AMA-GPT-2 XLareincorrect relation phrases , such as uninformative relation phrases,
e.g., (Dylan, made, his breakthrough) , which is similar to the errors made by open IE systems (Fader
et al., 2011). Both entity linking and relation mapping of Map stage rely heavily on the accuracy
of entity detection from the spaCy noun chunk. We conclude that the main root cause of the untrue
unmapped facts is due to the errors made by the spaCy noun chunk.

We observe similar trends on TAC KBP. We plan to leverage crowdsourcing platforms, e.g., Me-
chanical Turk, to conduct quantitative evaluations over the unmapped facts to better understand the
strengths and shortage of M AMA. We plan to identify more accurate entities by relying on attention
weights in LMs (Clark et al., 2019; Hewitt & Manning, 2019) instead of using extra resources. We
will also investigate stronger entity linkers (Kolitsas et al., 2018) and learn a more robust relation
mapping through weak or distant supervision (Mintz et al., 2009; Ratner et al., 2017). We will in-
vestigate more sophisticated approaches, such as graph neural networks (Kipf & Welling, 2016), to
generate more accurate relation phrases from the attention weight matrices by considering structural
information.
4 R ELATED WORK
Knowledge graph construction can be generally categorized into two groups, 1) supervised ap-
proaches. Wikidata, Freebase (Bollacker et al., 2008), YAGO (Suchanek et al., 2007), YAGO2 (Hof-
fart et al., 2013), DBpedia (Auer et al., 2007) are built based on human supervision from Wikipedia
infoboxes and other structured data sources; 2) semi-supervised approaches. Open information ex-
traction systems, e.g., OLLIE (Schmitz et al., 2012), Reverb (Fader et al., 2011), Stanford Ope-
nIE (Angeli et al., 2015), and OpenIE 5.12aim to leverage carefully-designed patterns based
on linguistic features (e.g., dependencies and POS tags), to extract triplets from web corpora for
open schema KG. Besides, NELL (Carlson et al., 2010), DeepDive (Niu et al., 2012), Knowledge
Vault (Dong et al., 2014) extract information based on a ﬁxed schema or ontology, where humans
help improve the accuracy of the extractions. Probase (Wu et al., 2012) produces taxonomies instead
of rich typed relations in general KGs. M AMAinstead uses learned knowledge stored in pre-trained
LMs without human supervision to construct an open KG, which is a mixture of ﬁxed schema and
open schema.
Language models , e.g., BERT (Devlin et al., 2018), GPT (Radford et al., 2018), GPT-2/3 (Radford
et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020), ELMo (Peters et al., 2018), Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019),
ALBERT (Lan et al., 2019), RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019), XLNet (Yang et al., 2019) and Megatron-
LM (Shoeybi et al., 2019) contain factual knowledge obtained via pre-training on large-scale corpora
such as Wikipedia and BookCorpus (Zhu et al., 2015). Studies have leveraged the pre-trained LMs
as virtual KGs, and show reasonable performance in QA tasks (Dhingra et al., 2020; Guu et al.,
2020), and language modeling (Khandelwal et al., 2019). LMs are further enhanced by KGs (Zhang
et al., 2019; Peters et al., 2019) to improve knowledge-driven tasks. While the existing work utilizes
knowledge in an implicit way, the main difference is that our approach explicitly extracts knowl-
edgeable facts from the LMs. Compare to LAMA (Petroni et al., 2019; 2020), instead of conducting
fact recall in cloze statements, M AMAdirectly generates the whole fact in the form of a triplet
(h; r; t )from a sentence. Besides, the benchmark datasets used with M AMAare larger compared
to the LAMA benchmark, e.g., Wikidata is 3 orders of magnitude larger compared to the largest
dataset in the LAMA benchmark.
Neural network interpretation here speciﬁcally refers to pre-trained deep language model analysis.
There has been a lot of work to understand what the neural networks learn (Linzen et al., 2016; Adi
et al., 2016; Tenney et al., 2019). With regards to analyzing Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) based
language models (e.g., BERT and GPT-3), substantial recent work focuses on both visualizing and
analyzing the attention (Vig, 2019; Jain & Wallace, 2019; Clark et al., 2019; Michel et al., 2019; Vig
et al., 2020; Ramsauer et al., 2020; Hendrycks et al., 2020). Instead of analyzing or visualizing, we
use LMs to generate structured KGs to directly recover what LMs learn from the corpora.
5 C ONCLUSION
We show that the knowledge graphs can be constructed by a single forward pass of the language
models over textual corpora. We propose a two-stage unsupervised approach M AMAto ﬁrst match
the facts in the corpus with the internal knowledge of the language model, and then map the matched
facts to produce a knowledge graph. We demonstrate the quality of the resultant open knowledge
graphs by comparing to two knowledge graphs (Wikidata and TAC KBP). The open knowledge
graph also features new facts in the open schema, which could have broad implications for knowl-
edge graphs and their downstream applications. The results also suggest that larger language models
store richer knowledge than existing knowledge graphs, and generating on even larger high-quality
text corpora could continue improving knowledge graphs. Additionally, the knowledge graphs gen-
erated by our approach can help researchers to look into what the language models learn, so our
interpretable knowledge graphs establish a bridge between the deep learning and knowledge graph
communities.

A A DDITIONAL DETAILS AND ANALYSIS OF MAMA
A.1 I MPLEMENTATION DETAILS
To evaluate the mapped facts, we ﬁrst use Match stage of M AMAto run over the corresponding
documents to generate the candidate facts. For Map stage on TAC KBP, we link to the oracle an-
notation of the entities or spans in the TAC KBP corpus. On Wikidata, the entity linking method
described in Sec. 2.2.1 is ﬁrst leveraged to link entities in the candidate facts to Wikipedia anchors.
Then a Wikipedia anchor to the Wikidata item dictionary is used to further link the entities to Wiki-
data. If the head or tail is a pronoun, we further use neuralcoref4for coreference resolution. We use
GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014) embedding for disambiguation. The relation mapping is constructed
ofﬂine for TAC KBP and Wikidata respectively using the method in Sec. 2.2.1. For oracle facts in
Wikidata, we only preserve those facts describing relations that could be linked to a corresponding
Wikipedia anchor. We rule out facts of attributes about entities and facts of auxiliary relations (such
astopic’s main category.P901 ) and ﬁnally results in 27,368,562 oracle facts.
For Wikidata, at Match stage, we randomly split the English Wikipedia data into 20 partitions, and
map the data partitions to 20 distributed servers to run. Each server is conﬁgured with four Tesla K80
12Gs. We set the max sequence length to 256, and batch size as 32 for M AMA-BERT LARGE and
4 for M AMA-GPT-2 XL. We use implementations of pre-trained LMs in Transformers package5.
We use spaCy sentencizer6to segment the documents into sentences. M AMA-BERT LARGE takes
approximately 48 hours, and M AMA-GPT-2 XLcosts around 96 hours. The resulting candidate facts
of Match stage from the 20 servers are then reduced a data server, where a MongoDB database is
maintained to store the oracle Wikidata and entity linking results to enable the efﬁcient Map stage.
To produce the open KGs, Map stage takes around 18 hours. The setup is similar to TAC KBP.
Match stage is done within 48 hours for all the settings. The batch sizes of M AMA-BERT BASE ,
MAMA-GPT-2, M AMA-GPT-2 MEDIUM , MAMA-GPT-2 LARGE are 64, 32, 16, 8 respectively.
The parameter settings are shared across TAC KBP and Wikidata. All the choices are based on
the parameter study in Sec. A.3. The beam size of Algorithm 1 is set to 6. The matching degree
threshold of Constraint #1 (Sec. 2.1.2) is set to 0.005, and the number of distinct head-tail pairs of
Constraint #2 (Sec. 2.1.2) is set to 10. To generate the attention weight matrix Asof a sentence,
we reduce the weights of every attention head in the last layer of pre-trained LMs using the mean
operator.
A.2 E RROR ANALYSIS
There is still signiﬁcant room to improve M AMA. To further understand the shortage of M AMA,
we conduct an error analysis of the errors in precision (i.e., incorrect facts returned by M AMA) of
Table 2 and Table 3. We choose our best method M AMA-GPT-2 XLfor the study. We sample 100
documents from the Wikidata dataset, and manually check the reasons for the errors. We ﬁnd 33.1%
of the errors are caused by incorrect entities , while the relation phrases are correct. The errors are
due to the incorrect noun chunk detected by the spaCy7. 18.3% of the errors are due to the missing
relation mapping created in Sec. 2.2.1. Note that we ﬁnd approximately 23.8% of the errors are
actually correct facts that are new in the reference KGs . e.g., (Bob Dylan.Q392, residence.P551,
Nashville.Q23197) (in Figure 3) is not an existing fact in Wikidata, but it is a correct mapped fact
based on our annotation. The rest errors made by M AMA-GPT-2 XLareincorrect relation phrases ,
such as uninformative relation phrases. We ﬁnd similar errors are made by M AMA-GPT-2 XLon
TAC KBP. Similar to Sec. 3.2, enhancing the entity detection, entity linker, relation mapping, and
relation generation are helpful. We also plan to leverage lifelong learning (Carlson et al., 2010) to
add true facts to the reference KGs to improve the evaluation.

A.3 P ARAMETER STUDY
We study the effects of the parameters using M AMA-BERT BASE on TAC KBP. We randomly sample
20% of the oracle query entities as a hold-out dataset to tune the parameters, and use the best
parameter setting achieved for both TAC KBP and Wikidata experiments. When studying the effect
of a certain parameter, we keep the remaining parameters as default described in Sec. A.1. We use
F1 to measure the effects.
Effects of beam size Figure 4(a) illustrates the effects of various beam sizes in Algorithm 1. We
ﬁnd that in general, the larger the beam size is, the better F1 the setting achieves. This is because
that M AMAis able to reserve more potentially correct facts when more candidates are allowed in
the Match stage. However, F1 improvement gradually becomes subtle, while the computation costs
increase more signiﬁcantly. For sake of the efﬁciency, we do not explore larger beam sizes. We set
the beam size as 6.
Effects of search constraints Figure 4(b) compares the effect of different thresholds of the match-
ing degree of Constraint #1 in Sec. 2.1.2. We set the threshold as 0.005 since it achieves the best
result. Note that the summed attention score is normalized by the length of the fact to penalize the
cumbersome facts. Figure 4(c) shows the impact of the number of distinct head-tail pairs in iden-
tifying common relations of Constraint #2 in Sec. 2.1.2. The best result is achieved when it equals
10. This shows that while M AMAmostly identiﬁes frequent relations, it is also able to capture some
rare relations for the open schema.
Effects of attention weights Figure 4(d) shows the comparison between attention weights of the
last layer and the mean of all layers. The attention weights of the last layer perform better. This is
due to the attention weights in lower layers are low-level linguistic knowledge according to (Clark
et al., 2019; Ramsauer et al., 2020), which are less relevant to the factual knowledge for the KG
construction. Figure 4(e) compares the impact of different attention reduction, i.e., mean, max, over
the attention heads of the last layer. We ﬁnd the “mean” perform better. The reason is that the token
often intensively attends to several speciﬁc tokens in the sequence (Michel et al., 2019), and the
“mean” operator is more sensitive to such information.
