## Summary:
The paper "OlaGPT: Empowering LLMs With Human-like Problem-Solving Abilities" introduces a novel framework, OlaGPT, designed to enhance large language models (LLMs) by simulating human cognitive processes. It aims to bridge the gap between LLMs’ current capabilities and human reasoning abilities by incorporating cognitive modules such as attention, memory, reasoning, learning, and decision-making mechanisms. The framework also involves active learning, using a note-taking mechanism to improve model performance based on historical mistakes. Experimental results on multiple reasoning datasets show that OlaGPT outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks.
