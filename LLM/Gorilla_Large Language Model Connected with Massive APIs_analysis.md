## Summary:
The paper "Gorilla: Large Language Model Connected with Massive APIs" introduces Gorilla, a fine-tuned LLaMA-based large language model (LLM) designed to generate accurate API calls. The model outperforms GPT-4 in API call accuracy, reducing hallucination and better adapting to updates through its integration with a document retriever. The new comprehensive dataset, APIBench, and the self-instruct fine-tuning method demonstrate the potential to significantly enhance LLM’s capability to use external tools effectively. The implications suggest a shift towards LLMs efficiently interfacing with computing infrastructures and the web by accurately utilizing a wide range of APIs.
