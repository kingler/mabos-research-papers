Defining a Scenario (cont)
•They can describe:
–‘current/now’ or ‘as is’
and/or
–‘proposed/future’ or ‘what-if’ situations.
•Current is more about problem analysis
•Proposed is more about building a 
paper-based ‘prototype’ or 
representation

User Needs Analysis:
The core of any design scenario is a narrative 
around a user, trying to achieve a task goal 
involving a ‘thing’ within a given context or 
environment (e.g. the workplace).

SUNA Scenario
Over the next term she uses the case study to inform 
her own teaching, and from her experience of using it, 
she annotates it with her own notes <need to 
annotate>, and saves the annotated version and thus 
‘growing the context’. Indeed, she came to the stage 
of being so critical of the Case Study that she 
changed it by adding some of her own material <need 
to edit>. Eventually she decided it would be easier to 
create a new one <need to create> and submit it. 
Later on, she notices that the University QA officer 
had deleted the original Case Study <need to 
delete>, and hers was now offered as the best 
example of effective practice in that area.

Creating Use Cases
•A Use Case is defined as:
“a concrete description of activity that the user 
engages in when performing a specific task, 
description sufficiently detailed so that design 
implications can be inferred and reasoned 
about” (Carroll 1995).
•It  starts with a ‘functional need’ (e.g. 
Withdraw cash from the ATM) but describes 
the ‘how’ (place card in slot; type in PIN; 
select service………)

Rosson’s & Carroll’s (2002): 
Scenario-based Usability Engineering
SUNA
A strong 
emphasis on 
usability
www.chimera.uk.com
Problem Scenarios
•Descriptions of the current situation
•Used to identify ‘claims’ and ‘trade-offs’ that 
may impact usability
•A problem claim is about the positive and 
negative effects of features on the actor’s 
experience
•E.g. Situation Feature – Students can email 
their tutors
–Pos. offers timely and effective support
–Neg. takes up too much of the teacher’s time
-Trade-off: Teachers will only respond to emails 
about specific assignments (a need?)
www.chimera.uk.com
Activity Scenarios
•Transform current activities to use new design 
ideas (proposed scenario) or new functionality
•Inputs:
–Problem claims/trade-offs (keep the best 
features!)
–New technologies, metaphors or design ideas 
(from brainstorming)
–HCI knowledge
–Current practice knowledge
•Output:
–Design Claims (new design features & their 
implications (SUNA Needs?)
www.chimera.uk.com
Information Scenarios
•Making sense of how users perceive, 
interpret and make sense of information
•Elaborate activities so that they include 
perceptual & presentation details. 
Information Design Scenario
“The email includes a string 
that Delia recognises as a URL 
in…….”Activity Design Scenario
“When Delia shows Alicia 
an email invitation to the 
VSF, the two of them 
decide to follow the link 
right then…”
•Would a template (e.g. object name;  
representation; required action; flow….)  rather 
than a Scenario be a more effective 
representation?
www.chimera.uk.com
Interaction scenarios
•These are about “physical actions and 
system responses that enact and 
respond to the users’ task goals and 
needs”.
•A use case?
www.chimera.uk.com
SUNA v’s Scenario-based 
Usability Engineering
•SUNA has no ‘problem scenarios’ such 
information is owned & shared by 
experts
•SUNA’s Scenarios & SBUE’s Activity 
Scenarios are similar 
•Many of SUNA’s scenarios also cover 
‘Information’ and ‘Interaction’ scenarios
www.chimera.uk.com
The e-framework…?
Requires all the pieces to fit together as seamlessly 
and effortlessly as possible, including, for example:
•Open Standards
•Common terms/definitions
•Agreed framework/process
•Open APIs or source code
Or a common design/development/deployment 
approach  – UIDM? Agile? UML? RAD? ANT? 
MAVEN?

Issue 1: Where do scenarios 
come from?
1.Information gathered  –
templates, marketing docs; 
previous products…
2.An Individual (beware of design 
bullies!!!)
3.Expert group (SUNA - proposed 
only scenario or USTM – now & 
proposed descriptions
4.Combinations of the above
www.chimera.uk.com
Issue 2: One Scenario or Many?
•SUNA can generate a number of 
scenarios but all at the same level – no 
concept of a ‘super scenario’.
•SBUE creates many scenarios at many 
levels – too many?  Perhaps only 
problem and activity scenarios are ‘true’
scenarios.
www.chimera.uk.com
Issue 3: Non-functional Needs?
•Needs are what people want the system 
to do.
•Tasks = functional needs
•Many Non-functional needs e.g.
–training 
–usability
–acceptability (organisational/social issues)
Cannot be derived from a HTA nor from 
SUNA approach; 
www.chimera.uk.com
Non-functional needs?
•These are about change – so you need 
a baseline (a current description or 
scenario).
•So SBUE is better (problem compared 
to activity scenarios).
www.chimera.uk.com
USTM Approach to Change
www.chimera.uk.com
Issue 4: How valid are 
Scenarios?
To be valid, they should be:
•Grounded (based on good, valid and trusted 
back ground information)
•Realistic (evaluate them with users)
•Consistent (same conditions should generate 
similar scenarios)
•Coherent and complete
•Useful (interface with existing design methods)
•Economical (in time and money)
www.chimera.uk.com
Conclusions
•Need for clearer definitions
•Need to know ‘how many’
•Need to combine SUNA,
SBUE and USTM to create
a more complete approach (inc non-
functional needs; technical 
manuals…)
•Must be linked into existing 
design methods 
•Art, Craft or Science?
