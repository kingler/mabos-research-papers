Abstract
In order to enhance the business process, the Bid Process Information System (BPIS) should be made more performant by ensur-
ing greater ﬂexibility and interoperability between devices. Moreover, the specication of this system has to deal with “three ﬁt”problems. To this end, four dimensions have been identiﬁed in order to cope with potential failures: operational, organizational,
decision-making, and cooperative dimensions. In this paper, we focus on the decision-making dimension of the BPIS and propose
an approach for representing data warehouse schema based on an ontology that captures the multidimensional bid-knowledge.

The bid process which corresponds to the conceptual phase of the lifecycle of a product is a particular environment
for the exploitation of business process [8]. It interacts upstream and involves other processes being design process. It
aims to examine the feasibility of the bid before negotiating any contract with any owner following a pre-study carried
out before a project launch.
The IS (Information System) [7] that allows to run the bid process (Bid Process Information System or BPIS) must
be [20][ 19]: integrated, ﬂexible and interoperable. Nevertheless, the enterprise architecture approach [7], on which
we rely to implement this system, has to deal with “three ﬁt” problems: vertical, horizontal and transversal ﬁt (Fig.

2. Resolution of the “three ﬁt” problems: BPIS integrated, ﬂexible and interoperable
We have identiﬁed four dimensions to deal with “three ﬁt” problems [20],[19]:
•the operational dimension that serves to specify the bid exploitation process by undertaking a speciﬁc project;
•the organizational dimension which allow the management and saving of the set of skills and knowledge that
the company acquired in previous bid auctions;
•the decision-making dimension which aims at optimizing the right decision-making by the company in bid
auctions; and

Fig. 2: The Bid Process Information System (BPIS) [20].
•the cooperative dimension which aims at ensuring intra-entreprise communication (internal interoperability)
and at planning the inter-entreprise communication on demand, in order to achieve a common goal (dynamic
interoperability).
We suggest fulﬁlling these dimensions while relying on the following hypothesis [20],[19] such as shown in Figure
2. The ERP (Enterprise Resources Planning) aims at build the techno-economic proposal of an oﬀer in order to
cover the operational dimension. In addition, the organizational memory covers the organizational dimension [10].
Moreover, a data warehouse will evaluate a set of solutions that make this proposal operational [16] to cover thedecision-making dimension[20].
3. Related Work: Extending Multidimensional Ontology
In data warehouse design, diﬀerent modeling techniques are used to represent the multidimensional concepts ex-
tracted from data sources, as well as the sources themselves. It can be ER diagram, UML diagram or graphs [8],
etc. Unlike ontologies, which are ready for computing, these techniques are conceptual formalizations intended to
graphically represent the domain and not used for querying and reasoning. This work is a continuation to a previ-
ous research [8], [22] and it aims at integrating ontologies in the data warehouse design process [13]. Therefore, the
starting point was the meta-model of data warehouse scheme [22]. The multidimensional ontology [21] is a represen-
tation of knowledge dedicated to decision-making dimension [20], [19]. It speciﬁes the multidimensional conceptsand their semantic and multidimensional relations[14]. Its use covers diﬀerent steps of the data warehouse lifecycle.During these steps, it assists the designer to solve problems of data sources heterogeneity. In the OLAP requirement
speciﬁcation step, the decisional ontology helps to validate the multidimensional concepts (fact, measure, dimension,
etc.) and relations between these concepts. It, also prevents associations between concepts not semantically associable
(e.g. associating fact-to-fact, dimension-to-dimension, hierarchy-to-fact, etc.). Various approaches were proposed to
guide creating ontologies [1][ 6], we mainly based the multidimensional ontology construction process on the ap-
proach proposed in [3]. While other techniques (mentioned above) for representing multidimensional knowledge are
an appropriate choice for their respective approaches, their use ends when the task of designing the data warehouse is
accomplished. On the other hand, the multidimensional ontology can still be useful. It can cover the various phasesManel Zekri /Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000–000
of the life cycle of a decision-making dimension [20], [19] , that is to say, from the requirements speciﬁcation, thedesign of data warehouse and data marts [4], until the exploitation and evolution phases. This is convenient becausethe recent DBMSs allow storing ontologies alongside data in the same database structure [2]. Such database is calledOBDB (ontology-based database). Ontologies are scalable and extendable, and they showed their eﬀectiveness for ISand requirements speciﬁcation [3]. More concretely and in the same way, as ontologies are used for clarifying thesemantics of data sources, they are used to identify and manage semantic conﬂicts between concepts. This allows us
to add as many extensions as needed to the multidimensional ontology to cover the various phases of the life cycle of
a decision-making dimension [20], [19] . To demonstrate this aspect, we have proposed an extension that representsthe operational data source conceptual schema, in this case, an ER diagram [22].
4. The data warehouse lifecycle: ontology-based method for data modeling schema
In this section, we will present an overview of the ﬁrst phase of the approach which we adopted. It is progressive
and iterative. The assistance of the designer throughout this construction is optional. The approach can be executed
autonomously, but the intervening of a designer during validation steps is recommended and will result in better
output.
A domain ontology contains knowledge that is a semantic representation of the multidimensional concepts. This
representation is often complete because of its generality. Hence, multidimensional concepts which could be usefulfor the decision-makers will be contained in the domain ontology. We design the steps of the data warehouse lifecyclewhich is an ontology-based method for data modeling schema in Figure 3.
4.1. Multidimensional Relationships
After deﬁning the concepts of the multidimensional ontology, we need to specify the relationships that exist be-
tween them. Each relationship is of the form Relation (X, Y), where Relation is a binary predicate, and X and Y are
concepts. We deﬁne the relationships described below through the schema given in Figure 4.
Both multidimensional concepts and relationships are presented in the bellow:
•IsFact ID (FID, F) where Fact ID (FID), Fact (F) and FID is the Id of F.
•IsMeasure (M,F) where Measure (M ), Fact (F) and Mis a Measure of F.
•IsDimension (D, F) where Dimension (D), Fact (F) and Dis a Dimension of F.
•IsDimension ID (DID, D) where Dimension ID (DID), Dimension (D) and DID is the Id of D.
•IsHierarchy (H, D) where Hierarchy (H ), Dimension (D) and His a Hierarchy of D.
•IsLevel (L,H ) where Level (L), Hierarchy (H ) and Lis a level of H.
•IsAttribute (A, L) where Attribute (A), Level (L) and Ais an Attribute of L.
•IsFiner Than (Li, Lj ) where Level (Li), Level (Lj ),LiandLjare from the same Hierarchy and Lihas a ﬁner
granularity that Lj.
With the aim of ensuring the availability of data, we consider the data sources that are represented in a conceptual
data model for the production base. In the next step, we extract the multidimensional concepts. It is divided into three
stages that are repeated for each multidimensional concept. Thus, we determine a set of potential multidimensional,using extraction rules.
4.2. Fact extraction
Facts describe the daily activities of the bid companies. These activities result in transactions and produce trans-
action objects. A transaction object is an entity registering the details of an event such as the payment of the bid
proposition, etc. These entities are the most interesting for the data warehouse and are the basis for the construction
of the fact tables. However, they are not all important. Thus, we must choose those that have an interest in the deci-sion making. Usually a transaction object is a complex object containing multiple pieces of information. Therefore

•the cooperative dimension which aims at ensuring intra-entreprise communication (internal interoperability)
and at planning the inter-entreprise communication on demand, in order to achieve a common goal (dynamic

We suggest fulﬁlling these dimensions while relying on the following hypothesis [20],[19] such as shown in Figure
2. The ERP (Enterprise Resources Planning) aims at build the techno-economic proposal of an oﬀer in order to
cover the operational dimension. In addition, the organizational memory covers the organizational dimension [10].
Moreover, a data warehouse will evaluate a set of solutions that make this proposal operational [16] to cover thedecision-making dimension[20].

A domain ontology contains knowledge that is a semantic representation of the multidimensional concepts. This

its modeling requires its decomposition into associated sub-objects. In the ER model, a transaction object may be
represented in one of two forms:
•An entity connected to an association;
•Two entities linked by an association
In order to determine “Fp” (set of potential facts), we deﬁne the following heuristic:
HF: All transaction objects are potential facts. For each identiﬁed transaction object identiﬁed, we associate a moredescriptive name, which will be the name of the fact. These facts are necessarily all pertinent, thus a validation phase
where the designer may intervene is essential to retain a subset of valid facts (Fv).

4.3. Measure extraction
As we previously stated, a transaction object is the result of the bid companies activities. Accordingly, the attributes
may be measurements of a fact that are encapsulated in the transaction object. The following heuristics determine the
potential measures:Hm1:M p( fv) contains the non-key numeric attributes belonging to the transaction object representing “fv”.
Hm2: If the attribute is a Boolean, we add to Mp (fv) the number of instances corresponding to the valuesTrue andFalse of this attribute.
•Fv: a valid fact from the previous step;
•Mp (fv): the set of potential measures of “fv”;
•Mv (fv): the set of measures of “fv” approved by the designer, which is a subset of “Mp (fv)”.
The extraction of measures is also followed by a validation step by the designer in order to determine Mv (fv)
which elements satisfy the following assertion:

its modeling requires its decomposition into associated sub-objects. In the ER model, a transaction object may be
represented in one of two forms:
•An entity connected to an association;
•Two entities linked by an association
In order to determine “Fp” (set of potential facts), we deﬁne the following heuristic:
HF: All transaction objects are potential facts. For each identiﬁed transaction object identiﬁed, we associate a moredescriptive name, which will be the name of the fact. These facts are necessarily all pertinent, thus a validation phase
where the designer may intervene is essential to retain a subset of valid facts (Fv).

4.3. Measure extraction
As we previously stated, a transaction object is the result of the bid companies activities. Accordingly, the attributes
may be measurements of a fact that are encapsulated in the transaction object. The following heuristics determine the
potential measures:Hm1:M p( fv) contains the non-key numeric attributes belonging to the transaction object representing “fv”.
Hm2: If the attribute is a Boolean, we add to Mp (fv) the number of instances corresponding to the valuesTrue andFalse of this attribute.
•Fv: a valid fact from the previous step;
•Mp (fv): the set of potential measures of “fv”;
•Mv (fv): the set of measures of “fv” approved by the designer, which is a subset of “Mp (fv)”.
The extraction of measures is also followed by a validation step by the designer in order to determine Mv (fv)
which elements satisfy the following assertion:

Manel Zekri /Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000–000
∀fv∈Fv,∀m∈Mv(fv)→Ismeasure (m,fv) (1)
4.4. Decision extraction
Extraction of dimensions is based on a second type of object called base object. A base object determines the
details of an event by answering the questions “who”, “what”, “when”, “where” and “how” related to a transaction
object. For example, the Bid Project event is deﬁned by several components such as (Owner: who bought) and (Bid
Proposition: we sold what). A base object completes the meaning of the event represented by a transaction object thus
providing additional details. Each object corresponding to one of these questions, and directly or indirectly linked
to a transaction object is a potential dimension for the fact representing the transaction object. The extraction ofdimensions consists of determining the name, IDand hierarchy(s) through these heuristics:
Hd1: Any base object directly or indirectly connected to the transaction object of “fv)” is a potential dimension of
“fv”.
Hd2: All IDsof a base object obtained by Hd1 is an “id ”o f“ d”.
•Dp (fv): the set of potential dimensions of “fv”;
•Dv (fv): the set of valid dimensions of “fv”; which is a subset of “Dp (fv)”;
•d:adimension;
•idd: the “id ” of a dimension “d ”,
The validation step produces two subsets Dv(fv) and IDDv (fv), satisfying the following assertion:
∀fv∈Fv,∀d∈Dv(fv),∃dimension id(did)
→Isdimension (d,fv)∧Isdimension (idd ,d)(2)
4.5. Attributes extraction
We deﬁne the following heuristics to determine the potential attributes:
Ha1: Any attribute belonging to the base object containing “idd ” is a potential attribute of “d ”.
Ha2: Any attributes belonging to a base object that generated a valid dimension “dv” is a potential attribute of “dv”.The validation step produces a set of valid attributes “Av ”, satisfying the following assertion:
∀av∈Av(dv)→Isattribute (av,dv) (3)
Each extracted element becomes an individual (i.e. instance) of the concept that represents its role.
5. The utility of applying this approach in the knowledge of the bid process
Working on a speciﬁc bid implies the intervention of several collaborators. Certainly, these contributors exchange
knowledge and information ﬂows. However, its environmental diﬀerences lead to various representations and inter-pretations of knowledge (“horizontal ﬁt” problems). Such failures are described in terms of ﬁve conﬂicts: the syntacticManel Zekri /Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000–000
conﬂicts are the results of diﬀerent terminologies used by stakeholders on the same domain. The structural conﬂictsare related to diﬀerent levels of abstraction which aim at classifying knowledge within a virtual company (bid staﬀ).The semantic conﬂicts concern the ambiguity that emerges due to the stakeholders reasoning in the development ofthe techno-economic proposal. Heterogeneities conﬂicts are due to the diversity of data sources. The contextual con-ﬂicts are mainly from environmental scalability problems. Thus, stakeholders can evolve in di ﬀerent environments. In
this context, we can deduce that the multidimensional schemas permit to overcome the “horizontal ﬁt” problems with
these various conﬂicts and manage the knowledge of bid process.
6. Conclusion and Perspectives
In this work, we tried to deﬁne the characteristics of the decision-making dimension of the BPIS. Thus, we have pre-
sented an approach for representing data warehouse schema based on an ontology that captures the multidimensional
knowledge. We discussed one possible for extending the multidimensional ontology to eventually cover diﬀerent
phases of the data warehouse life cycle. We focused on the design phase, and showed how the use of the multidi-
mensional ontology combined with an extension can be beneﬁcial. In the future we intend to continue to explore
the possibility of extending ontologies by considering bid ontologies as extensions that could be used to improve theresulting data warehouse schema; in addition to real cases of the implementation of the approach.
