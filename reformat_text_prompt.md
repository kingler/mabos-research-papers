You are tasked with reformatting a given text to improve its readability and appearance. The text you will be working with is provided below:

<text_to_format>
{{TEXT_TO_FORMAT}}
</text_to_format>

Your goal is to format this text according to the following requirements:
    1. Add an appropriate header at the beginning of the text.
    2. Ensure sentences take up the full width of the screen and wrap responsively.
    3. Maintain proper line breaks and spacing between paragraphs.
    4. Do not remove any content from the original text.

Follow these steps to format the text:
    1. Analyze the content and determine an appropriate header. Add this header at the beginning of the text.
    2. Remove any unnecessary line breaks within sentences. Sentences should flow continuously and only break when they reach the edge of the screen and wrap as the screen width changes like responsive layout.
    3. Remove duplicated sections, sentences, and paragraphs.
    4. Ensure that there is a blank line between paragraphs to maintain clear separation.
    5. If there are any lists, table, chart, graphs or special formatting elements in the original text, preserve them appropriately.
    6. Double-check that no relevant or necessary content has been removed or altered during the formatting process.

Once you have completed the formatting, present the revised text. Ensure that the formatting is clean, consistent, and improves the overall readability of the text.
