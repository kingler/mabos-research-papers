- [A Design Framework for Generating BDI Agents from Goal Models.pdf](a_design_framework_for_generating_bdi_agents_from_goal_models.pdf) 

  **Abstract**

  We define a tool-supported design framework that allows to specify an agent goal model and to automatically generate fragments of a BDI agent from it. We devise the design process as a transforma- tion process from platform-independent design models to platform- specific models and then to code. The design framework is demon- strated by referring to the *Tropos* methodology and to the JADE/Jadex platform. In this short paper, key steps in the process are illustrated through an example.

  **Abstract**

  In a Smart City context, and specifically targeting public collection of sensor data from arbitrary sources by arbitrary actors, accuracy, reliability and frequency of data may be highly variable. The Blockchain technology allows the management of public immutable ledgers that track the activities of these actors closely and, as such, provides a possible solution to incentivize and empower good actors (those who supply accurate, reliable and frequent data). This paper focuses on mechanisms to provide such incentives, what we call a Proof- of-Confidence (POC), using a view of these actors as intelligent agents, capable of autonomous interaction with the Blockchain. While it is concluded that full security guarantees can not be provided without additional restrictions at the agents’ behavior level, our model is used to prove the feasibility of supplying a gamified environment for such agents, with optimizable metrics which favor accurate, reliable and frequent data.

  

- [A Multi-Agent Approach to Professional Software Engineering.pdf](a_multi-agent_approach_to_professional_software_engineering.pdf) 

  **Abstract**

  The community of agent researchers and engineers has pro- duced a number of interesting and mature results. However, agent tech- nology is still not widely adopted by industrial software developers or software companies—possibly because existing frameworks are infused with academic premises that rarely apply to industrial settings. In this paper, we analyse the requirements of current industry-driven software projects and show how we are able to cope with these requirements in the Java Intelligent Agent Componentware agent framework, JIAC V. We argue that the lack of industry-grade requirements and features in other agent frameworks is one of the reasons for the slow acceptance of agent technology in the software industry. The JIAC V framework tries to bridge that gap—not as a final solution, but as a stepping stone towards industrial acceptance.

  **Abstract**

  With the increase of computing power and the development of user-friendly multi-agent simulation frameworks, social simulations have become in- creasingly realistic. However, most agent architectures in these simulations use simple reactive models. Cognitive architectures face two main obstacles: their complexity for the field-expert modeler, and their computational cost. In this paper, we propose a new cognitive agent architecture based on the BDI (Belief- Desire-Intention) paradigm integrated into the GAMA modeling platform. Based on the GAML modeling language, this architecture was designed to be simple- to-use for modelers, flexible enough to manage complex behaviors, and with low computational cost. This architecture is illustrated with a simulation of the evo- lution of land use in the Mekong Delta.

  

- [A UML Based Approach for Modelin and Implementing Multi-Agent Systems.pdf](a_uml_based_approach_for_modelin_and_Implementing multi-agent_systems.pdf) 

  **Abstract**

  In this paper we present an agent-oriented modeling language called MAS-ML and an approach for mapping MAS-ML diagrams into Java implementations. MAS-ML extends the UML meta-model describing new meta-classes and stereotypes, extending the class and sequence diagrams and proposing two new diagrams: organization and role diagram. The paper also relates MAS-ML to other modeling languages that also extend the UML for modeling multi-agent systems.

- [Agent Based Methodology.pdf](agent_based_meth.pdf) 

  **Abstract**

  Potentially one of the most significant opportunities for enterprise integration is the recent development and advancement of agent based systems. However, before agents can be used as generic building blocks, a methodology must be established for the development of these systems. This methodology must encompass modelling, design, and implementation of the systems. This paper outlines a methodology for the software engineering of agent based systems. The methodology is based upon the IDEF (ICAM Definition) approach for workflow modelling and analysis, the CIMOSA enterprise modelling framework, and the use case driven approach to object oriented software engineering. The methodology is illustrated via a case study in the area of discrete parts manufacturing.

  **Abstract**

  Agent-based modeling is a new analytical method for the social sciences, but one that is quickly becoming popular. This short book explains what agent-based modeling is. It also warns of some dangers and describes typi- cal ways of doing agent-based modeling. Finally, it offers a range of exam- ples from many of the social sciences.

  This first chapter begins with a brief overview of agent-based model- ing before contrasting it with other, perhaps more familiar forms of mod- eling and describing several examples of current agent-based modeling research. Chapter 2 goes into more detail, considering a range of metho- dological and theoretical issues and explaining what ‘‘agents’’ are. Chap- ter 3 dives into the specifics of building agent-based models, reviewing available software platforms and showing step by step how one can build an agent-based models using one of these. Chapter 4 provides some prac- tical advice about designing agent-based models, using them in social science research, and publishing articles based on agent-based modeling. Finally, Chapter 5 discusses the future of agent-based modeling research and where advances are likely to be made. The book concludes with a list of resources useful to agent-based modelers on the Web and in print.

  Agent-based simulation has become increasingly popular as a modeling approach in the social sciences because it enables one to build models where individual entities and their interactions are directly represented. In comparison with variable-based approaches using structural equations, or system-based approaches using differential equations, agent-based simulation offers the possibility of modeling individual heterogeneity, representing explicitly agents’ decision rules, and situating agents in a geographical or another type of space. It allows modelers to represent in a natural way multiple scales of analysis, the emergence of structures at the macro or societal level from individual action, and various kinds of adaptation and learning, none of which is easy to do with other modeling approaches.

  In this paper, they investigate a proposal where Blockchains could provide powerful tools for Multi Agent Systems. Specially regarding accountability, Blockchains could prove to be very useful tools for agents to reason upon contracts, commitments, responsibilities and so on. We list some possible approaches to integrate blockchains and Multi Agent Systems, by providing adequate abstractions and discussing over possible advantages and disadvantages of these different abstractions.
