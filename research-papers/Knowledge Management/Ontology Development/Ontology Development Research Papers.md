- [An Ontology For Modelling Human Resources Management Based on Standards.pdf](an_ontology_for_modelling_human_resources_management_based_on_standards.pdf) 
  Ontologies are used to model descriptions of job offers and curricula; and for facilitating the process of exchanging job offer data and CV data between Employemt Services(ES). In this paper presents the methodological approach we followed for reusing existing human resources management standards in the SEEMP project, in order to build a common “language” called Reference Ontology.

  

- [Business Process Ontology for Defining User Story.pdf](business_process_ontology_for_defining_user_story.pdf) 
  Writing a user story is essential to communicate with end users and developers. It is popular practices found in most agile methodologies. Therefore, to reuse the user stories from the previous successful projects becomes necessary. In this paper, they propose the business process ontology for defining user story. The ontology is a knowledge base designed to collect the user stories in term of N-triple. The ontology schema is designed using classes and hierarchy relation along with the properties according to Role-Action-Object relations. We introduce the synonym property to simplify and reduce the number of the nodes in the ontology as well. Finally, we demonstrate how to initially populate and build the ontology from the historical user stories.

  

- [detecting_compliance_with_business_rules_in_ontology-based_process_modeling.pdf](detecting_compliance_with_business_rules_in_ontology-based_process_modeling.pdf) 
  Extending business processes with semantic annotations has gained recent attention. This comprises relating process elements to ontology elements in order to create a shared conceptual and terminological understanding. In business process modeling, processes may have to adhere to a multitude of rules. A common way to detect compliance automatedly is studying the artifact of the process model itself. However, if an ontology exists as an additional artifact, it may prove beneficial to exploit this structure for compliance detection, as it provides a rich specification of the business process. This paper therefore propose an approach that models a rules-layer ontop of an ontology. Said rules-layer is implemented by a logic program and can be used to reason about the compliance of an underlying ontology. Our approach allows ad-hoc access to external ontologies, other than similar approaches that are reliant on a redundant logical representation of process model elements.

  

- [generating_ltag_grammars_from_a_lexicon_ontology_interface.pdf](generating_ltag_grammars_from_a_lexicon_ontology_interface.pdf) 

  This paper shows how domain-specific grammars can be automatically generated from a declarative model of the lexicon-ontology in- terface and how those grammars can be used for question answering. We show a spe- cific implementation of the approach using Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammars. The main characteristic of the generated elemen- tary trees is that they constitute domains of lo- cality that span lexicalizations of ontological concepts rather than being based on require- ments of single lexical heads.

  

- [How to Write and Use the Ontology Requirements Specification Document.pdf](how_to_write_and_use_the_ontology_requirements_specification_document.pdf) 

  The goal of the ontology requirements specification activity is to state why the ontology is being built, what its intended uses are, who the end- users are, and which requirements the ontology should fulfill. The novelty of this paper lies in the systematization of the ontology requirements specification activity since the paper proposes detailed methodological guidelines for speci- fying ontology requirements efficiently. These guidelines will help ontology engineers to capture ontology requirements and produce the ontology require- ments specification document (ORSD). The ORSD will play a key role during the ontology development process because it facilitates, among other activities, (1) the search and reuse of existing knowledge-aware resources with the aim of re-engineering them into ontologies, (2) the search and reuse of existing onto- logical resources (ontologies, ontology modules, ontology statements as well as ontology design patterns), and (3) the verification of the ontology along the on- tology development. In parallel to the guidelines, we present the ORSD that re- sulted from the ontology requirements specification activity within the SEEMP project, and how this document facilitated not only the reuse of existing knowl- edge-aware resources but also the verification of the SEEMP ontologies. Moreover, we present some use cases in which the methodological guidelines proposed here were applied.

  

- [Ontology and Goal Model in Designing BDI Multi-Agent Systems.pdf](ontology_and_goal_model_in_designing_bdi_multi-agent_systems.pdf) 

  Nowadays several methodological approaches exist, each of them tightly tied up with the implementation platform supporting it. In this paper they propose an intermediate step toward the definition of a methodological approach for supporting the JACAMO framework. This paper resumes a previous work, focused on modeling BDI organizations, and we now address the requirements analysis phase. In particular, we propose the use of an ontological model and a goal model for representing requirements and the domain formalization respectively. The two portions of design process are connected by a heuristic process that allows to extract goals from the ontological model. The resulting models are also used for completing each other and for enhancing the problem description that is considered an input to our process. In the paper we use the well-known case study of the conference management system for illustrating the proposed portion of process.

  

- [Ontology Based Business Simulations.pdf](ontology_based_business_simulations.pdf) 

  Within business games there is a need to provide realistic feedback for decisions made, if such busi- ness games are to continue to remain relevant in increasingly complex business environments. We address this problem by using software agents to simulate individuals and to model their actions in response to business decisions. In our initial studies we have used software agents to simulate consumers who make buying de- cisions based on their private preferences and those prevalent within their social network. This approach can be applied to search for behavioural patterns in social structures and to verify predicted values based on a priori theoretical considerations. Individual behaviour can be modelled for each agent and its effects within the mar- ketplace can be examined by running simulations. Our simulations are founded upon the BDI software model (belief-desire-intention) combined with ontologies to make world knowledge available to the agents which can then determine their actions in accordance with this knowledge. We demonstrate how ontologies can be integ- rated into the BDI concept utilising the Jadex agent framework. Our examples are based upon the simulation of market mechanisms within the context of different industries. We use a framework, developed previously, known as AGADE within which each agent evolves its knowledge using an ontology maintained during the sim- ulation. This generic approach allows the simulation of various consumer scenarios which can be modelled by creating appropriate ontologies.

  

- [Ontology Focused Crowdsourcing Management.pdf](ontology_focused_crowdsourcing_management.pdf) 

  Companies should be aware of the market situation and have a connection to customers, possible customers, and other individuals around a company. Crowdsourcing is the act of going inside or outside of the company’s normal organizational set-up to an undefined crowd, and it can be utilized in several ways to produce value for a company. Ontologies provide a better understanding of different concepts and can be utilized for managing a company’s activities in a holistic way. This paper introduces ontology-focused crowdsourcing management. Crowdsourcing of a company is constructed via several concepts which are crucial for succeeding in crowdsourcing activities. Current crowdsourcing ontology studies are lacking in holistic crowdsourcing views. This paper fills the research gap, providing a holistic view of crowdsourcing and its management.

  

- [Ontology for Information Systems Design Methodology.pdf](ontology_for_information_systems_design_methodology.pdf)

  Globalization has opened new frontiers for business enterprises and human com- munication. There is an information explosion that necessitates huge amounts of informa- tion to be speedily processed and acted upon. Information Systems aim to facilitate human decision-making by retrieving context-sensitive information, making implicit knowledge ex- plicit and to reuse the knowledge that has already been discovered. A possible answer to meet these goals is the use of Ontology.

  Ontology has been studied for a long time in the fields of AI, Logic and Linguistics. Cur- rent state-of-the art research in Information Systems has focused on the use of ontologies. However, there remain many obstacles for the practical and commercial use of ontologies for Information Systems. One such obstacle is that current Information System designers lack the know-how to successfully design an ontology. Current ontology design methodologies are difficult to use by Information Systems designers having little theoretical knowledge of ontol- ogy modeling. Another issue is that business enterprises mostly function in the social domain where there are complex underlying semantics and pragmatics involved.

  This research tries to solve some of these issues by proposing the *Ontology for Information Systems (O4IS) Design Methodology* for the design of *ontologies for Information Systems*. The research also proposes a *Unified Semantic Procedural Pragmatic Design* for explicit conceptu- alization of the semantics and pragmatics of a domain. We further propose a set of *Semantic Analysis Representations* as conceptual analysis patterns for semantic relationship identifica- tion. We also put forward the *Dual Conceptual Representation* so that the designed ontology is understandable by both humans and machines. Finally, a logical architecture for domain ontology design called the *Multi-Tier Domain Ontology Architecture* is proposed.

  We follow the design science in Information Systems research methodology. The proposed solutions are demonstrated through two case studies carried out in different domains. The first case study is that of business contract knowledge management, which focuses on the analysis of contractual obligations, their fulfillment via the performance of business actions, and the deduction of a contract compliant workflow model. The second case study relates to military operations simulations and modeling. The emphasis in this case study is to analyze, model and represent the domain knowledge as a re-usable resource to be used in a number of modeling and simulation applications.
