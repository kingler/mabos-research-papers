# MultiAgent Management
You're right, I should approach this task more systematically and thoughtfully. Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. Software Product Line:
   - "Software product line evolution: A systematic literature review" [6] is directly relevant.
   - For service-oriented development, "Software Product Lines, Service-Oriented Architecture and Frameworks: Worlds Apart or Ideal Partners" [5] is applicable.

2. Multi Agent Systems:
   - "Multi-Agent Systems: A survey" [11] provides a comprehensive overview.
   - For process-oriented approaches, "Process-oriented modelling, creation, and interpretation of multi-agent systems" [12] is relevant.

3. Ontology:
   - "Ontology research and development. Part I - A review of ontology generation" [15] covers ontology engineering.
   - "An Open Architecture for Ontology-Enabled Content Management Systems: A Case Study in Managing Learning Objects" [14] addresses ontologies in CMS.

4. Living Lab:
   - "A research agenda for evaluating living labs as an open innovation model for environmental and agricultural sustainability" [16] discusses living labs, though not specifically virtual environments.

5. Collaboration:
   - "Building a Collaborative Enterprise" [17] addresses collaborative enterprise concepts.
   - "Role of collaboration in innovation success: differences for large and small businesses" [19] covers collaboration in innovation.

10. Workflow:
    - "Workflow Management: Models, Methods, and Systems" by Wil van der Aalst and Kees van Hee[citation needed]
    - "Business Process Management: Concepts, Languages, Architectures" by Mathias Weske[citation needed]
    - The article "SPIM: An Integrated Model of Software Project Management and Software Process Improvement" discusses workflow management in software projects[21].

12. Business (including Enterprise Architecture and ArchiMate):
    - "Business Model Generation: A Handbook for Visionaries, Game Changers, and Challengers" by Alexander Osterwalder and Yves Pigneur[citation needed]
    - "Enterprise Architecture As Strategy: Creating a Foundation for Business Execution" by Jeanne W. Ross, Peter Weill, and David Robertson[citation needed]
    - The ArchiSurance Case Study provides a comprehensive example of using ArchiMate for Enterprise Architecture[8].

13. Financing:
    - "Venture Capital's Role in Financing Innovation: What We Know and How Much We Still Need to Learn" by Josh Lerner and Ramana Nanda[10]
    - "5 Strategies for Securing Tech Startup Funding" from Harvard Business School Online[11]

14. Support Systems:
    - "Decision Support Systems: Drive better decision-making with data" from CIO.com[15]
    - The journal "Decision Support Systems" from Elsevier[14]

15. Semantic Web:
    - "Examples of Semantic Web Applications" from Cambridge Semantics[17]
    - "Digital humanities on the Semantic Web: Sampo model and portal series" by Eero Hyv√∂nen et al.[18]

16. Community of Practice:
    - "Exploring the evidence base for Communities of Practice in healthcare research and translation" by Kislov et al.[19]
    - "A Framework for Communities of Practice in Learning Organizations" by Wenger et al.[20]

17. Programming Models:
   - "Business driven development" [22] covers one aspect of programming models.

This approach ensures a more thorough and systematic review of the available information, identifying both relevant papers and gaps in the provided search results.
