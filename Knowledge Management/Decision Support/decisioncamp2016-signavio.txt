1) Breaking down complex situations into 
manageable elements. 
2) Matching the elements with data, 
operators and functions. 
3) Structuring data where appropriate.

14Parsing Requirements for Business Rules
It is possible to look at a written requirement and 
derive the business rules.
One way is the to look for the 4 C’s, a business 
rule Compares, Computes, and Categorizes in 
order to Control something
The first 3 C’s are characteristics of the Inputs
The last, Control is the result of the rule 
evaluation
