ModelingWe are seeing very significant 
improvement in development 
Cost/Time/Quality….But the last mile in implementing decisions remains 
data integration: the Cost of this step remains high 
and the time unimproved by model based 
development…

The Solution: The Business Logical Unit
•The Business Logical Unit is the name given to a model of the information 
inputs and outputs of a given decision model
•Thus we are able to extend the model based paradigm into the data 
integration implementation for decision models.
•The Business Logical model is implemented in a tool we call Sapiens Decision 
InfoHub (DI)
•Our experience of this tool in the field shows:
•Reduction in time and cost of data integration in the development and change cycles
•Improved data governance 
•Significantly enhanced decision execution performance 
•Strengthened security of the data in the execution environment

The Business Logical Unit vs Classic Data Approaches
TRADITIONAL RDBMS
•Data is scattered across multiple systems 
(e.g. CRM, Billing, etc.)
•Each system is independent 
•Very hard to access all data corresponding 
to one entity (e.g. customer)UNSTRUCTURED BIG DATA
•Data is stored and distributed in big data 
system (e.g. Hadoop)
•No business logic in storage
•Data access for one entity requires lookup 
through massive amount of data BUSINESS LOGICAL UNIT
•Data is represented by BLU
•Distributed storage on demand
•Data access for one instance is a core feature
•Aligns with DM Glossary giving a business view 
of the data required for a given decision

Business Logical Unit –Definitions
•Generic word used to encapsulate the concept behind the business -oriented 
representation of data in the DecisionBUSINESS LOGICAL UNIT (BLU)
•Specific type of Business Logical Unit representing business -oriented data (e.g. Policy 
Renewal, Product Pricing, Patient Claim Eligibility, etc.)
•LUTs are configured in DI Studio BUSINESS LOGICAL UNIT TYPE (BLUT)
•Instance of a Logical Unit Type (e.g. Policy 123, Product N23RX, Patient 2344433456)
•Instances are the micro -databases stored in the DI serversBUSINESS LOGICAL UNIT INSTANCE (BLUI)

Flexible Synchronization
ON-DEMANDSYNC
On-demand calls triggered by web services, batch 
scripts or directly querying InfoHub (administrative 
mode).
InfoHub synchronization can be triggered using 
the principles of Change Data Capture (CDC). EVENT-BASEDSYNC
Timer based synchronizationsALWAYSYNC
Using and combining these synchronization strategies ensures that the data is available 
as needed by the execution environment

Row Level Security
Hierarchical Encryption -Key Schema (HEKS) 
implemented for two BLU types
•1 Master Key allowing full access
•2 Type Keys restricting access to 2 
different BLU Types
•6 Instance Keys, 3 for each BLU Type 
restricting access at the BLU Instance 
level

Architecture
KEY TO THE LAYERS IN THE DIAGRAM
CONFIGURATION: The versioned configuration of every 
Logical Unit Type, accessed through administration tools 
(Admin Manager, Studio and Web Admin interfaces).
WEB/DATABASE SERVICES: Communicates with user 
applications: either via direct queries (database services) 
or via web services.
AUTHENTICATION ENGINE: Manages user access control 
and restrictions.
MASKING LAYER: Optional, allows real time masking of 
sensitive data.
PROCESSING ENGINE: Where every data computation is 
managed; it uses the principles of massive parallel 
processing and map -reduce in order execute operations.
SMART DATA CONTROLLER: Drives the real -time 
synchronization of data to InfoHub.
ETL LAYER: Embedded migration layer, allowing for 
automated ETL on retrieval.
ENCRYPTION ENGINE: Manages
the granular encryption of each data set.
LU STORAGE MANAGER: Compresses and send data to 
the distributed database for storage. InfoHub leverages 
Cassandra as the distributed database. The 
communication between the distributed databases is very 
straight forward, making InfoHub a flexible solution that 
can be adapted to any other distributed database.
