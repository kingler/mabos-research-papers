Abstract.  The goal of the ontology requirements specification activity is to 
state why the ontology is being built, what its intended uses are, who the end-
users are, and which requirements the ontology should fulfill. The novelty of 
this paper lies in the systematization of the ontology requirements specification activity since the paper proposes detailed methodological guidelines for speci-
fying ontology requirements efficiently. These guidelines will help ontology 
engineers to capture ontology requirements and produce the ontology require-ments specification document (ORSD). Th e ORSD will play a key role during 
the ontology development process because  it facilitates, among other activities, 
(1) the search and reuse of existing knowledge-aware resources with the aim of re-engineering them into ontologies, (2 ) the search and reuse of existing onto-
logical resources (ontologies, ontology modules, ontology statements as well as 
ontology design patterns), and (3) the verification of the ontology along the on-tology development. In parallel to the gu idelines, we present the ORSD that re-
sulted from the ontology requirements specification activity within the SEEMP 
project, and how this document facilitate d not only the reuse of existing knowl-
edge-aware resources but also the verification of the SEEMP ontologies.  
Moreover, we present some use cases in which the methodological guidelines 
proposed here were applied.  
Keywords: Ontology Requirements, Competency Questions, Ontology  
Requirements Specification, and Methodologies. 
1   Introduction 
One of the key processes in software development is software specification [13], 
whose aim is to understand and define what functionalities are required from the software product. This process leads to the production of a software requirements 
document [13], that is, the specification for the software product. It has been proved 
that a detailed software requirements document provides several benefits [10], such as: (a) the establishment of the basis for agreement between customers and suppliers on what the software product is supposed to do, (b) the reduction of the development 
 How to Write and Use the Ontology Requirements Specification Document 967 
effort, (c) the provision of a basis for estimating costs and schedules, and (d) the offer 
of a baseline for validation and verification. 
When a software application based on onto logies is being developed, ontology re-
quirements should be identified in addition to the application ones. Our experience in building ontology-based applications, in domains as different as satellite data process-ing
1, finding funding programs2, fishery stocks3 and e-employment4, has showed that 
more critical than capturing software requirements was the efficient and precise iden-tification of the knowledge that the ontology should contain. Up to now, application developers already have precise methodologies [13, 10, 18] that help them to define application requirements. However, guidelines included in current methodologies for building ontologies are not enough for defining ontology requirements. 
The analysis of the state of the art of Ontological Engineering reveals that most of 
the methodologies for building ontologies include the ontology requirements specifi-cation activity. In this regard, we can mention that METHONTOLOGY [5] identifies 
the goals of the ontology requirements specification activity; however, this method-
ology does not propose any method for carrying out the activity. Grüninger and Fox’s methodology [8], On-To-Knowledge methodology [14], and the Unified methodology [17] propose the identification of the following aspects for creating the ontology requirements specification document (ORSD): (1) the purpose of the ontol-ogy to be developed, (2) the intended uses and users of the ontology to be developed, 
and (3) the set of ontology requirements that the ontology should satisfy after being 
formally implemented. Most of the existing methodologies suggest the identification of competency questions (CQs) [8] as the technique for establishing the ontology requirements. CQs are natural language questions that the ontology to be built should be able to answer. CQs and their responses play the role of a type of requirements specification against which the ontology can be evaluated. Although the aforemen-
tioned methodologies propose methods for carrying out the ontology requirements 
specification activity consisting of high level steps, they do not provide detailed guidelines that explain how to carry out each step, what it is needed for obtaining a good ORSD; nor how the ORSD can be used later on in the ontology development (for instance, to search knowledge-aware resources to be reused and to verify the 
ontology content). 
The innovation of this paper lies in the systematization of the ontology require-
ments specification activity since the paper proposes efficient, prescriptive and  detailed methodological guidelines for specifying ontology requirements. Our guide-lines are based on the use of the so-called CQs and are inspired by existing method-ologies for building ontologies and by available practices and previous experiences 
in different national and European funded projects. These methodological guidelines 
help to capture knowledge from users and to produce the ORSD that will be used by ontology engineers in order to develop an ontology that will fulfill the requirements identified. Therefore, the main purpose of an ORSD is to serve as an agreement

among ontology engineers, users and domain experts on what requirements the on-
tology should cover. 
When building knowledge intensive systems, the ORSD will be decisive along the 
ontology development process because it will facilitate, among other activities, the search and reuse of existing knowledge-aware resources for re-engineering them into 
ontologies; the search and reuse of existing ontologies, ontology modules, ontology 
statements (e.g., using Watson
5 or Swoogle6), or ontology design patterns; and the 
verification of the ontology during the whole ontology development. The methodo-logical guidelines presented in this paper have been created in the context of the NeOn Methodology  [4] within the NeOn project
7. They have been validated by users 
in different ontology-based applications inside and outside the NeOn project. 
In addition to the guidelines, we also present a particular ORSD resulting from the 
ontology requirements specification activ ity carried out within the SEEMP project8, 
whose goals were to develop a knowledge intensive and interoperable architecture 
based on ontologies for public e-Employment services (PES), and to enable a feder-ated market place of employme nt mediation agencies through a peer-to-peer network 
based on interoperation. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 includes the methodologi-
cal guidelines for the ontology requirements specification activity, and the ORSD obtained in the SEEMP project as an example. Section 3 shows how the methodologi-cal guidelines and the ORSD were used in different cases. Section 4 explains in detail how the ORSD was used within the SEEMP project to search and reuse knowledge-
aware resources and to evaluate the resultant ontology. Finally, Section 5 provides the 
conclusions. 
2   Methodological Guidelin es for Ontology Requirements 
Specification 
In this section we explain the guidelines set out to help ontology developers in the 
ontology requirements specification activity. Such guidelines have been created in the 
context of the NeOn Methodology  [4] for building ontology networks. This methodol-
ogy takes into account the existence of multiple ontologies in ontology networks, the 
collaborative ontology development, the dynamic dimension, and the reuse and re-
engineering of knowledge-aware resources. One of the key elements in this method-ology is the set of 9 scenarios identified for building ontologies and ontology networks.  
It is worth also mentioning that in the framework of the NeOn Methodology there 
are prescriptive methodological guidelines
9 for carrying out different processes and 
activities involved in the ontology development: ontology requirements specification 
(presented in this paper), scheduling ontology projects, reuse and re-engineering non-ontological resources, reuse ontological resources, reuse ontology design patterns,

ontology modularization, ontology localization, ontology evaluation and ontology 
evolution. 
To create the methodological guidelines in the NeOn Methodology, we based on 
the different studies carried out to revise the state of the art of ontology development, on the experience of developers on building ontologies in different projects, and on 
the analysis of various project use cases. All the methodological guidelines are de-
scribed using a filling card and a workflow. 
Thus, taking into account the aforementioned methodological work [4], the filling 
card for the ontology requirements specificatio n activity is provided in Fig. 1. Such 
filling card explains the information of this activity in a practical and easy way.

The output of the ontology requirements specification activity is the ORSD. A 
template (shown in Table 1) for the creation of the ORSD document is also provided in this section. This template contains information about the purpose, scope, imple-mentation language, intended end-users, intended uses, requirements, and pre-glossary of terms of the ontology which is being built.

Next, in Fig. 2 we present the methodological guidelines for carrying out the on-
tology requirements specification activity in a detailed and prescriptive manner, 
showing the main tasks involved, their inputs, outputs and actors. The tasks shown in 
Fig. 2 are explained bellow. 
Additionally, in this section we provide, as an example, the ORSD created within the 
SEEMP project, in which ontology developers have followed the guidelines and used the template proposed in this paper. For a detailed specification please refer to [11].

Fig. 2.  Tasks for Ontology Requirements Specification 
Task 1. Identify purpose, scope and implementation language.  The objective is to 
determine the main goal of the ontology, its coverage and foreseeable granularity, and its implementation language (e.g., OWL, RDFS, WSML, etc.). The ontology devel-opment team has a set of interviews with users and domain experts to carry out this 
task taking as input a set of ontological needs, that is, the necessity of having the 
knowledge represented in the form of an ontology. Users and domain experts are 
972 M.C. Suárez-Figueroa, A. Gómez-Pérez, and B. Villazón-Terrazas 
crucial to identify the purpose and scope of the ontology; the formal language to be 
used for implementing the ontology should be decided by ontology developers. The task output is included in slots 1-3 of the template shown in Table 1. The output in the SEEMP ORSD is shown in Table 2.  
Task 2. Identify intended end-users.  The goal of this task is to establish who the main 
intended end-users of the ontology are. The ontology development team has a set of 
interviews with users and domain experts to carry out this task taking as input a set of ontological needs. The task output is a list containing the intended users of the ontol-ogy to be built, which is included in slot 4 of the template shown in Table 1. The output in the SEEMP ORSD is shown in Table 2.

Task 3. Identify intended uses.  The development of an ontology is mainly motivated 
by scenarios related to the application that will use the ontology. The goal of this task is to obtain the intended uses and use scenarios of the ontology. The ontology devel-opment team has a set of interviews with users and domain experts to carry out this task taking as input a set of ontological needs; the purpose here is to obtain the uses of 
the ontology within the application, and to have a general idea of the application re-
quirements. The task output is a list of intended uses in the form of scenarios, which is included in slot 5 of the template shown in Table 1. Such scenarios describe a set of general ontology requirements that the ontology should satisfy after being formally implemented. The scenarios should be described in natural language and can be ex-pressed in UML as use cases. The output in the SEEMP ORSD is shown in Table 2.  
Task 4. Identify requirements.  The goal of this task is to acquire the set of require-
ments that the ontology should satisfy. Taking as inspiration the Software Engineer-ing field, in which requirements are divided into functional
10 and non-functional11 
requirements [13], we also divide ontology requirements into the following two types, whose definition is different those in Software Engineering:  
 
• Non-functional ontology requirements  refer to the characteristics, qualities, or 
general aspects not related to the ontology content that the ontology should 
satisfy. Examples of non-functional requirements are: (a) whether the termi-
nology to be used in the ontology must be taken from standards, (b) whether the ontology must be multilingual, or (c) whether the ontology should be writ-ten following a specific naming convention.  
• Functional ontology requirements , which can be also seen as content specific 
requirements, refer to the particular knowledge to be represented by the ontol-
ogy, for example in the SEEMP case, the knowledge about curriculum vitae 
with candidate skills, education level, expertise, previous work experience, or about job offers including job location, salary, etc. 
 
The ontology development team should interview users and domain experts taking as input a set of ontological needs, and obtain as result the initial set of ontology re-quirements (non-functional and functional) of the ontology to be built. To identify functional requirements, the ontology development team uses as main technique the writing of the requirements in natural language in the form of the so-called CQs. 
Mind map tools [1] and Excel can be used for obtaining the requirements. If people 
are geographically distributed, wiki tools, such as Cicero
12, can also be employed.  
Some strategies for identifying CQs are: 
• Top-Down: The team starts with complex questions that are decomposed in 
simpler ones. 
• Bottom-Up: The team starts with simple questions that are composed to struc-
ture/create complex ones. 
                                                           
10 Functional requirements refer to required behavior of the system, that is, functionalities the 
software system should have. 
11 Non-functional requirements refer to implicit expectations about how well the software 
system should work. That is, these requirements can be seen as aspects about the system or 
as ‘non-behavior’ requirements.

974 M.C. Suárez-Figueroa, A. Gómez-Pérez, and B. Villazón-Terrazas 
• Middle out: The team starts just writing down important questions that are 
composed and decomposed later on to form abstract and simple questions re-spectively. 
The output of this task is (1) a list of non-functional ontology requirements written in 
natural language, which is included in slot 6a of the template shown in Table 1, and (2) a list functional ontology requirements in the form of CQs and their associated answers that is the input of task 5. The list of non-functional requirements in the SEEMP ORSD is shown in Table 3; the list of CQs and their responses are grouped in task 5 and included in slot 6b of SEEMP ORSD shown in Table 4.   
Table 3.  SEEMP ORSD Slot 6a 
6 Ontology Requirements 
a. Non-Functional Requirements 
NFR1.  The ontology must support a multilingual scenario in the following lan-
guages: English, Spanish, Italian, and French. 
NFR2.  The ontology must be based on the international, European or de-facto 
standards in existence or under development. 
 
Task 5. Group requirements.  The goal of this task is to group the list of CQs obtained 
in task 4 into several categories. Users, domain experts and the ontology development 
team should classify the list of CQs written in natural language using a hybrid ap-proach that not only combines pre-established categories such as time and date, units of measure, currencies, location, languages, etc., but it also creates categories for those terms that appear with the highest frequencies in the list of CQs. 
Techniques such as card sorting can be used when the grouping is done manually, 
whereas techniques for clustering natural language sentences or for information ex-traction can be used when the grouping is done automatically. In addition, mind map tools can help to display graphically the CQs in groups or Cicero if the grouping is done collaboratively.  
The task output is the set of groups of CQs and responses, which is included in slot 
6b of the template. The output in the SEEMP ORSD is shown in Table 4. 
Usually this task is carried out in parallel with task 4. 
Task 6. Validate the set of requirements , including both non-functional and func-
tional ontology requirements. The aim here is to identify possible conflicts between ontology requirements, missing ontology requirements, and contradictions between them. Users and domain experts must carry out this task taking as input the set of 
requirements identified in task 4 to decide if each element of the set is valid or not. 
The task output is the confirmation of the validity of the set of non-functional and functional ontology requirements. 
The following criteria can be used in this validation task and they are mainly in-
spired by [9, 2]:  
• A set of requirements is correct if each requirement refers to some features of 
the ontology to be developed. 
 How to Write and Use the Ontology Requirements Specification Document 975 
• Inspired by [19], a set of requirements can be considered complete, if users 
and domain experts review the requirements and confirm that they are not aware of additional requirements.  
• A set of requirements can be considered internally consistent if no conflicts 
exist between them.  
• A set of requirements is verifiable, if th ere is a finite process with a reasonable 
cost that tests whether the final ontology satisfies each requirement. 
• Each requirement must be understandable to end-users and domain experts.  
• An ontology requirement is unambiguous if it has only one meaning; that is, if 
it does not admit any doubt or misunderstanding. 
• A set of requirements is concise, if each and every requirement is relevant, and 
no duplicated or irrelevant requirements exist.  
• A set of requirements is realist, if each and every requirement meaning makes 
sense in the domain. 
• A set of requirements is modifiable if its structure and style allow changing is-
sues in an easy, complete and consistent way.  
Task 7. Prioritize requirements.  The goal here is to give different levels of priority to 
the non-functional and functional ontology requirements identified. In the case of functional ontology requirements, priorities should be given to the different groups of CQs, and, within each group, to the different CQs. Users, domain experts and the ontology development team should carry out this task taking as input the requirements identified in task 4 and the groups of CQs written in natural language obtained in task 
5. The task output is a set of priorities attached to each requirement and to each group 
of CQs and to each CQ in a group. The output is included in the slots 6a and 6b of the template. 
Priorities in CQs will be used by the ontology development team for planning and 
scheduling the ontology development and for deciding which parts of the ontology are 
going to be developed first. This task is optional, but recommended. In fact, if no 
priorities are given to the groups of CQs, ontology developers will start modeling the ontology without any guidance regarding the requirements that should be imple-mented first; in this case the waterfall ontology life cycle model should be selected during the scheduling of the ontology project. On the contrary, if different priorities have been assigned to ontology requirements, the iterative-incremental ontology life 
cycle model [15] should be selected in the scheduling activity. 
 
Task 8. Extract terminology and its frequency . The goal is to extract from the list of 
CQs and their answers a pre-glossary of terms. This pre-glossary of terms is divided 
in three different parts: terms from the CQs, terms from the CQs’ answers, and terms 
identified as named entities, which are objects. From the requirements in the form of CQs, we extract terminology (names, adjectives and verbs) that will be formally rep-resented in the ontology by means of concep ts, attributes, relations or instances (in the 
case of named entities). From the answers to the CQs, we extract terminology that could be represented in the ontology as concepts or as instances. From both CQs and 
corresponding answers, we extract named entities such as countries or currencies. The 
output is included in the slots 7a, 7b and 7c of the template, respectively. The set of terms with higher appearance frequencies will be used later on for searching knowl-edge-aware resources that could be potentially reused in the ontology development.

3   Experimentation  
Both the methodological guidelines and the ORSD template presented in this paper 
have been used in the NeOn project and in the development of ontologies in other 
research and educational projects with positive feedback and interesting comments from the ontology developers involved in each  case. In this section we briefly summa-
rize a set of such cases, presenting qualitative results
13. 
The invoice use case , whose main aim is to solve the lack of interoperability be-
tween invoice emitters and receivers; and the nomenclature use case , whose main 
objectives are to help in the systematiza tion of the creation, maintenance and keeping 
up-to-date drug-related information, and to allow an easy integration of new drug resources, within the NeOn project [16, 7]. Ontology developers in both use cases provided positive feedback about the usefulness of the guidelines, the goodness of writing an ORSD prior to the ontology development, and the benefits of using the

ORSD as input to other activities (e.g., reuse of knowledge-aware resources and on-
tology verification). Moreover, ontology developers realized the importance of having guidelines for the ontology requirements specification. However, they commented that examples on how to use the guidelines would be very useful for understanding and applying such guidelines in a better way. 
The development of ontologies  representing the knowledge related with the 
“Camino de Santiago ” (Saint James’s Way) in the Geobuddies
14 project . Ontology 
developers included, besides the previous advantages, the usefulness of the pre-glossary of terms during the ontology reuse process and the conceptualization activity. 
The hands-on session during the Sixth Summer School on Ontologies and Se-
mantic Web
15, in which we tested the combination of the ontology requirements 
specification activity and the ontology reuse process using Watson with 50 students. 
In this case, we obtained a very positive feedback from most of the students who carried out the hands-on. They stated that the proposed guidelines were useful, and that they would like to use anew such guidelines in future ontology developments. They also expressed that the writing of the ORSD before going into the ontology development was by no means a waste of time, and that the ORSD was useful in the 
ontology development. 
Two experiments  to test the benefits of using the ontology requirements specifica-
tion guidelines proposed in this paper were carried out with students at UPM during 
the academic years 2007-2008 and 2008-2009 . Such experiments were performed 
within the “Artificial Intelligence (AI)” master course at Facultad de Informática  
(Universidad Politécnica de Madrid ) with master students whose backgrounds in-
cluded databases, software engineering, and artificial intelligence, but not ontology engineering. One of the experiments was carried out during November 2007 with 14 master students working in groups of two people; the other was performed during November 2008 with 12 master students working in groups of one or two people. Both experiments were carried out with methodological guidelines for the ontology requirements specification activity. Most of  the students considered that the guide-
lines for the ontology requirements specification activity were useful. All of them 
expressed their intention of using again the methodological guidelines for the ontol-
ogy requirements specification activity. However, some of the students commented they would prefer to have such guidelines integrated in an ontology requirements specification tool. Students also stated that they found useful to write the ontology requirements specification document before going into the ontology development. Additionally, students commented that (1) the three first tasks in the methodological guidelines should be explained in more detail; (2) the tasks of writing and validating CQs, as well as giving priority to CQ, could be further described; and (3) the task about extracting terminology should be clarified.  
As already mentioned, the guidelines for the ontology requirements specification 
activity proposed here were used in the development of the SEEMP Reference 
Ontology
16. In Section 4 we present how the final ORSD obtained in such a project 
was used during the ontology development. Such a final ORSD has been presented in Section 2 as an example while the methodological guidelines were explained.

Additionally, it is worth mentioning that comments provided by ontology develop-
ers involved in the aforementioned cases are allowing us to improve and update the methodological guidelines for the ontology requirements specification activity. 
4   Ontology Requirements Specifi cation and Other Activities 
The guidelines presented here for the ontology requirements specification activity 
were used in the development of ontologies in the public e-Employment services 
domain within the SEEMP project. In this section we present how the ontology re-
quirements specification document allows (a) a more direct search for available knowledge resources to be reused in the ontology development, and (b) the evaluation of the ontology content. 
Terms with the highest frequency included in the pre-glossary of terms of the 
ORSD were used to direct the search of existing knowledge-aware resources that 
cover the terminology in question in internet and in standardization bodies (e.g. ISO 
and proprietary resources in the intranet of companies). We also looked for existing ontologies using Watson and other semantic search engines. Thus, the ORSD was the key input in the search process in the following way: 
 
• We searched for time ontologies describing the terms related with time and date 
management (e.g., year, month, etc.). We used the comparative study of nine time ontologies presented in [3] and then we selected the DAML Time Ontology
17. 
• We searched for standards of occupations and economic activities in high reliable 
Web sites, domain-related sites and resources within organizations, instead of 
starting from scratch the identification of an exhaustive list of occupations on the 
IT domain and a list of economic activities. As a result of the search we found four potential non-ontological resources that included terms related to occupa-tion, and three potential non-ontological resources related to economic activities. 
• Using NeOn guidelines for reusing knowledge-aware resources [16], we assessed 
the set of candidate non-ontological resources based on coverage and precision 
criteria. First, we extracted the lexical entries of the non-ontological resources. 
Then we calculated the coverage and pr ecision of the non-ontological resource 
lexical entries against the terms that app eared in the pre-glossary in the ORSD. 
The non-ontological resources with best coverage and precision, and thus the se-lected ones, were ISCO-88 (COM)
18 and ONET19 for occupations, and NACE18 
standard for economic activities. Then, these non-ontological resources were re-
engineered into ontologies. 
• Regarding geographical location classificati ons, we did the search in similar sites 
and we found four non-ontological resources including named entities related with geographical location (e.g. Spain, France). Following the NeOn guidelines, 
we selected the ISO 3166
20 standard and we transformed it into an ontology.

• Finally, we evaluated the resultant SEEMP Reference Ontology by means of the 
CQs from the ORSD. We formalized the CQs into SPARQL queries, and trans-formed the Reference Ontology WSML implementation into RDF(S). In this sense, we checked whether the query results of every formalized CQ were empty. 
 
Thus, the ORSD helped us to find existing consensual knowledge-aware resources to be used in the development of the SEEMP Reference Ontology [12]. This ontology is 
composed of thirteen modular ontologies, from which ten were built by reusing and 
re-engineering non-ontological resources, and three were built from scratch. The Reference Ontology has 1985 concepts, 315 attributes, 1449 instances and 1037 axi-oms. The ontology was built in 6 months. It must be said that at least 2 months were dedicated to the ontology requirements specification activity. Finally, the evaluation 
of the ontology lasted approximately one month. 
Our experience in SEEMP has served us to demonstrate that the approach to build 
the ORSD following detailed methodological guidelines saves time and effort during the ontology development. We compared our previous experiences developing on-tologies with the development of the SEEMP Reference Ontology and we realized that a decrease in the development time occu rred. For example, we developed a set of 
Legal Ontologies [6], without the guidelines described in this paper, spending 10 MM 
(man months) and, as already mentioned, we spent 6 MM for the development of the SEEMP Reference Ontology. It is worth mentioning that these two ontologies (Legal and SEEMP ones) have similar level of complexity. The ORSD, also, facilitated the reuse of existing ontologies, the reuse and later re-engineering of existing and already consensual non-ontological resources, and th e evaluation of the ontology content. In 
this paper we have demonstrated that with a good ORSD, better ontologies can be 
built faster. 
5   Conclusions 
One of the critical activities when developing ontologies is to identify their require-ments. In this paper we have systematized the ontology requirements specification activity by proposing detailed and prescriptive methodological guidelines for specify-
ing ontology requirements, and a template for writing the ORSD. When a particular 
ORSD is created, it can be used for speedi ng up the ontology development process. 
Terms and their frequencies from the pre-glossary in the ORSD can be used for searching and selecting already knowledge-aware and consensual resources that, after a re-engineering process if necessary, allow building ontologies cheaper, faster, and with higher quality. CQs in the ORSD can be used for verifying the correctness of the 
ontology with respect to the ontology requirements identified. 
The NeOn methodological guidelines for the ontology requirements specification 
activity and the ORSD template presented here have been used in the development of the NeOn ontologies and the development of ontologies in other research and educa-tional projects with interesting feedback from the ontology developers involved in each case. 
Finally, it is worth mentioning that the ORSD facilitates the ontology development 
in different ways: (1) allowing the identification of which particular knowledge should be represented in the ontology, (2) facilitating the reuse of existing knowledge 
 How to Write and Use the Ontology Requirements Specification Document 981 
resources by means of focusing the resource search towards the particular knowledge 
to be represented in the ontology, and (3) permitting the verification of the ontology with respect to the requirements that the ontology should fulfill. As in other disci-plines, a good specification (a) establishes the basis for agreement between the users and ontology developers, (b) reduces the development effort, (c) provides a basis for 
estimating costs and schedules, and (d) offers a baseline for verification.
