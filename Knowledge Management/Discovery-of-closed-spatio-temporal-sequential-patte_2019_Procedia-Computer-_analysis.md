## Title: Discovery of Closed Spatio-Temporal Sequential Patterns from Event Data

## Summary
The paper "Discovery of closed spatio-temporal sequential patterns from event data" by Piotr S. Maciąg, Marzena Kryszkiewicz, and Robert Bembenik discusses the development of a novel algorithm, CST-SPMiner, for mining closed spatio-temporal sequential patterns in event data. The authors focus on the participation index as a metric for significance and propose adaptations to existing algorithms to efficiently discover these patterns. The proposed method was validated using real crime data from Boston. The results indicate significant reductions in the number of discovered patterns without losing relevant information, showcasing CST-SPMiner’s efficiency and effectiveness.
