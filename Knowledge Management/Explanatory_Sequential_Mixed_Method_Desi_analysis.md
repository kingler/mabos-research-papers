# Title: Explanatory Sequential Mixed Method Design as the Third Research Community of Knowledge Claim

## Summary:
The paper "Explanatory Sequential Mixed Method Design as the Third Research Community of Knowledge Claim" by Dhanapati Subedi, published in the American Journal of Educational Research in 2016, addresses the dilemmas novice educational researchers face in adopting a research design. The paper emphasizes the pragmatic paradigm, proposing a mixed-method approach that integrates both qualitative (QUAL) and quantitative (QUAN) standpoints to offer a more comprehensive understanding of research phenomena. Key topics discussed include philosophical premises, generating research questions, data collection and analysis, ethical issues, quality of inference, and teaching mixed methodology. The paper champions the explanatory sequential design within mixed methods as highly popular among educational researchers.

## Key Components Analysis

### Main Research Question
The primary research question addressed in the paper is:
- How can explanatory sequential mixed-method design be optimized to aid novice educational researchers in conducting holistic and valid research investigations?

### Methodology
The methodology presented in the paper follows a structured approach to exploring and explaining the mixed-method design, specifically focusing on the explanatory sequential strategy. The methodology includes:
1. A review of the philosophical foundations (ontology, epistemology, and axiology) of mixed methods.
2. Steps for generating mixed-method research questions.
3. Detailed explanation of data collection and analysis in various mixed-method designs, with emphasis on the explanatory sequential design.
4. Ethical considerations in mixed-method research.
5. Strategies for ensuring the quality of inferences.
6. Guidelines for teaching mixed methodology.

### Key Findings and Results
1. Mixed methods provide a balanced approach that avoids biases inherent in purely qualitative or quantitative methods.
2. The explanatory sequential design is widely favored among educational researchers because it sequentially integrates QUAN data collection followed by QUAL data to refine and explain the findings.
3. Philosophically, pragmatism is suitable for mixed-method research because it integrates multiple viewpoints (both objective and subjective).

### Conclusions and Implications
The author concludes that explanatory sequential mixed-method design is effective in addressing the complex nature of educational research. The design aids in overcoming ontological, epistemological, and axiological conflicts by using a pragmatic approach. By doing so, it enhances the reliability and validity of research findings and offers a practical roadmap for novice researchers.

## First-Principle Analysis

### Fundamental Concepts
1. **Mixed-Methods Research**: Combines QUAL and QUAN approaches to provide holistic insights.
2. **Explanatory Sequential Design**: Involves collecting QUAN data first and then QUAL data to explain QUAN findings more elaborately.
3. **Pragmatism**: Advocates using the most effective research methods to answer specific research questions, regardless of traditional methodological boundaries.

### Methodology Evaluation
1. **Support for Research Question**: The methodology is robust in providing a comprehensive explanation of the explanatory sequential design in mixed methods, which directly supports the research question.
2. **Statistical Significance and Meaningfulness**: The paper focuses more on methodological rigor than on specific empirical results, thus not detailing statistical significance directly but emphasizing the theoretical soundness.
3. **Logical Conclusions**: The conclusions follow logically from the methodology and philosophical justifications provided.
4. **Strengths and Limitations**:
   - Strengths: Detailed explanation, practical guidelines, and comprehensive coverage of ethical issues and quality of inference.
   - Limitations: Lack of detailed empirical examples to showcase the actual application of the methodology in studies.

## Evaluation of the Paper

### Contribution to the Field
The paper significantly enhances the understanding and application of mixed-method designs, especially explanatory sequential designs, in educational research. It provides philosophical grounding and practical guidelines that are crucial for novice researchers.

### Real-World Applications
The implications are vast for educational researchers who often deal with complex phenomena. By advocating the explanatory sequential design, the paper enables more nuanced and comprehensive research practices that can inform educational policies and classroom practices.

### Ethical Considerations
The paper addresses ethical concerns related to mixed-method research comprehensively, ensuring that researchers are aware of the potential ethical pitfalls and how to navigate them.

### Further Research Directions
- Empirical studies showcasing the application of the explanatory sequential design in different educational contexts.
- Exploration of the challenges and solutions in integrating QUAL and QUAN data in real-world research scenarios.

## Critical Assessment

### Strengths
1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Thorough exploration of mixed-method designs, with a focus on the explanatory sequential design.
2. **Practical Guidelines**: Clear and actionable steps for novice researchers.
3. **Philosophical Justification**: Strong grounding in pragmatism, providing a robust theoretical framework.

### Weaknesses
1. **Lack of Empirical Examples**: The paper could benefit from more practical examples that illustrate the application of the explanatory sequential design.
2. **Implementation Challenges**: While the methodological guidelines are clear, real-world challenges and their solutions could be discussed more extensively.

### Future Research Directions
1. **Empirical Validation**: Conducting empirical studies to validate the theoretical claims made about the explanatory sequential design.
2. **Adaptation in Diverse Contexts**: Exploring how the mixed-method designs can be adapted across different educational settings and cultural contexts.
3. **Longitudinal Studies**: Investigating the long-term impact of using mixed-method designs on the quality and impact of educational research.

## Conclusion
The paper "Explanatory Sequential Mixed Method Design as the Third Research Community of Knowledge Claim" by Dhanapati Subedi offers a significant contribution to the field of educational research by detailing the theoretical and practical aspects of mixed-method designs, particularly the explanatory sequential approach. By addressing philosophical, methodological, ethical, and pedagogical aspects comprehensively, it provides a valuable resource for novice researchers. However, the inclusion of more empirical examples would further strengthen its practical utility. The potential impact of this research lies in its ability to guide researchers toward more holistic and accurate representations of complex educational phenomena.
