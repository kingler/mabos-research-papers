Abstract: Within business games there is a need to provide realistic feedback for decisions made, if such busi-
ness games are to continue to remain relevant in increasingly complex business environments. We address this
problem by using so/f_tware agents to simulate individuals and to model their actions in response to business
decisions. In our initial studies we have used so/f_tware agents to simulate consumers who make buying de-
cisions based on their private preferences and those prevalent within their social network. This approach can
be applied to search for behavioural patterns in social structures and to verify predicted values based on a priori
theoretical considerations. Individual behaviour can be modelled for each agent and its eﬀects within the mar-
ketplace can be examined by running simulations. Our simulations are founded upon the BDI so/f_tware model
(belief-desire-intention) combined with ontologies to make world knowledge available to the agents which can
then determine their actions in accordance with this knowledge. We demonstrate how ontologies can be integ-
rated into the BDI concept utilising the Jadex agent framework. Our examples are based upon the simulation
of market mechanisms within the context of diﬀerent industries. We use a framework, developed previously,
known as AGADE within which each agent evolves its knowledge using an ontology maintained during the sim-
ulation. This generic approach allows the simulation of various consumer scenarios which can be modelled by
creating appropriate ontologies.

Introduction
Motivation
/one.pnum./one.pnum Business games are an important tool for teaching students the consequences of decision making within a busi-
ness context. In a business game environment players determine sequences of activities e.g. producing a cer-
tain quantity of products with a given set of features, a pricing strategy or a marketing budget. Decisions are
governed by constraints within the game scenario such as restricted budget or limited production capacities.
The business game then evaluates the input of the players and presents feedback detailing the eﬀect of the
decision. Such feedback will typically be an estimate of the quantity of products sold, the market share and the
resulting profit/loss. The players take turns to interact with this model over a number of iterations in which the
model computes likely sales figures for the product portfolios oﬀered by the companies under simulation.
Problem
/one.pnum./two.pnum Simulation of real world scenarios in business games is an important application of complex adaptive social
systems. These complex adaptive systems will gain more and more importance and the science of complexity
will become one of the core disciplines of the future. Current business games do not give suﬀicient feedback to

the participants to draw conclusions on cause and eﬀect. The underlying models are based on sets of diﬀerence
or diﬀerential equations (see Forrester /one.pnum/nine.pnum/nine.pnum/zero.pnum, in his System Dynamics approach) or other methods that emphas-
ise quantitative aspects (see Gros /two.pnum/zero.pnum/zero.pnum/eight.pnum). Agents are a far more natural instrument to model complex dynamic
systems as they allow to directly model individual behaviour which in consequence leads to system wide ef-
fects. A restructuring of the representational infrastructure of complex social systems has occurred as Wilensky
& Rand (/two.pnum/zero.pnum/one.pnum/five.pnum) put forth and this will in consequence have an impact on the quality of business simulations.
Idea
/one.pnum./three.pnum The eﬀectiveness of a business game as an educational tool depends entirely on its feasibility to real world
scenarios and on the instant feedback provided by the game which should both appear as realistic as possible
(see Kaynak et al. /two.pnum/zero.pnum/one.pnum/two.pnum; Baldissin et al. /two.pnum/zero.pnum/one.pnum/three.pnum). The more realistic the model the more valuable the educational
experience. In our scenario we assume that the business game involves specifying, producing and pricing a
consumer product which is then released into a marketplace for sale. Products perceived as desirable will out-
sell those perceived as less attractive. We propose that realistic simulation of a consumer marketplace can be
achieved by the use of agents to model consumer behaviour and communication.
/one.pnum./four.pnum According to classical definitions, agent-based models consist of agents that are autonomous computational
individuals interacting with each other and their environment. They are active as well as reactive: external
stimuli, internal state and available information are used to determine actions an agent performs to reach given
goals. Agents are particularly well suited to represent social actors in complex environments which we use as a
basis for our approach to build business games.
/one.pnum./five.pnum A conceptual framework that guides agent activities is the BDI model which is a well established paradigm for
the development of agents (Bratman /one.pnum/nine.pnum/nine.pnum/nine.pnum). A BDI agent has knowledge about its world (beliefs) and pursues
goals (desires) while following given strategies (intentions). Therefore, the agent’s belief base stores everything
an agent knows (or believes to know) about the environment it lives and acts in. This knowledge is used to
model an image of the relevant world with all required elements that exist and how these elements are related
to each other.
Contribution
/one.pnum./six.pnum Agents must be able to act according to their knowledge of their internal and external world which must there-
fore be expressed in an appropriate format. Standardised formal languages to represent knowledge are avail-
able now and can be used to model knowledge of an agent in so called ontologies. They can be used to equip
agents acting in a simulation with personalised knowledge and learning capabilities. The idea of supporting
communities of agents with ontologies which describe the objects involved in the interactions of the agents
was originally formulated by Gruber (/one.pnum/nine.pnum/nine.pnum/three.pnum) and has subsequently been discussed by various other authors (e.g.
Hadzic /two.pnum/zero.pnum/zero.pnum/nine.pnum). Currently, frameworks mostly just perform syntactic matchings to detect analogies between data
exchanged during the communication process of a simulation (Hadzic /two.pnum/zero.pnum/zero.pnum/nine.pnum, pp. /one.pnum–/three.pnum/five.pnum). Strong and well de-
signed connections between semantic technologies and multi-agent systems can have a significant eﬀect on
the quality of multi-agent simulations.
/one.pnum./seven.pnum By using a community of agents, we propose that the simulated market place can be made more realistic in its
feedback to player inputs. By using a complex structure with many agents making individual decisions based
on local criteria and the influence of other local agents, the responses should be suﬀiciently complex to model
market place behaviour. This complexity should encourage the student to focus on making realistic business
decisions instead of simply learning the game mechanisms.
/one.pnum./eight.pnum A major benefit of supplying agents with ontologies in modelling simulation scenarios is a shi/f_t in perspective
that separates modelling aspects from coding details and focusses on the model rather than on programming
details. This increases eﬀiciency and leads to a clearer separation of concerns.
/one.pnum./nine.pnum The contribution of this work is a framework that incorporates semantic technologies, network analysis al-
gorithms and agents to run business scenarios. Agile Agent Development Environment (AGADE) shows a prac-
tical integration of a multi-agent based system and semantic technologies for realistic modelling of individuals
participating in a dynamic market environment. It has been used to run simulations on a model of a mobile
phone market in which buyers base their buying decision on social influence. Therefore the agents were mod-
elled to follow the pattern of opinion leadership and the market development indeed developed as predicted
and produced the expected outcome (Farrenkopf et al. /two.pnum/zero.pnum/one.pnum/four.pnum). Additional behavioural patterns are presented in
Farrenkopf et al. (/two.pnum/zero.pnum/one.pnum/five.pnum).

Outline of the paper
/one.pnum./one.pnum/zero.pnum In Section /two.pnum we describe the multi-agent simulation tool AGADE that incorporates semantic technologies and
network analysis algorithms. It is a highly configurable tool that can run BDI agent simulations where agents
communicate with each other, have knowledge of their environment and act in structured social environments
(Farrenkopf et al. /two.pnum/zero.pnum/one.pnum/four.pnum). The combination of BDI agents and ontologies creates a new perspective for multi-
agent simulation scenarios by modelling agent knowledge with the help of semantic technologies. AGADE has
accomplished the integration of these semantic technologies and agent based systems following the BDI pat-
tern. We describe the integration of ontologies with BDI agents. For the development of a universally applicable
integration of semantic technologies and agent based systems the blueprint of a layered ontology architecture
is demonstrated.
/one.pnum./one.pnum/one.pnum In Section /three.pnum we describe the process of applying the underlying AGADE mechanisms to a business game scen-
ario. The scenario models the introduction of a new product into an existing marketplace, namely biofuel into
the saturated motor fuel market of Austria. We compare the results obtained using AGADE with simulation res-
ults published earlier. Subsequently, we allow two student groups to participate and assess their experience
when using the simulation. Section /four.pnum presents conclusions and future work.
Agents and Ontologies
/two.pnum./one.pnum In classical implementations of multi-agent systems following the BDI architectural pattern built with frame-
works such as Jadex, all aspects have to be coded using a conventional programming language (mostly Java).
AGADE also uses Jadex, being Java based it could therefore be seamlessly connected to the reasoning mech-
anisms of the ontologies. While the basic operations of agents are le/f_t in Java classes, we shi/f_t certain aspects
of the BDI agent into the ontology so that we can use declarative rule languages such as the ontology language
OWL (Web Ontology Language, W/three.pnumC OWL Working Group /two.pnum/zero.pnum/one.pnum/two.pnum). This leads to a strict separation of concerns
where epistemological definitions and rules can be separated from behavioural patterns which will still be im-
plemented in the underlying BDI framework. AGADE makes use of well established semantic technologies and
connects them to the BDI machinery. The use of ontologies serves two purposes in our approach: according to
Gruber’s classic postulate (/one.pnum/nine.pnum/nine.pnum/three.pnum) it defines a common vocabulary for communication and beyond that it allows
an abstraction of certain elements of the simulation. For example, simulating market mechanisms with typical
actors is structurally equivalent for diﬀerent markets. They diﬀer in detail only e.g. in the goods being traded
and specific behavioural patterns. Our approach described in detail below uses a three layer structure to exploit
these similarities.
/two.pnum./two.pnum OWL is a standardised general knowledge representation language in which we formulate what is called an on-
tology. Ontologies are used to declare facts (i.e. structural knowledge) and to define how conclusions can be
drawn (i.e. inference knowledge) by using available reasoning instruments. Formally, an ontology Ois a triple
(C;R;I)whereCis a set of concepts, Ra set of relations, and Ia set of individual objects. Concepts formally
denote subsets of objects. From a perspective of formal logic such subsets are the extension of concepts itself
while concepts define the intentional representation of the corresponding set of objects. An object that belongs
to a concept is called an instance of that concept. The elements of Rare relations (also called roles or object
properties, as they manifest the linking on the level of the instances) having subsets of Cas domain and range.
The extension of a role is then a set of pairs (c; d)withc; d2I. Additionally, instances can have data properties
through which they get linked to primitive data e.g. strings or numbers. Typically, ontologies are formulated
by means of description logics with diﬀering levels of expressiveness (Baader /two.pnum/zero.pnum/zero.pnum/three.pnum). Usually description logics
are proper subsets of first order logic where expressiveness has been traded for decidability. Inference know-
ledge is implicitly given by the underlying mechanisms of the available reasoning instruments. Here, we use
OWL and the rule language SWRL (Semantic Web Rule Language) both specified by W/three.pnumC (Horrocks et al. /two.pnum/zero.pnum/zero.pnum/four.pnum;
W/three.pnumC OWL Working Group /two.pnum/zero.pnum/one.pnum/two.pnum). Basically, SWRL is a tool used to define if-then rules expressed in terms of OWL
concepts.
/two.pnum./three.pnum Each agent is equipped with a personal reasoner and a private ontology which is accessed using the OWL API
(Horridge & Bechhofer /two.pnum/zero.pnum/one.pnum/one.pnum). Social aspects and information about internal aspects of the agent (e.g. its current
state) are mapped to the ontology (see Figure /one.pnum): the set of beliefs (i.e. knowledge), desires (i.e. goals) and
intentions (i.e. plans of how to reach the goals). Factual knowledge of the world of an agent is represented
by individuals and corresponding relations. Relations can be restricted by specifying domain and range. Data
properties link concepts and individuals to primitive data e.g. strings or numbers (i.e. the age of a person).

/two.pnum./four.pnum We propose a layered ontology in which domain knowledge can be hierarchically separated by its degree of
generality. Abstract general concepts (e.g. thing, person,...) are coded in the ADL (abstract domain layer) while
more specific elements (e.g. concepts of a certain market theory) belong to the SDL (specific domain layer).
Finally, individual beliefs and desires are included in the IDL (individual domain layer). While ADL and SDL are
shared by all agents and therefore ensure ontological commitment without which communication between
the agents would not be possible, IDL is private to each agent and thus will usually diﬀer from agent to agent.
Figure /two.pnum shows the three layers and ontologies are imported. Each IDL concept has to be a subconcept of one
ore more concepts defined either in SDL or ADL. As OWL allows ontologies to import other ontologies we can
use this to include the general ontologies into the more specific ones. From a mathematical point of view the
set of general concepts is a subset of the specific knowledge available to an agent. By separating knowledge
into layers, general control of the simulation is kept independent of specific terms of a given scenario. During
the process of communication, agents can exchange elements of their IDLs and learn new facts. Because of our
assumption that ADL and SDL are shared and IDL concepts are specialisations, they can easily be placed in the
taxonomy. A simple form of learning is incorporated this way.

/two.pnum./five.pnum We developed an AbstractOWLAgent Java class that describes fundamental elements of an OWL-BDI agent
required to participate in AGADE simulations. References and methods to maintain ontologies and trigger plans
are implemented here. Subclasses of AbstractOWLAgent are on the level of SDL and specify more concrete
aspects of an agent. Each agent is linked to an IDL in which its individual behaviour is defined. AGADE uses the
inference mechanisms of the ontology (implemented in a reasoner) to determine the actions an agent performs
to reach its goals (i.e. desires). In compliance with the Jadex framework, possible individual actions of an agent
have to be implemented as plans within the Java code that implements the agent. Jadex allows these plans
to either be represented as methods inside the Java class that implements the agent or alternatively as plain
Java classes which have to provide a so called plan body method. For reasons of flexibility and reusability we
decided to code plans as Java classes. The Java classes annotated as plans have a corresponding member of
concept AgentAction in the ontology. These links make facts and rules of the ontology accessible to the agents
in the Java code. The object property nextAgentAction (with domain Person , which is basically equivalent to
the set of agents, and range AgentAction ) together with a rule determines how the agent decides which plan
to chose next. The next agent actions are periodically triggered by the round-based management of AGADE.
/two.pnum./six.pnum On an abstract level AGADE (see Figure /three.pnum) comprises two diﬀerent kinds of BDI agents: a director type agent that
acts as a specifically marked coordinator for the simulation triggering the beginning of each new round and a
participant type that comprises any kind of agent participating in the simulation (i.e. consumer and seller).

/two.pnum./seven.pnum Each round (time step) of the simulation is structured into four phases with defined functionality and integration
into the BDI paradigm:
Control phase The director processes commands issued by the user during execution of the last round. GUI
components are updated.
Calculation phase The director tells each agent to make necessary calculations to update its internal state.
Socialisation phase Agents update their mutual relations and possibly build new connections to other agents.
Acting phase The next agent actions are triggered depending on the individual state of the agent and the res-
ults of rule evaluation.
/two.pnum./eight.pnum The ontology based belief base leads to a very flexible architecture, because important aspects of the agent do
not have to be coded statically any more but may instead be expressed in the rules of the ontology. In the next
section we describe a typical scenario and demonstrate how it can be implemented using AGADE.

ontology model.
Summary
/three.pnum./two.pnum Kiesling et. al. describe an agent-based model for the diﬀusion of a second generation biofuel product into
the Austrian market (Kiesling et al. /two.pnum/zero.pnum/one.pnum/zero.pnum). High initial investments in infrastructure are necessary to launch
biofuel into the fuel market, therefore considerable financial resources are at stake before a suﬀiciently large
share of the market can be conquered. This is why the simulation focusses on the crucial questions of whether
biofuel will be accepted by the market at all and to what extent consumers will actually use biofuel abandoning
their traditional choice. Kiesling prefers an agent-based model over alternative approaches because existing
mathematical models “do not distinguish between the individual characteristics of consumers and thus neglect
consumers’ heterogeneity with regard to preferences and behaviour” .
/three.pnum./three.pnum In the simulated fuel market each product is characterised along multiple dimensions using a variety of attrib-
utes such as price, quality, or environmental friendliness. Consumers estimate product characteristics based on
their limited individual level of information which is either fed by personal experience or by communication with
other individuals or advertising. Each agent represents a single consumer and acts in a social structure which
is constructed according to network theoretic algorithms e.g. preferential attachment or the Watts-Strogatz-
model (Scott /two.pnum/zero.pnum/one.pnum/two.pnum). Kiesling characterises the participating agents by a number of individual parameters among
which we find the so called innovative threshold . This is used to model individual innovativeness meaning the
willingness to adopt innovations e.g. prefer new products or new brands over established ones. Even if they
would profit from using biofuel instead of conventional fuel, consumers may still refuse to purchase it just be-
cause it is simply too new. They rather wait for others and their experiences. This fact is modelled by means
of the innovative threshold. According to Roger’s model of innovativeness (/two.pnum/zero.pnum/zero.pnum/three.pnum), this threshold can be used
to categorise the consumers into innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority, and laggards. More
parameters are available that describe the role of the individual as a target of communication and its individual
behaviour as a consumer. Each agent keeps an information level (short: info (p; a), for product pand agent a)
that may increase through communication with fellow agents or by being target of marketing activities. This
value automatically decreases over time as information is obsolescing if not updated. The driving behaviour of
an agent is modelled through a parameter that determines fuel consumption and in consequence the frequency
of stops at the filling station. Furthermore, the agent has a utility threshold that describes the level of utility a
product must have to be considered as a valid alternative. Product quality is modelled by the product quality
value (short: ppq(p; a), for product pand agent a) which reflects consumer experiences with the product. The
utility value describes the subjective utility a consumer ascribes to a product and determines product selection.
/three.pnum./four.pnum Agents decide to buy a new product only if the utility value of that product is higher than the utility threshold of
the agent. The utility value of a product pfor an agent ais calculated with the following utility function :
ut(a; p) = (1 price t(p))wa
1;t+price t(p)wa
2;t+ppqt(p; a)wa
3;t+info t(p; a)wa
4;t
where wi; ta0andP
i= 14wa
i;t= 1 for each agent aand each time period t. For brevity we omit the
index tmeaning that the proposition holds for each value of t. The weights are related to the price ( w1and
w2), the preference for high quality ( w3), and the readiness to buy renewable energy ( w4) which depends on
information.
/three.pnum./five.pnum The set of consumers is partitioned into four segments which is reflected in the four weights of the utility func-
tion:
price-sensitive consumers with emphasis on low prices (largest segment, /seven.pnum/zero.pnum percent) have a high value
forw1,w2= 0and low values for w3andw4
consumers with focus on high-quality (/one.pnum/five.pnum percent) high value for w3,w2= 0 and low values for w1and
w4
eco-consumers for which price or quality are less important than environmental friendliness (/one.pnum/zero.pnum percent)
high value for w4,w2= 0and low values for w1andw3

snob buyers looking for exclusive products taking high prices as a signal for high quality (smallest seg-
ment, /five.pnum percent) have a high value for w2,w1= 0and low values for w3andw4
/three.pnum./six.pnum Note that the sizes of the segments are estimations based on the description given by Kiesling. Agents are
assigned randomly to the segments.
/three.pnum./seven.pnum The dynamics of the permeation process of biofuel in the fuel market is modelled with three types of events
that can occur during a simulation: communication events ,need events and experience events . The events are
either triggered stochastically or periodically depending on their nature.
Communication events Communication events are generated on the set of agents and are used to model the
diﬀusion of information in the agent society. An agent is selected randomly and then decides again at
random which of its relations it chooses to communicate with. The number of such mutual communica-
tion events in a single round of the simulation is proportional to the number of neighbours of the agent
chosen. During the communication the agent with the lower information level adjusts this value accord-
ing to that of the communication counterpart following an influence factor defined on the connection in
the social network weighing the influence.
Need events Aneed event occurs whenever an agent encounters a deficit triggering a purchasing process. This
deficit is indicated when the fuel level falls below the fuel threshold of the agent. If the agent does not have
any knowledge about biofuel at all, conventional fuel is bought. Otherwise, the utility value of biofuel is
calculated and if the resulting value lies above the individual utility threshold, the agent chooses biofuel.
Experience events In between two need events an experience event occurs. Experience events model per-
sonal experiences with a product by directly updating the quality value of the product.
/three.pnum./eight.pnum Marketing activities are scheduled periodically to introduce new products and to spread information about es-
tablished products. Agents are selected randomly and have their information level updated. Note that besides
personal communication which follows the structure of the social environment (word of mouth and opinion
leadership) marketing activities are the second means to spread knowledge in the community.
Fuel market ontology
/three.pnum./nine.pnum While we can reuse the abstract domain layer (ADL) of our previous simulations (i.e. mobile phone market,
Farrenkopf et al. /two.pnum/zero.pnum/one.pnum/four.pnum, /two.pnum/zero.pnum/one.pnum/five.pnum) without changes, the specific domain layer ontology (SDL) has to be adapted to
describe the fuel market with its products and specific elements (see Figure /four.pnum). Furthermore, specific aspects
of agent behaviour have to be implemented in the individual ontologies of seller and consumer. In this pro-
cess abstract concepts have to be specialised by subconcepts (e.g. Person gets subconcepts FuelSeller and
FuelConsumer while Fuel becomes a subconcept of Product which again is a subconcept of Item ). The four
consumer segments (see Figure /four.pnum) are modelled as a value partition i.e. the set of consumers is the union of the
four disjoint subsets Price-sensitiveConsumer ,Quality-seekingConsumer ,Eco-Consumer and Snob-buyer that
are again modelled as subconcepts of Consumer (taken from SDL) and ValuePartition (taken from ADL). Relev-
ant variables such as fuel level, travel behaviour, and utility value are modelled as data properties (see Figure
/five.pnum) having the respective concepts as range.

/three.pnum./one.pnum/zero.pnum Besides containing the concepts of the market domain ontology, the IDLs define all relevant facts to model
the state as well as the individual behaviour of the agents making extensive use of SWRL rules. The following
example shows an SWRL rule that is used to determine the appropriate plan of a consumer agent for the next
simulation round. If the fuelLevelValue of consumer falls below its individual threshold, a need event is
triggered i.e. the next agent action will be set to NeedEventPlan by using ontology reasoning techniques. This
plan implements the process in which the product is chosen.

/three.pnum./one.pnum/one.pnum Note that although SWRL provides math built-ins that enable OWL reasoners to perform simple mathematical
operations, we implemented all numerical computations in Java and made them accessible to the ontology
through method calls. We preferred that, because the support of SWRL built-ins is limited and may cause SWRL
rules to loose decideability, which will let the reasoning mechanisms fail (Feng et al. /two.pnum/zero.pnum/one.pnum/zero.pnum).
/three.pnum./one.pnum/two.pnum Agents communicate with other agents (e.g. they exchange information about product details) and this com-
munication refers to knowledge items that belong to the IDL layer. For this reason, agents can exchange inform-
ation which contains concepts that may be totally new for the receiving agent. The agent may then add new
facts (e.g. information level of biofuel or price value) acquired through this information exchange into its belief
base. When incorporating a new concept into its IDL (e.g. introducing biofuel through a marketing campaign),
the agent can add the concept into its IDL in an appropriate way because of sharing SDL and ADL.
Parameters and results
/three.pnum./one.pnum/three.pnum Agents and their relations form a small world network of /three.pnum/zero.pnum/zero.pnum/zero.pnum/zero.pnum consumer agents and /one.pnum seller agent built with
preferential attachment according to the Barabási algorithm which builds the network iteratively by adding
nodes to an initial graph. The overall number of nodes was chosen due to limitations of the available hardware
(two quad core CPUs and /two.pnum/five.pnum/six.pnumGB RAM). We modified the original algorithm so that the resulting network is dir-
ected. The number of connections of a new node was set to 225. Any node that is connected to more than /three.pnum/zero.pnum/zero.pnum/zero.pnum
nodes is considered a hub. Due to the parameter settings of the network construction, approximately 1percent
of agents are hubs. The weight of the edges connecting nodes to a hub is randomly set to an opinion influence
value between /zero.pnum./eight.pnum and /one.pnum. This lets hubs act as opinion leaders who strongly influence buying decisions of other
consumers through communication events. Experience events for an agent occur randomly in each round a/f_ter
the first time the agent has bought biofuel.
/three.pnum./one.pnum/four.pnum The travel behaviour of an agent is represented by a stochastic variable which is initially calculated for each
agent and based on a normal distribution with a mean of 0:3and a standard deviation of 0:05. In each time
period the fuel level is reduced by this value. The individual threshold that leads to a stop at the filling station
(see above fuel level threshold ) is set to a random number between /zero.pnum (exclusive) and 0:20(inclusive). The price
value of biofuel is set to /one.pnum./two.pnum/zero.pnum eand the price value of fossil fuel is set to /one.pnum./zero.pnum/zero.pnum e.
/three.pnum./one.pnum/five.pnum Initially, fossil fuel is the only fuel consumers can buy. At the beginning of the simulation they are not even aware
that there is an alternative product such as biofuel. When biofuel is launched into the market, the seller agent
initiates marketing activities to spread information about the new product. Agents add this new information
to their private IDL. The timing of the product launch can be chosen arbitrarily. For comparison reasons with
Kiesling, we set that point in time to round /eight.pnum/five.pnum. However, this has no significant eﬀect on the curve progression,
but only shi/f_ts the graph on the time axis.
/three.pnum./one.pnum/six.pnum Marketing activities focus on increasing the information level of each agent within reach of the activity. A mar-
keting activity contains the variable information content value . This is set to a random value between 0and
1and models the amount of information that is carried by the activity. The amount of marketing activities is
limited to 1%of the overall number of participating agents in each period. Whenever an agent is reached by a
marketing activity, the information content value is added to biofuel information level of the agent. If an agent
is aﬀected by more than one marketing activity in one time period, the maximum of the information content
values of all activities will be added. As described above the decision of buying biofuel instead of fossil fuel
finally depends on the individual utility values and the individual thresholds.
Conclusion
/three.pnum./one.pnum/seven.pnum The time horizon was set to /four.pnum/zero.pnum/zero.pnum rounds (i.e. time periods) and a total of /one.pnum/zero.pnum/zero.pnum runs with varying random seeds.
As expected, the results (see Figure /six.pnum and Figure /seven.pnum) are very similar to Kiesling’s results. Diﬀerences occur be-
cause not all of Kiesling’s parameter settings were published with exact values. Reasonable assumptions were
made here. The results prove the principal applicability of our concept. Certainly, this scenario can be repro-
duced with other agent simulation frameworks likewise, but AGADE is more flexible and versatile in modelling
diﬀerent agent behaviour. Important aspects of the agents do not have to be coded statically any more but can
be declared with rules. We will now focus on the perspective of using AGADE as a business game. Users will
be enabled to selectively change parameter settings and explore the resulting eﬀects thus ultimately analysing
the problem space of the scenario by setting up a hypothesis and then run simulations against it. A learning
circle can be established by either accepting or rejecting the hypothesis leading to further refinements of the
assumptions or alternative claims. This point of view confirms to the theory of Firestone and McElroy which

states that organisations and individuals acquire knowledge through what they call decision execution cycles
(DEC) in which actions are based upon knowledge claims, which represent untested assumptions. The eﬀect
of the actions is then compared to the expectations and a possible gap is closed by adjusting the initial know-
ledge claim according to the results observed (Firestone /two.pnum/zero.pnum/zero.pnum/three.pnum). The theory is highly influenced by Karl Popper’s
epistemology (/one.pnum/nine.pnum/seven.pnum/nine.pnum).

Business Game Considerations
/three.pnum./one.pnum/six.pnum Business games are a specific typology of what is called a serious game. The concept combines business sim-
ulations and games to support management and entrepreneurial training (Baldissin et al. /two.pnum/zero.pnum/one.pnum/three.pnum, p. /three.pnum). Business
games are used as an educational mean to go beyond mere theoretical contemplation and to simulate prac-
tice. They provide students with the opportunity to develop decision-making skills and improve confidence in
situations of risk and uncertainty through the simulation of management practices across the enterprise in ever
more complex real-life contexts.
/three.pnum./one.pnum/seven.pnum We have described a scenario where marketing activities are crucial for placing a new product into a saturated
market. Here challenges certainly lie in a limited marketing budget and the predictability of the eﬀects of ap-
plied marketing means. The overall goal is of course to increase revenues. In this case business games will train
the ability to plan eﬀective campaigns that make optimal use of a given budget.
/three.pnum./one.pnum/eight.pnum Providing a user interface through which parameter settings can be modified during the simulation AGADE lets
users intervene in the simulations. Users can experiment with various settings and investigate strategies that
may accelerate the adoption of biofuel by the market and thus increase the market share. A/f_ter each period
users will receive feedback that describes the evolution of the market and can then draw conclusions. Users
can analyse and contemplate results and decide what to do in the next period. Note that existing equation-
based simulations usually do not present results to participants with real-time animations, as they can only
display the final output of equations at the end of each round. A possible action could be cutting consumer
prices which of course will have an impact on the sales figure and on the revenues. This impact will immediately
be reflected by the system and the calculations of the next round. A possible hypothesis to be tested is ’If you
win opinion leaders, you will convince their community as well’ . This hypothesis can be tested by simulating
target marketing (Weinstein /two.pnum/zero.pnum/one.pnum/three.pnum, pp. /one.pnum/three.pnum/three.pnum-/one.pnum/five.pnum/four.pnum), which can be done by identifying hubs in the social network
and observe how word-of-mouth mechanisms let information diﬀuse through the network. Social network
analysis can identify hubs by simply looking for agents with a high number of connections to fellow agents. As
finding opinion leaders in real world communities is diﬀicult and expensive estimating such eﬀects in a business
simulation is well worth the eﬀort.
/three.pnum./one.pnum/nine.pnum The simulation itself can be controlled through the GUI displayed in Fig. /eight.pnum. A simulation can be halted between
any two rounds by clicking the GUI control buttons located at the top so that further inspection of the current
state of aﬀairs is possible. Data describing crucial aspects of the current simulation is displayed continuously.
The right hand side of the screen is a visualisation of the social structure formed by all participating agents. The
vertices of the graph represent the agents using diﬀerent shapes for diﬀerent agent types. Size and colour of
the vertices can be used to display additional information on the respective agent (e.g. individual state). The
edges between the vertices visualise details about that relation and are labelled with the respective relation
indices (e.g. opinion influence level). Importantly, the social graph can be used to inspect the very mind of each
agent, as it allows to take a look at the current ontology state belonging to an agent of interest. The intention
of a consumer agent to refuel its car is indicated by setting the colour of the respective vertex to red. The user
interface control is displayed at the start of the simulation and then a/f_ter a predefined number of steps (see
Fig. /nine.pnum). At each stop the user can specify the amount of money to be invested in marketing activities in the next
rounds and select a marketing strategy (i.e. target marketing). Beyond the price of the product under obser-
vation (here biofuel) can be adjusted. The feature that the social graph and agent’s ontology is contentiously

/three.pnum./two.pnum/two.pnum We conducted an experiment with two restricted groups of students in the classroom (/one.pnum/zero.pnum first year bachelor’s
program students and /two.pnum/zero.pnum second year master’s program students, both business informatics) to investigate how
simulation settings respond to business decisions. Two groups of students with diﬀerent levels of knowledge
of the topic marketing and with diﬀerent levels of experience in the use of business games were selected. While
the first year bachelor students had never actively taken part in business games in the classroom before, the
master program students already had used and reflected their use and eﬀect (e.g. Topsim/one.pnumand Simultrain/two.pnum).
The experiment was divided into three phases: instructions, pre-experiment test and post-experiment test. The
instructions provided in the first phase described the purpose of the experiment and gave instructions on how
to use AGADE. The pre-experiment test consisted of questions about the law of demand and supply and other
questions regarding marketing eﬀects. The intention here was to establish a mental preparation of the test
persons towards the scenario of the game and eventually to assess the subjects’ knowledge about particular

user experience made a/f_ter running the simulation was to be measured. We used the usual /five.pnum-point Likert scale
from strongly disagree to strongly agree . The overall duration of the experiment was /nine.pnum/zero.pnum minutes. Table /one.pnum shows
the list of questions used.

/three.pnum./two.pnum/three.pnum In this section, we analyse the results of the questionnaire in Table /one.pnum of both student groups. Figure /one.pnum/zero.pnum compares
the mean values of the answers for both groups. Both student groups produced similar values in their answers
with the exception of question /one.pnum/zero.pnum. The significant lower value of the question /one.pnum/zero.pnum is due to the fact that it was a
first year student group which had not visited a marketing lecture yet. Based on these results, we claim that the
simulation responds to the decisions made by the users in a manner that is expected (see questions /one.pnum, /two.pnum and /five.pnum).
The figure shows that the scenario is principally applicable to be used for business simulations (q/three.pnum, q/four.pnum, q/six.pnum, q/seven.pnum,
q/eight.pnum, q/nine.pnum, q/one.pnum/one.pnum, q/one.pnum/two.pnum). Despite the diﬀerent levels of knowledge of both groups there are only slight diﬀerences in the
results. Note that both groups were made familiar with basic marketing theory. All in all, the simulation of the
consumer market was accepted as a valid model of reality and shows the applicability of the concept of using
ontology based BDI agents to model consumer behaviour and communication.

Conclusion and Future Work
/four.pnum./one.pnum Using ontologies to model agents can have a significant impact on the way agent oriented programming and
so/f_tware simulations work. With AGADE, we show how multi-agent based system and semantic technologies are
used to model individuals participating in a dynamic market environment. A three-layer ontology allows agents
to share knowledge and create a basic common understanding of their environment while enabling reuse of
fundamental concepts and simple learning mechanisms. Modelling and use of overall individual behaviour and
decision processes in simulations for diﬀerent scenarios which can be used in business games is demonstrated.

/four.pnum./two.pnum Assumptions about consumer behaviour, decision making, and eﬀects of social communities can also be put
into the models. This leads to a basis for running business games in which decision making and its eﬀects can
be simulated. The study of a scenario in which a new product is launched into a saturated market shows the
potential of the approach to be applied in more complex contexts.
/four.pnum./three.pnum Future research will complete the set of implemented behavioural patterns and make them available in busi-
ness games. Furthermore, we consider a domain specific language designed to both accelerate and facilitate
the development of powerful AGADE components. The degree of reuse that can be achieved will be investigated
and formalised.
