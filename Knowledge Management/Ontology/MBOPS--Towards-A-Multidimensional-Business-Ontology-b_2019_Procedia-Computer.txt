Abstract
In this paper, we propose a Multidimensional Business Ontol ogy based-Premodeling System ( MBOPS ). Its
knowledge-oriented core ensures an easier use and share for unambiguous business process modeling. Furthermore,
the proposed ( MBOPS ) guarantees a good understanding level for the modelled-do main familiar designers as well
as the modelled-domain non-familiar designers thanks to a M ultidimensional business ontology. In order to evaluate
the proposed ( MBPS ) and demonstrate its eﬀectiveness, we choice the breast can cer treatment protocols as an
applicative ﬁeld.

1. Introduction
Business process modeling requires an exhaustive descript ion of its components. It should be based on a
ﬁnite number of concepts that explain the related semantic d epending to the domain to be modeled thanks
to the added value that knowledge can bring to well describe b usiness. The use of ontology seems to be
a relevant way to explicitly present business knowledge in o rder to help users, in their tedious task, to
ﬁnd relevant knowledge corresponding, each time, to modeli ng needs. Moreover, the ontology is increasingly
used for modeling knowledge. It provides a theoretical and p ractical basis for robust modeling of a domain
[1]. Additionally, it improves the exchange of operational co ncepts from one study to another in the same
domain of interest. The ontology describes clear and consis tent semantic links between terms implicitly

and their relationships [ 2]. In the same spirit, this paper deals with an ontology-base d approach that the
objectives is to provide an easy way for designers to make the ir tasks. Indeed, we propose to extend the
business process life-cycle in adding a pre-modeling step t hat takes place just before the design step. In such
an additional step/phase, we suggest a set of knowledge orga nized around the three-main business process
perspectives to provide for designers exactly the needed kn owledge. In the literature, there are several works
use ontology to model speciﬁc domains such as [ 3] and [ 4]. These works are not generic and they do not deal
with diﬀerent dimensions of business knowledge, so they can not be consistent in our ﬁeld.
The present paper is organized as follows. Section 2gives a scoop of the application domain which relevant
to a very delicate one. Section 3presents our contribution which is decomposed in two main di rectives:
(i) Multidimensional Domain-Speciﬁc Ontology constructi on and (ii) Business Rules elaboration. Section 4
demonstrates the proposed framework MBOPS. Section 5discuses some related work. Finally, a conclusion
is provided in section 6with a number of suggestions for future work.
2. Motivating Example: Breast Cancer (BC) treatment protoc ols
Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) practic ally take part in all business domains. Health-
care domain, which is considered one of the largest business domains in the world, was also beneﬁts from the
ICT impact especially as it is a large-speciality domain. Si nce nothing is more precious than a human life,
in this section, we choose to treat a real practical scenario that touches the human life. It is cancer, more
precisely breast cancer which is classiﬁed as a dangerous di sease. The analysis and the treatment protocols
of such a disease require a large actors from diﬀerent specialities. Referring to the American Cancer Society
(ACS),1, breast cancer treatment processes are characterized by highly dynamic, unpredictable, complex
and highly intensive knowledge actions. Knowledge have a pa rticular interest because an evil knowledge use
can has a very expensive result especially when talking abou t the loss of a human life.
The overall care process of the women with breast cancer is co mposed of several sub-processes which made
up of a succession of many actions in the form of medical analy sis and evaluation situations involving various
delicate specialities. It calls up very important and heter ogeneous knowledge types. Many medical informa-
tion and knowledge related to results of clinical exams and h ospitalization reports are used and created
during these BPs. For a specialist or a domain expert, to pred ict a case-speciﬁc breast cancer treatment
protocol process, is not awfully a hard task but, in reality, the predicted process does not perforce be the
same of that of another specialist. Indeed, this variety can led to several problems of knowledge sharing and
reuse. So, how is the case of a non specialist that has as task to model suc h a complex process ?
Our prominent objective is to identify, make visible, preserve, share and generate t he diﬀerent dimensions
of medical knowledge for modeling the medical care process o f patient with BC. This lead to resolve the
semantic ambiguity in business process modeling since mode lers can have fuzzy visions to the activities
linking (which activities should be chosen) and even to assi gn the activity to the appropriate actors (How
can accomplish one activity?)
In the matter that a woman remarks that there is a change in her breast shape, the process of BC treatment
will be triggered. A breast cancer specialist discusses wit h her, relevant to her situation, about the protocols
of BC treatment and makes the appropriate treatment decisio n. Related to the decision, the patient partic-
ipates in a clinical trial and here a medical report check mus t be performed. In accordance with the results
of medical reports, there are three choices related to some c onditions (i) no treatment at all, (ii) stop the
treatment, (iii) takes a treatment. In the last case, sub-pr ocesses can take place involving diﬀerent actors.
Chemotherapy treatment involves a chemotherapist or medic al oncologist, radiation treatment involves ra-
diation oncologist, surgical treatment involves a surgeon and other treatments. As an example, in the above
description, for the activity related to choice a treatment , the modeler can allocate it to a chemotherapist,
medical oncologist or radiation oncologist. Here, three di ﬀerent roles can be constructed in the business

3. MBO: A Multidimensional Business Ontology
Business processes play a crucial role in the organizations given that they represent the manner in which
work is organized, coordinated, and focused to produce a val uable product or service. In fact, to be more
competitive and to react as fast as possible to the clients’ requirements, the organizations give more impor-
tance to the management of their business processes. Indeed, the business process management (BPM) refersto methods, techniques, and tools that support the design, m anagement, and analysis of business processes
that are the diﬀerent levels of BPM life cycle [ 5]. In addition, when treating with these levels, designers
must deal with many pieces of information in order to well rep resent the activities to improve the overall
performance of the organizations. Furthermore, the key-id ea is to create business process models so as to be
share and reusable when needed. In this way, problems of unde rstanding are provided because designers have
not the same visions and ideas. Simply, they have diﬀerent skills, manner of understanding and explaining
given that this is graved in their memory and their work habit s. In fact, this diversity of skills and manner
can product lots of problems in an understanding level. Henc e, our approach is considered as a solution to
limit modeling problems. Figure 2summarizes the main issue and the presents the proposed solu tion. The
key objective of our proposed solution is to facilitate the d esigner’s tasks by making at their disposal A
Multidimensional Business Ontology based-Premodeling System ( MBOPS ). The core of the MBOPS is a
Multidimensional Business Ontology (MBO) since ontology p rovides a much appreciated-semantic signiﬁ-
cance for speciﬁc domain, thanks to their ability to share an d reuse pieces of knowledge. Business domain
is such a delicate domain. [6 ]. In the scope of the ontology, the main role is to describe kn owledge using
terms deﬁnitions and axioms related to a speciﬁc domain that has ever been investigated and analyzed for
conceptual modeling [ 7]. MBO is divided into two phases as demonstrated in ﬁgure 2. Phase 1 addresses the
construction of a multidimensional domain-speciﬁc domain and phase 2 addresses business rules elaboration.
Concerning the ﬁrst phase, business process models are empl oyed to capture business knowledge and divide
them into dimensions organized around the business process key-perspectives. To formally present these
dimensions, a model to model (M2M) transformation is applie d to formalize concepts of each dimension andFig. 2: The Proposed Approach.

Constructing a domain speciﬁc ontology from scratch by hand , or from textual description is not such an

existing business process models are an interesting suppor t to extract the key business concepts and to
explicit the exiting relationships.

to model a speciﬁc domain describing a part of the world. It re presents the particular meanings of terms as
they apply to that domain [ 10].

as to clarify the business process modeling. In this matter, seven dimensions of business knowledge are
deﬁned [ 8] notably, the organizational dimension, the informationa l dimension, the functional dimension,
the operational dimension, the conditional dimension, the behavioral dimension and ﬁnally the skill. These
dimensions are organized around the three-key business pro cess perspectives as it is depicted in ﬁgure 2(c).

In essence, a transformation has been proposed in [ 8] founded on a model to model transformation in
proposing a Multidimensional Business Knowledge Model (MBKM). The MBKM represents each dimension
with their related business concepts. So, the transformati on had been based on a mapping among a set of
BPMN models to determinate their MBKM corresponding in a met a-modeling level [ 11] as it is depicted in

Semantic relationships (SR) have an important role as much a s the business concepts due to their logical-link
description between the diﬀerent concepts. The SR determin ation is absolutely logic and semantic task for
which a misunderstanding of the business domain can lead to m any modeling problems. In this matter,
ﬂowing the same directives of BC determination, we opt to a mo del to model transformation based on the
BPMN existing models. Besides, referring to the BPMN meta-m odel, the connecting objects especially the
sequence ﬂow on the one hand, and on the other hand, the ﬂow obj ects are the key elements of which we
have used to detect the semantic relationships. In studying the BPMN elements, we have remarked that
each element has one or more incomingport and one or more outg oingport except some event types like
start event and the end event. For that, in referring to the de scription of the elements’ ports, each outgoing
port is closely related to an incoming port and vice versa. In follows, we outline some semantic relationship
determination.
-Event corresponding semantic relationship: Concerning the Event, in this research, we have chosen to
be limited to respectively present the start and the end even t related semantic relationship among the
51 types of event in the BPMN.
E is an event, Bc is a business concept, Se is a Start event, Se is an end event and act is a business
process activity. If the Event E has only an outgoingPort the n E is a Start Event SE.
If the Se.outgoingPort is corresponding an act.incomingPo rt then
Create a Semantic Relationship SR where the SR.name is "Trigger ".
The SR.source element (Domain) is the BC related to Se and
The SR.target element (Range) is the BC related to act.
SR is BC SeTrigger BCact
If the Event E has only an incomingPort then E is an end Event Ee .
If the Ee.incomingPort is corresponding an act.outgoingPo rt then
Create a Semantic Relationship SR where the SR.name is "End ".
The SR.source element (Domain) is the BC related to act and
The SR.target element (Range) is the BC related to Ee.
SR is BC EeEnd BCact
-Sequential semantic relationship: The business process elements are related together using co nnecting
objects. Moreover, the key connecting-object element is th e sequence follows which are deﬁned as sub-
stantial links within a process. The Sequence ﬂow ensures th e connexions between the BPMN elements,whether between activities themselves, activities and gat eways and even gateways themselves. Based
on the same principle of the communicating port in addition t o a speciﬁc sequence ﬂow description
(targetRef and sourceRef), we outline the manner in which th e SR is de terminated.
act is a business process activity and SeqF is a BPMN sequence ﬂow.
If SeqF.targetRef is related to act then For all activities i n the process do
If act i.outgoingPort = SeqF.sourceRef And act i+1.incomingPort = SeqF.targetRef then
create a Semantic Relationship where SR.name is "Follow "
The SR.source element (Domain) is related to the BCact i+1
The SR.target element (Range) is related to the BCact i
SR is BCact i+1Follow BCact i
3.2. Business Rules
The execution of business logic is missing in MDO, which makes it a static representation of speciﬁc
business concepts and their relationships. The business lo gic is expressed throughout a set of business rules
[12]. Business rules are high-level structured declarations t hat provide a good way to constrain, control and
inﬂuence a business aspect. Also, that can decrease or incre ase the risk impact, and even, make rational
decisions [13 ]. In bellow, we have chosen to simply present diﬀerent segme nts of business rules separately to
facilitate their presentation, their readability, and the ir understanding. Table 1resumes some business rules.
4. MBOPS: A Multidimensional Business Ontology based-Prem odeling System
Implementation . At this level, we depict the implementation phase of the pro posed environment which
mainly contains three modules for which we will detail their operation, deﬁning the technical choices of their
realization, and the used API. MBOPS is a design-helping system dedicated to business process designers.
MBOPS, based on business ontology, gives a business vision s emantically clear and rich. As ﬁgure 3depicts,
it is a three-module system that the ﬁrst one is Filling Ontol ogy, the second is Rule execution and the third
is Premodeling of BP.
-Filling Ontology module : The main functions of this module are access to the populati on interface
of concepts from the process perspective, from the organizational perspective and equally from theinformational perspective. The purpose of the module, with the various interfaces, allows designers to
add new instances as they go when they consult MBOPS for the mo deling of their business processes.
Indeed, the process of ﬁlling in the knowledge base interfac e starts with choosing the business process
perspective, secondly, selecting the knowledge dimension , and third, choosing the concept that the
designer wants to add. For implementing new instances to the ontology, we have chosen Protégé
2
that is automatically applied in this module. Protégé, is co nsidered as the most used ontology editing
environment that provides the ontology management notably the ontology building [ 14]. It provides an
easy way to create new classes, manage instances and even deﬁ ne properties [ 15]. Java and API-JENA
are applied to implement this module3.
-Rule Execution module : The main function of this module is to access to the list of bu siness rules
already deﬁned in order to allocate for each dimension the po ssible logic combination, as an example
the list of activities with the necessary role to carry out ea ch activity. The used language to execute
this module is the SWRL (Semantic Web Rule Language)4. SWRL is a W3C standardized language

as to clarify the business process modeling. In this matter, seven dimensions of business knowledge are
deﬁned [ 8] notably, the organizational dimension, the informationa l dimension, the functional dimension,
the operational dimension, the conditional dimension, the behavioral dimension and ﬁnally the skill. These
dimensions are organized around the three-key business pro cess perspectives as it is depicted in ﬁgure 2(c).
BK = {Fun_K, Op_K, Beh_K, Con_K, Org_K, SK, InfR_K }
In essence, a transformation has been proposed in [ 8] founded on a model to model transformation in
proposing a Multidimensional Business Knowledge Model (MBKM). The MBKM represents each dimension
with their related business concepts. So, the transformati on had been based on a mapping among a set of
BPMN models to determinate their MBKM corresponding in a met a-modeling level [ 11] as it is depicted in
ﬁgure 2(c).
Deﬁnition 2 : MBKM is deﬁned as a set of Business Knowledge (BK) that are, i n turn, a set of business
concepts (BC) and a set of semantic relationships (SR).

5. Related Work
Researches related to business process modeling did not cea se ever through the years. The most empha-
sized interest is that of business process modeling quality improving. Indeed, researchers had been focused
their studies on treating the semantic hidden behind the bus iness process models. For that, several ap-
proaches had taken part to resolve the modeling ambiguities that designers can meet during the design
phase of the business process life-cycle [ 17]. These ambiguities have two formats whether structural or se-
mantic. Concerning the structural pitfalls, several studi es had succeed to resolve this issue but did not
succeed to resolve the semantic pitfalls [ 21] and [ 22]. On the other hand, other studies had succeed in treat-
ing the semantic issues, but their eﬀorts still limited to im prove the business process model semantics as
an example, we can cite [ 23], [24] and [ 25]. Ontologies had evenly contributed to resolve the semanti c issues
by focusing on domain knowledge modeling for business proce ss management, as an instance, we can cite
[26] and [ 7]. Despite the eﬀorts made in this direction, these research es had, on the one hand, succeed to
partially resolve the semantic pitfalls and, on the other ha nd, unfortunately, they had contributed to facili-
tating the automation and the veriﬁcation of the business pr ocess models rather than the task of designing
them. In this regard, we believe that our solution is unique b ecause it is a bi-directional solution since it
deals with, both, structural and semantic ambiguities: str uctural ambiguities are treated by ensuring an
automatic generation of the model and semantic ambiguities are treated by making available at the disposal
of the designers a multidimensional business knowledge bas e.
6. Conclusion and Future Work
The diﬀerence of the designers skills and their ability to un derstand and describe real phenomena, leads
to several ambiguities. In this work, we proposed an ontolog ical approach to create a multidimensional
business knowledge base so as to help, at an early stage, busi ness process designers in their tasks. Building
an ontology for a vast domain as a whole, such is the case of the medical domain, is not straightforward, but
likewise we envisaged to build a multidimensional business ontology starting from existing business process
models by determining the business concepts and likewise th e determination of the semantic relationship. In
this spirit, we equally proposed a set of business rules that describe the business logic whose their role is to
guarantee the reasonable allocation of the business concep t and the semantic relationship. Indeed the MBO
has been evaluated using three-type evaluation (i) syntact ical, (i) qualitative and (iii) qualitative. Besides,
we proposed MBOPS as a framework to ensure the performance of the proposed solution and we chose as an
application domain the processes related to the breast canc er treatment. As a future direction, we envisaged,
on the one hand, to not be limited to the basic elements of BPMN but to proceed to the treatment of theextended elements of BPMN in order to determinate new semant ic relationship. On the other hand, from a
practical view, we envisaged to generalize the MBO to suppor t other medical domains.

following numbers in terms of instances for each concept of t he populated ontology. The table 2depicts some
numbers in this direction. Concerning the syntactical assessment, the generated model had been executed
throughout speciﬁc BPM software without errors. Regarding the qualitative, we made use of an oncologist
to assess the model generated through our MBO.
5. Related Work
Researches related to business process modeling did not cea se ever through the years. The most empha-
sized interest is that of business process modeling quality improving. Indeed, researchers had been focused
their studies on treating the semantic hidden behind the bus iness process models. For that, several ap-
proaches had taken part to resolve the modeling ambiguities that designers can meet during the design
phase of the business process life-cycle [ 17]. These ambiguities have two formats whether structural or se-
mantic. Concerning the structural pitfalls, several studi es had succeed to resolve this issue but did not
succeed to resolve the semantic pitfalls [ 21] and [ 22]. On the other hand, other studies had succeed in treat-
ing the semantic issues, but their eﬀorts still limited to im prove the business process model semantics as
an example, we can cite [ 23], [24] and [ 25]. Ontologies had evenly contributed to resolve the semanti c issues
by focusing on domain knowledge modeling for business proce ss management, as an instance, we can cite
[26] and [ 7]. Despite the eﬀorts made in this direction, these research es had, on the one hand, succeed to
partially resolve the semantic pitfalls and, on the other ha nd, unfortunately, they had contributed to facili-
tating the automation and the veriﬁcation of the business pr ocess models rather than the task of designing
them. In this regard, we believe that our solution is unique b ecause it is a bi-directional solution since it
deals with, both, structural and semantic ambiguities: str uctural ambiguities are treated by ensuring an
automatic generation of the model and semantic ambiguities are treated by making available at the disposal
of the designers a multidimensional business knowledge bas e.
6. Conclusion and Future Work
The diﬀerence of the designers skills and their ability to un derstand and describe real phenomena, leads
to several ambiguities. In this work, we proposed an ontolog ical approach to create a multidimensional
business knowledge base so as to help, at an early stage, busi ness process designers in their tasks. Building
an ontology for a vast domain as a whole, such is the case of the medical domain, is not straightforward, but
likewise we envisaged to build a multidimensional business ontology starting from existing business process
models by determining the business concepts and likewise th e determination of the semantic relationship. In
this spirit, we equally proposed a set of business rules that describe the business logic whose their role is to
guarantee the reasonable allocation of the business concep t and the semantic relationship. Indeed the MBO
has been evaluated using three-type evaluation (i) syntact ical, (i) qualitative and (iii) qualitative. Besides,
we proposed MBOPS as a framework to ensure the performance of the proposed solution and we chose as an
application domain the processes related to the breast canc er treatment. As a future direction, we envisaged,
on the one hand, to not be limited to the basic elements of BPMN but to proceed to the treatment of theextended elements of BPMN in order to determinate new semant ic relationship. On the other hand, from a
practical view, we envisaged to generalize the MBO to suppor t other medical domains.
