Many decision tables are too technical. They are 
aimed at software developers, not business 
people. Do they have to be that way?  
No. Our approach, TableSpeak , stays as close as 
possible to formats intuitive and natural for 
business people. TableSpeak  does not require 
business people or business analysts to:  
• Learn any special new format and related 
conventions.  
• Use a single format even if not optimal for a 
given problem.  
TableSpeak is : 
• Aimed at supporting ongoing coordination 
of operational business decisions .  
• A natural follow -on to DecisionSpeak1, our 
top-down approach for business -oriented 
decision analysis . 
• Like DecisionSpeak, a part of the 
comprehensive BRS methodology, IPSpeak®. 
TableSpeak emphasizes:  
• Deliberate structure, to ensure business -
friendly representation of decision logic  and 
on-target implementation.  
• Careful communication of meaning, to 
avoid a mbiguity and misinterpretation.  
• Prote ctions for the integrity (correctness) of 
content, to avoid faulty decisions.  
                                                           
1 Decision Analysis: A Primer – How to Use 
DecisionSpeak™ and Question Charts (Q -Charts™):  
http://www.brsolutions.com/IPSpeakPrimers   • Declarative  representation, to ensure 
decision logic  remains platform -
independent and highly re -usable.  
• Single -sourcing , to ensure that any given 
specification will be as easy a s possible to 
find and to change quickly and reliably.  
Refer to Appendix 1 for a quick overview of 
TableSpeak . 
Decision tables are by no means a perfect form 
of representation, nor can they be used for a 
great many business rules . They are not a silver 
bullet. Be aware that:  
• Some styles of decision table design prove 
better than others.  
• You will likely  need automated support for 
thorough analysis of larger  decision tables.  
Used correctly, however, decision tables can be 
extremely useful in representing, analyzing, 
implementing, and managing certain forms of 
know -how . They fit handily with many 
implementation platforms, including de cision 
management systems. They provide significant 
opportunities for ROI.  
We believe decision tables are a key technique 
for business analysis.  This discussion introduces 
you to everything you need to know about 
understanding and desi gning decision tables .

Decision Tables : A Primer – How to Use Table SpeakTM 
 
© 2013 Business Ru le Solutions, LLC. www.BRSolutions.com . All rights reserved.   7 / 121 PART 1 : THE BASICS OF DECISION  TABLES
1.1 WHAT A DECISION TABLE IS  
A decision  is a determination requiring know -
how  or expertise; the resolving of a question by 
identifying some correct or optimal choice .  
A decision should represent  the best or most 
appropriate  answer (outcome) among potential 
outcomes for some weighty (non -trivial) choice 
the business must make repetitively in day -to-
day business activity.  
Decisions appropriate for decision analysis  are 
always operational business decisions  – not 
programming, perso nal, strategic, or 
governance decisions. To emphasize the point, 
this Primer always says operational business 
decision , not simply decision .2  
Decision tables  are an excellent means to 
represent the decision rules  on which an 
operational business decision is based.  
Be fully aware, however, that decision tables 
cannot be used to capture a great many 
business rules.3 Don’t be misled in that regard.  
                                                           
2 There is much confusion in the field on this point . 
The practitioner is urged to carefully review the 
important target -problem clarifications presented in 
Appendix 2 of the companion Primer on 
DecisionSpeak .  
http: //www.brsolutions.com/IPSpeakPrimers  
3 Refer to Appendix 3 of the companion Primer on 
DecisionSpeak regarding  the distinction between 
decision rules and other important kinds of business 
rules  that need to be capture d and manage d.  
http://www.brsolutions.com/IPSpeakPrimers  1.1.1  The Question a Decision Table Addresses  
An example of a simple decision table  is 
presented in Figure P1 -1. This decision table 
addresses the question What coat should be 
worn?.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
The decision table in Figure P1.1 can be used to 
answer four specific variations of the question  
What coat should be worn? , as follows.  
1. What coat should be worn if it is cold 
and rainy ? 
2. What coat should be worn  if it is cold 
and not rainy?  
3. What coat should be worn  if it is not 
cold and not rainy?  
4. What coat should be  worn if it is not 
cold but rainy?  
The answers can be found in the appropriate 
intersection cells (for convenience, lightly  
colored), starting at the top row on the left, 
then reading clockwise.   Yes, it’s 
rainy  No, it’s 
not rainy  
Yes, it’s 
cold  lined  
raincoat  wool 
overcoat  
No, it’s 
not cold  unlined 
raincoat  none  Is it rainy?  
 
Is it cold?  Figure P1 -1.

Part 1 : The Basics of Decision Tables  
© 2013 Business Rule Solutions, LLC. www.BRSolutions.com . All rights reserved.   8 / 121 1.1.2 Decision Rules  and Outcomes  
The answers to the four specific questions 
above represent four decision rules , which 
could be expressed as follows.  
1. A lined raincoat  should be worn i f it is 
cold and rainy.  
2. A wool overcoat  should be worn if it is 
cold and not rainy.  
3. A coat need not  be worn if it is not cold 
and not rainy.  
4. An unlined raincoat  should be  worn if it 
is not cold but rainy . 
A decision rule  is a business rule  that guides 
the making of an  operational business decision,  
a business rule  that provides a specific answer 
to a selective question .  
A significant benefit of using decision tables is 
that there is no need to write out the decision 
rules as above (unless desired for clari fication). 
Appropriate outcomes simply appear in the 
decision cells  of the decision table.  
An outcome  is the result, conclusion  or answer  
given by a decision rule to a selective question 
being asked. Example:  
Lined raincoat  is the outcome given by the 
decision rule A lined raincoat should be 
worn if it is cold and rainy.  
The outcome given by a decision rule is selected 
from among a set of potential outcomes , all the 
individual outcomes permitted for answering 
the overall question. Potential outcomes for t he 
decision table in Figure P 1-1 include at least:  
1. lined raincoat  
2. wool overcoat  3. no coat (none)  
4. unlined raincoat  
Other potential outcomes might exist besides 
these four. Identifying the complete set of 
potential outcomes is always an important 
concern in d ecision analysis.  
Incidentally, did you notice that none  is not a 
coat!? For discussion of that interesting word 
refer to Appendix 7 .  
1.1.3 What a Decision Table Is  
What  is a decision table?  
A decision table  is simply  a structured means of 
visualiz ing decision rules  in rows and columns . A 
decision table in TableSpeak  always : 
• Addresses questions – once general ly and 
many times specifically.  
• Implic itly represents decision rules.  
• Provides answers (outcomes) selected from 
among potential outcome s. 
A key word in the definition of decision table is 
visualizing . Decision tables are a means of 
representing decision rules for viewing and 
updating in the best (most business -friendly) 
way possible.  
Decision tables are not a data management or 
database scheme – an entirely different issue. 
Some practitioners – and experts as well – are 
quite confused on this important point.4 
Not every table, of course, is a decision  table. 
Tables can be used productively for a great 
many purposes. If a table does not re present 
                                                           
4 In terms of three -schema architecture, decision 
tables are an external  schema. Refer to: 
http://en.wikipe dia.org/wiki/Three_schema_approach  
Part 1 : The Basics of Decision Tables  
© 2013 Business Rule Solutions, LLC. www.BRSolutions.com . All rights reserved.   9 / 121 decision rules  fully the table is not a decision 
table.   
Refer to Appendix 2 for examples of other kinds 
of tables potentially useful in analyzing or 
communicating decision logic, including look -up 
tables  and scenario tables . 
1.2 THE CASES THAT A  DECISION TABLE 
ADDRESSES   
What we want from a decision table  are the 
answers to a question. First, however, the 
decision table must be structured  properly to 
provide and manage these answers in optimal 
fashion.  
The most fundamental idea in structuring a 
decision table is that it addresses particular 
cases  of interest.  
A case  is simply some particular situation  – 
nothing more, nothing less. Cases might be 
called scenarios , but TableSpeak  prefers the 
term case  to avoid any sense of events or 
actions – i.e., ‘flow’. Think of a case as a 
snapshot of circumstances that at least 
momentarily don’t flow.  
The decision table in Figure P 1-1 specifically 
addresses the following four cases:  
• It is cold and rainy.  
• It is cold but not rainy.  
• It is not cold and not rainy.  
• It is not cold but rainy.  
These four cases are composite. Each is clearly 
based on two factors rather than just one:  
1. Is it cold?  
2. Is it rainy?  In TableSpeak  these factors are called 
considerations.   
A consideration  is a factor in making an  
operational bus iness decision ; something that 
can be resolved to two or more  cases .  
Important points:  
How should considerations be worded?  
Although considerations can always be 
worded as questions  (as above ) TableSpeak 
does not insist on that. For example, the  
two considerations above could be called 
temperature  and precipitation , respectively.   
The key is to word or name each 
consideration in a clear, business -friendly 
fashion.  
How many considerations should a decision 
table include ?  
The decision table in F igure P1 -1 involves 
two considerations.  
Many decision tables, of course, involve 
more than that. As more  considerations are 
added, the complexity of representation, 
analysis and management naturally 
escalates.  
It is generally recommended that t he 
number of considerations for a decision 
table not exceed  7.  
This threshold, discussed in Part 2, is called  
the complexity threshold . DecisionSpeak 
and TableSpeak  offer pragmatic techniques 
to ensure this important guideline can be 
followed.  
What kinds of cases can considerations 
produce?  
Part 1 : The Basics of Decision Tables  
© 2013 Business Rule Solutions, LLC. www.BRSolutions.com . All rights reserved.   10 / 121 Considerations produce two fundamental 
kinds of cases, elemental  and intersection , 
as discussed below.  
1.2.1 Elemental Cases  
An elemental cases  is a case  produced directly 
from a single consideration. Examples:  
1. The consideration Is it cold?  produces 
the two elemental cases:  
• Yes, it’s cold.  
• No, it’s not cold.  
2. The consideration Is it rainy?  also 
produces two elemental cases:  
• Yes, it’s rainy.  
• No, it’s not rainy.  
How should elemental cases be worded?  
Elemental c ases need not be specified in 
quite so wordy a fashion as above. For 
example,  simply yes and no would probably 
suffice . TableSpeak, however, always 
focuses on avoiding any possibility of 
ambiguity or misinterpretation.  Good 
judgment in this reg ard should be exercised.  
Note that cases are never worded as 
questions.  
How many elemental cases can a consideration 
produce?  
The two considerations above are binary – 
they each produce two elemental cases. 
Many considerations produce more than 
two cases . Examples:  
• category of customer  might produce 
three cases – platinum, gold  and silver . • province of Canada  produces ten cases.  
• zip code  or postal code  can produce 
many thousands of elemental cases.  
Each consideration should always produce 
at least two elem ental cases.  
A factor that results in only one elemental 
case (in scope) – e.g. California  – can be 
handled in some better way. In TableSpeak 
such a consideration might be treated as a 
scope item  or an exception . For discussion 
refer to Part 1.5.2 and Par t 3.2, respectively.  
What quality considerations apply to the 
elemental considerations?  
It is extremely important that the set of 
elemental cases for a consideration be:  
1. Exhaustive  (inclusive of all cases in 
scope ). 
2. Disjoint  (non -overlapping).  
Refer to Par t 5.2  for di scussion of these 
quality criteria and for illustrations of 
anomalies  that can occur in decision tables 
when the criteria are not satisfied . 
1.2.2 Intersection Cases  
An intersection case  is a compound case  
involving two or more elemental cases. 
Example:  
The intersection case  It is cold and rainy . is 
produced from the two considerations:  
• Is it cold?  
• Is it rainy?  
A decision table with only one consideration 
does not comprise any intersection cases. Since 
most decision tables involve two or more 
Part 1 : The Basics of Decision Tables  
© 2013 Business Rule Solutions, LLC. www.BRSolutions.com . All rights reserved.   11 / 121 considerations, however, most do involve 
intersection cases.  
How intersection cases are handled is a central 
issue in structuring decision tables. The next 
section explains.  
1.3 STRUCTURAL STYLE S FOR DECISION 
TABLES  
The basic structure of all decisi on tables  is 
based on rows and columns that intersect in a 
physical matrix. If there are m rows and n 
columns, the matrix can contain m × n cells.  
No cell means anything  until you indicate what 
it means. All cells are empty until you populate 
them. The ph ysical matrix is simply a blank 
canvas.  
TableSpeak makes two fundamental (and 
common -sense) assumptions about how this 
blank canvas can be used to represent decision 
rules . 
Assumption 1 . Each cell should always (a) 
represent just one kind of thing, and (b)  hold 
just one kind of thing. If not, there’s no way to 
guarantee uniform meaning in use of the 
physical matrix. All bets are off in trying to 
interpret and implement the result.  
Assumption 2.  All parts of each decision rule 
should be represented such that  they are easily  
understood as a unit . Decision rules are strings 
of meaning, like sentences. The strings can’t be 
represented randomly; the parts have to come 
together or the ‘sentence’ meaning is lost.  
The most basic question in formatting decision 
table s is therefore how many kinds of thing s can 
decision rules involve?  
The answer is three  kinds of things:  1. One or more consideration(s) and their 
elemental cases . 
2. Intersection cases  (assuming more than 
one consideration).  
3. Outcomes . 
How can a physical matrix  be used to represent 
these three kinds of things as easily understood 
units (decision rules)?  
Fortunately, the options in that regard are quite 
limited. In fact there are just three  basic styles in 
employing a physical matrix to create decision 
tables. T wo of the styles are simply variations on 
the same theme.  
Each style is introduced below, then discussed in 
greater detail in Part 2 .  
1.3.1  Intersection Style  
The simplest format for decision tables, the one 
friendliest for business peopl e, is the 
intersection style  (sometimes called crosstab  
style).   
Figure P1 -1 was organized using this style. As 
that example illustrated, considerations  are 
organized using each  of the two dimensions 
(rows and columns). All elemental cases  for 
each c onsideration are literally  ‘intersected’ 
using rows and columns.  
The cells of the leftmost column and of the 
topmost row represent elemental cases. Cells 
where these rows and columns meet represent 
intersection cases . To illustrate, all the cases 
represent ed by the What coat should be worn?  
decision table in Figure P 1-1 are labeled in 
Figure P 1-2. 
 
Part 1 : The Basics of Decision Tables  
© 2013 Business Rule Solutions, LLC. www.BRSolutions.com . All rights reserved.   12 / 121  
 
Although the physical cells where rows and 
columns meet in Figure P1 -2 represent  
intersection cases, those cells hold  outcomes 
(and can t herefore be called decision cells ). 
Figure P 1-3 illustrates.  
 
 
  
The intersection style is physically notable in 
two basic regards:  
1. No extra cells are required to hold 
outcomes. The cells representing 
intersection cases do double duty.  2. No elemental cases are ever repeated  
anywhere in the decision table.  
1.3.2 One -Rule -Per-Row  Style  
A second format for decision tables is the one-
rule-per-row style .  
In this style each row in its entirety (below the 
topmost) represents a decision rule . Figure P1 -4 
recasts the What coat should be worn?  decision 
table in Figure P1 -1 into this style.  
This format features:  
• One column per consideration , starting on 
the left. The consideration is labeled in the 
top row of the column, then elem ental 
cases  appear in the cells below it.  
• An additional column on the right provides 
decision cells ; that is, physical cells to hold 
the appropriate outcome  for each row 
(decision rule).  
The additional column could have just as easily 
appeared on the left  of the physical matrix. 
Since most Western languages are written from 
left to right, however, the right -hand side 
generally proves more natural for speakers of 
those languages.  
Placement on the right unfortunately does 
nothing to discourage practitioners  from using 
the style to express or interpret the content of  elemental

represents a procedural  rather than a 
declarative  approach. TableSpeak recommends 
never using a decision table for that purpose. 
Refer to  Part 2 .6 for additional discussion.  
Figure P1 -5 explicitly identifies the elemental 
cases and outcomes evident in Figure P1 -4.  
To simplify the representation of a one -rule-per-
row decision table, elemental cases in 
consecutive rows that are ali ke are often 
consolidated. Figure P1 -6 illustrates such 
consolidation for Figure P1 -4.  
Starting with that Figure, elemental cases are 
also simplified  from this point forward in the 
discussion  to just yes and no to avoid wordiness.  
Figure P1 -6. The What co at should be worn?

Is it 
cold?  Is it 
rainy?  What coat should be 
worn?  
yes yes lined raincoat  
no wool overcoat  
no yes unlined raincoat  
no none  
 
Now this revised version of the decision table 
avoids repetition of elemental cases in the 
leftmost column, rendering the decision table a bit more approachable. Note that repetition of 
elemental cases in the second column remains.  
In the one -rule-per-row style there is no literal 
intersection of rows and columns to produce 
intersection cases . Rather, elemental cases are 
effectively concatenated  (united in a series) to 
form intersection cases . Figure P1 -7 illustrates .

Compared to the intersection style, the one -

outcomes.  Figure P1 -5. Elemental Cases and Outcomes Identified for the What coat should be worn?

1.3.3 One -Rule -Per-Column  Style  
A third format for decision tables is the one-
rule-per-column style . In this style each column 
in its entirety (except the leftmost) represents a 
decision rule . Figure P1 -8 recasts the What coat 
should be worn?  decision table in Figures P1 -1 
and P1 -4 into this style.  
This format features:  
• One row per consideration , starting at the 
top. The consideration is labeled in the 
leftmost column of the row , then elemental 
cases  appear in the cells to the right of it. 
(Like elemental cases in the topmost row 
could have been consolidated.)  
• An additional row at the bottom provides 
decision cells ; that is, physical cells to hold 
the appropriate outcome  for eac h column 
(decision rule).  The additional row could have just as easily 
appeared at the top of the physical matrix. 
Figure P1 -9 illustrates.   
TableSpeak recommends (but does not insist 
upon) this top -row-for-outcomes arrangement 
for two reasons:  
• It most c losely aligns with the subject -
orientation of well -written business rules. 
For example, the first decision rule (in the 
second physical column) would be best 
written: A lined raincoat  should be worn if it 
is cold and rainy . 
• It physically emphasizes that de cision rules 
are declarative, rather than procedural. 
Putting the outcome at the bottom makes it 
tempting to express or interpret a decision 
rule as If … and if …  then do this. As before, 
TableSpeak recommends never using a 
decision table for that purpose.  
Refer to Appendix 3 for an additional example 
and a caution in using the top -row-for-
outcomes arrangement.  Figure P1 -8. The What coat should be worn?  Decision Table in the One -Rule -Per-Column Format

Part 1 : The Basics of Decision Tables  
© 2013 Business Rule Solutions, LLC. www.BRSolutions.com . All rights reserved.   15 / 121 Figure P 1-10 explicitly identifies the elemental 
cases and outcomes evident in Figure P 1-9. 
In this style there is no literal intersection of 
rows and columns to produce  intersection 
cases . Rather, elemental cases in effect are 
effectively concatenated  (united in a series) to 
form intersection cases, as illustrated by Figure 
P1-11. 
Compared to the intersection style, the one -
rule-per-column style:  
1. Employs an additional row to hol d 
outcomes (at top or bottom).  
2. Repeats elemental cases for each 
individual consideration to produce 
intersection cases.   
1.3.4 Row -or-Column -Style  
The one -rule-per-column style is very much like 
the one -rule-per-row style o n the two points 
above.  The difference between the two styles, more 
perception than substance, is simply that the 
former uses rows, rather than columns, to hold 
decision rules and outcomes. Therefore 
TableSpeak often refers to these two styles 
jointly as  the row-or-column -style .  
Both styles are less friendly to business people 
than the intersection style, and as discussed 
momentarily, are more prone to certain kinds of 
anomalies . Refer to Appendix 8 for additional 
background on the r ow-or-column -style.  
1.4 BASIC ADVANTAGES  OF INTERSECTION -
STYLE DECISION TABLE S 
Besides being very approachable for business 
people, intersection -style  decision tables  have 
additional advantages, ones so basic that at first 
they might not be obvious.  
Assume that the elemental cases  of each 
consideration  of an intersection -style  decision 
table  are listed exhaustively and non -Figure P1 -10. Elemental Cases and Outcomes Identified for the What coat should be worn?

appears one and only one time. (Software might 
be needed to ensure this, but it’s a relati vely 
simple matter.)  
Then it is physically  impossible for any 
intersection case : 
• Not to be represented at all (i.e., missing).  
• To be represented more than once.  
Why are these characteristics so important? The 
former helps ensure completeness . The latter  
provides a single point of change ( single -
sourcing ) for each decision rule . 
To illustrate these advantages, Figure P1 -12 
includes revisions of the What coat should be 
worn?  decision table in Figure P 1-1.  
Figure P1 -12. Empty Decision Cell and Changed 
Outc ome in an Intersection -Style Decision Table  
  
 
 
 
 
Completeness . The upper -right decision cell in 
this version of the decision  table is empty. The 
omission is highly visible.  
In the intersection -style format an empty 
decision cell signals clearly that an outcome  – 
more precisely a decision rule – is missing. In 
other words, such an omission  signals the 
decision logic  is not comp lete.  
 
 Important:  
An empty decision cell is always 
problematic in decision tables.   
No matter what style is used, a decision table 
should never leave any doubt about what 
outcome is appropriate for any given case in 
scope . 
Single -Sourcing . Suppose the ap propriate 
outcome for a rainy -but-not-cold day ( unlined 
raincoat ) were to change (say, to umbrella ). In 
the intersection -style decision table above, 
there is one and only one place, one quite 
obvious, to make that change.  
Important:  
Single -sourcing is al ways a  best practice in 
business rules .  
The reason is simple – things change constantly. 
So modifying any part of decision logic should 
always be intentional (and traceable), not 
accidental or haphazard.  
1.4.1 Row -or-Column -Style Decision Tables  
Achievin g these important goals in the row-or-
column -style  is not quite so straightforward – at 
least without specialized software support .  
Decision Rules . To illustrate potential problems, 
deliberate mistakes have been made in Figure 
P1-13. Keep in mind these mi stakes are 
relatively easy to spot because the decision 
table is so small.

Completeness.  The first deliberate mistake in 
Figure P1 -13 is the omission of the last row in 
Figure P1 -4 (indicating no coat should be worn if 
it is not cold and not rainy). Unlike the 
intersect ion style, there is no blank cell to warn 
you; the row just isn’t there . So it’s not so easy 
to see that the decision logic  is incomplete.  
Single -Sourcing . The second deliberate mistake 
in Figure P1 -13 is the repetition of the decision 
rule for a cold, rai ny day. The decision rule is not 
single -sourced, which leaves the door open to 
integrity (correctness) problems. Redundancy 
like this is not so easy to spot either.  
1.4.2  Challenges for the Row -or-Column Style  
Intersection Cases.  One challenge for the row -
or-column -style is that intersection cases , rather 
than elemental cases, need to be exhaustive 
and non -redundant. (In technical jargon 
ensuring strict , logical uniqueness of 
intersection cases is called single -hit.)  
Since the style does not exploit the ph ysical 
matrix in that regard, specialized software  is 
inevitably required to support it. Surprisingly, 
some software tools don’t provide it.  Elemental Cases.  In the row -or-column -style, 
elemental cases for all considerations cannot be 
listed non -redundantl y. In fact, the elemental 
cases for every consideration except one are 
listed redundantly in order to set up 
intersection cases. (Use of the special symbol 
does not matter  (dash) often reduces the total 
number of repetitions. Refer to Appendix 7.)  
In gene ral, a large number of  elemental cases 
will not be single -sourced. Refer to Figures P1 -6 
and P1 -9 for illustrations. Managing such 
redundancy can prove non -trivial. Refer to Part 
4.1.3 for discussion.   
1.4.3  Clarification Regarding Outcomes  
Two points conc erning outcomes on which all 
the styles discussed above do not differ:  
1. One or more potential outcomes  might 
be absent  from a decision table. A 
decision table is not required to use the 
complete set of potential outcomes . 
2. Outcomes need not be unique within  a 
decision table. Any potential outcome  
can appear multiple times – that is, as 
the outcome for more  than one 
decision rule.  
In other words, no decision table laid out in any 
of the styles above ever needs to be exhaustive 
or non -redundant with respect t o outcomes. 
The styles cannot  be differentiated on that 
basis.  
1.5 THE MEANING (SEM ANTICS) OF 
DECISION TABLES   
No decision table  is complete until its meaning 
(semantics) has been fully exposed. Otherwise, 
opportunities for misinterpretation abound.  
Part 1 : The Basics of Decision Tables  
© 2013 Business Rule Solutions, LLC. www.BRSolutions.com . All rights reserved.   18 / 121 The meaning of a decision table involves two 
core aspects:  
Aspect of Meaning 1.  The individual  meanings 
of terms and wordings – i.e., the business 
vocabulary – used for the decision table.  
A decision table should always be based on 
a structured business vo cabulary (concept 
model ). Refer to Part 4.1 for discussion and 
an example.  
Part 4.1 also highlights the critical 
importance of continuing alignment 
between question and outcomes, a central 
TableSpeak guideline.  
Aspect of Meaning 2.  The collective  purpose  and 
relevance (semantics) of the decision table.  
Three TableSpeak  approaches for explicitly 
communicating the collective semantics of a 
decision table are discussed below in this 
Part, along with advantages and possible 
disadvantages of each. The discussion 
focuses on  two items of special importance, 
name  and scope .  
Other important items (discussed in Part 3) 
include defaults , exceptions , and 
restrictions . 
Without adequate clarification of both aspects 
of meaning, a decision table cannot serve its  
purpose very well, whether for actually running 
the business or as a requirement for IT 
development.  
Remember, as is true for all business rules , you 
can never be sure who will eventually view a 
decision table, or for what purpose they might 
try to use i t. 1.5.1 The Name of a Decision Table  
Common industry practice is to name a decision 
table roughly after what it concerns. The 
decision table in Figure P1 -1, for example, 
concerns the choice of coats, so it might be 
called Coat Table . 
TableSpeak , however, recognizes the central 
importance to the business of the question that 
a decision table answers. That question is 
fundamental to what the decision table 
represents (i.e., its meaning).  
TableSpeak  strongly recommends using the 
question as the tab le’s name.  
Instead of Coat Table , for example, TableSpeak  
would recommend What coat should be worn? . 
1.5.2 The Scope of a Decision Table  
Addressing scope is essential for analyzing 
operational business decisions  and 
representing the decision logic  that su pports 
them.5  
Delineating scope for operational business 
decisions is often not a trivial matter. With 
respect to decision tables, misuse is almost 
guaranteed without adequate specification and 
communication of scope.  
For example, suppose the decision ta ble in 
Figure P1 -1 was created to represent decision 
logic applicable to just females , and just to San 
Francisco . Use of the decision logic for males or 
any other city would therefore be unwarranted 
and very likely incorrect.  
                                                           
5 The practitioner is urged to carefully review the 
important discussion about scope in Appendix 5 of 
the companion Primer on DecisionSpeak . 
http://www.brsolutions .com/IPSpeakPrimers  
Part 1 : The Basics of Decision Tables  
© 2013 Business Rule Solutions, LLC. www.BRSolutions.com . All rights reserved.   19 / 121 Such use would represent indu ctive reasoning , 
something generally inappropriate for business 
rules.  
Unless the scope of a decision table is universal 
within a business (not impossible but seldom 
the case) some explicit scope item(s)  should be 
expressed for the decision tab le.  
The scope items for the decision table in Figure 
P1-1, for example, could be expressed as 
follows. (An implicit ‘and’ is always assumed 
between scope items.)  
• gender: female  
• city: San Francisco  
Scope items also serve as a TableSpeak 
technique to achiev e the crucial objective of 
keeping decision tables as simple as possible.  
For example, treating gender  and city as 
considerations for the decision table in Figure 
P1-1 is pointless (at least at the present time). 
Doing so would simply add complexity – and 
that complexity would compound as the size of 
the decision table grows.  
A final observation: Scope items do not 
preclude modifying a decision table to broaden 
its coverage. When the scope is broadened the 
relevant scope items should simply be dropped 
or revised as appropriate.  
Now let’s examine the three TableSpeak  
approaches for explicitly communicating the 
collective semantics of a decision table  
1.5.3 Approach to Semantics 1: Wrapper  Rule 
Statement  
A concern in rule management is often that 
decision tab les participate fully in a larger body 
of guidance (business rules) that also includes a significant number of textual business rule 
statements.  
In this circumstance writing a wrapper rule 
statement for the decision table often proves 
the best approach. T hat way each decision table 
has a specific textual ‘handle’ in and among all 
the other rule statements.  
The wrapper rule statement for a decision table 
indicates what the decision table represents and 
how it should be interpreted – i.e., how to 
‘read’ the  decision table.  
For example, an appropriate wrapper rule 
statement for the decision table in Figure P1 -1 
might be expressed as follows.  Note that the 
two scope items have been carefully included as 
qualifications.  
Wrapper Rule Statement : The coat for a 
female person to wear in San Francisco 
must be as in the decision table ‘ What coat 
should be worn?’ . 
Suppose these scope items can be suitably 
documented elsewhere and still remain highly 
visible whenever the decision table is used (a bit 
doubtful). A short er ‘stub’ version might be:  
Revised Version : The coat to wear must be 
as in the decision table ‘ What coat should 
be worn?’ . 
1.5.4 Approach to Semantics 2:  Embedded 
Semantics  
A second approach aims at making the decision 
table itself as self -explanatory and  as self -
contained as possible. This approach involves 
embedding its collective semantics directly into 
it. No wrapper rule statement is necessary. 
Figure P1 -14 illustrates.  
Part 1 : The Basics of Decision Tables  
© 2013 Business Rule Solutions, LLC. www.BRSolutions.com . All rights reserved.   20 / 121 In this approach both of the following have 
been directly embedded within the dec ision 
table:  
• The question the decision table addresses 
(which also serves as the name of the 
decision table).  
• The two scope items.  
This approach serves quite well for this simple 
example. As additional semantics are added, 
however, such representation can  become 
increasingly cluttered . 
1.5.5 Approach to Semantics 3:  Decision Box  
A third approach aims toward providing a focal 
point for managing all the interrelated semantics of a more complex decision table.  
This approach involves creating a paired 
decisi on box for each decision table, which 
always appears whenever the decision table 
itself appears. Again, no wrapper rule statement 
is necessary. Figure P1 -15 illustrates.  
This decision table features a paired decision 
box providing the table’s collective se mantics:  
• The question the decision table addresses 
(which also serves as the name of the 
decision table).  
• The two scope items.  
The usefulness of a decision box becomes more 
and more apparent as the number and 
complexity of specifications related to the Figure P1 -14. Decision Table with E mbedded Semantics  
  Is it rainy?

be worn?

such specifications can include defaults , 
exceptions  and restrictions . 
Besides high visibility for these aggregate 
semantics, the decision box also provides a focal 
point for managing all such specifications as a 
unit (i.e., single -sourced ). These specifications can prove quite difficult to coordinate on an 
individual basis apart from the decision table.  
To highlight the  importance of the aggregate 
semantics, sometimes the best approach is to 
put the decision table inside  its decision box. 
Figure P 1-16 illustrates.

2.1 DECISION TABLES WITH ONE 
CONSIDERATION  
Most decision tables  are not as simple or so 
small as those examined so far. As subsequent 
sections discuss, for example, many decision 
tables have more than two considerations .  
Even a decision table with only one 
consideration might include complications. For 
example it might:  
• Address many  elemental cases  for a given 
consideration . 
• Specify some elemental cases as brackets  or 
ranges .  
Figure P2 -1 illustrates using a new operational 
business decision , What should be charged for 
shipping an order? .  
Figure P 2-1. Decision Table with One Consideration  
  
Observations  
• The decision table in Figure P2 -1 has just 
one consideration, zip code . The 
appropriate outcome , shipping cost , is given 
for each elemental case of zip code . Since 
there is only one consideration, the decision 
table does not address any intersection 
cases . 
• Many elemental cases are given (f or zip 
code ) in the decision table.  
A consideration with more than two or 
three elemental cases is called a many -case 
consideration .  
• Some elemental case s in the decision table 
are specified as brackets or ranges (e.g., 
04730 to 04739 ). 
A consideration with many elemental cases 
often produces a sizable table. For example, 
there are approximately 43,000 zip codes  in the 
United States.7 
To facilitate use, breaking the set of cases into 
sections, or even multiple tables, is often 
desirable.  
Is the decision table in Figure P2 -1 complete? 
Obviously many zip codes  seem to be missing.  
Aside:  For the purpose of this Primer, 
squiggly lines in any cell of a decision table 
simply indicate there are too many cases to 
show. A squiggly line has no inherent

used in actual practice.  
2.2 INTERSECTION -STYLE DECISION TABLE S 
WITH TWO CONSIDERATI ONS   
Most decision tables  involve more than one 
consideration . For example, an additional 
consideration for the operational business 
decision  What should be charged for shipping 
an order?  illustrated in Figure P2 -1 might be 
weight .  
In the intersection style , elemental cases  of this 
second consideration can be displayed along the 
other axis. Figure P 2-2 illustrates.  
Observations  
• The decision table in Figure P2-2 now 
includes a second consideration, weight. 
Five of its elemental cases (all ranges) are 
shown. Many more elemental cases for the 
consideration might be included in the 
decision table . • For a given zip code  (or range of zip codes ) 
the shipping cost  is now differential with 
respect to weight . An appropriate outcome  
(shipping cost ) is shown for each 
intersection case .  
• The number of decision cells  has now 
increased by at least a factor of five (and 
probably much more).  
2.3 MULTI -TABLE REPRESENTATION  OF 
DECISION LOGIC  
Some decision tables  involve more than two 
many -case considerations . For ex ample, an 
additional consideration for the operational 
business decision  What should be charged for 
shipping an order?  illustrated in Figure P2 -2 
might be month .  
In the intersection style , elemental cases  of this 
third consideration cannot be displayed in  a 
two-dimensional matrix. A third dimension is  
required.  
Figure P2 -2. Intersection -Style Decision Table with Two Con siderations  
 

Part 2 : Styles  of Decision Tables  
 
© 2013 Business Rule Solutions, LLC. www.BRSolutions.com . All rights reserved.   24 / 121 The easiest way to think of a three dimensional 
array is simply as multiple tables. Figure P2 -3 
illustrates.  
Observations  
• The multi -table  representation of the 
decision logic in Figure P2-3 is bas ed on the 
third consideration, month.  
• Three elemental cases of month  are shown 
(January, February,  and March ), each 
associated with a separate table. Tables for 
the nine remaining months  have not been 
shown.  
• For a given zip code  (or range of zip codes ) 
and a given weight  bracket, the shipping 
cost is now differential with respect to month . The number of decision cells  has 
increased by a factor of twelve.  
2.3.1 The Multi -Table Threshold for Decision 
Logic  
The example illustrated in Figure P2 -3 has 
crossed a n important threshold for the 
intersection style , which in TableSpeak  is called 
the multi -table threshold .  
At three  many -case considerations, multiple 
tables are apparently required to represent 
decision logic. (“Apparently” is simply a 
reminder that the easiest way to visualize a 
three -dimensional array is as multiple tables.)  
What is the simplest way to represent multi -
table  decision logic?  Figure P 2-3. Multi -Table Representation of Three Considerations  
 

Part 2 : Styles  of Decision Tables  
 
© 2013 Business Rule Solutions, LLC. www.BRSolutions.com . All rights reserved.   25 / 121 The best consideration to use as the basis 
for multi -table  representation is generally 
the consideration with the fewest number 
of elemental cases.  
That’s one reason month  was selected as 
the basis in Figure P2 -3 – it has only 12 
elemental cases, compared to 10,000s for 
zip code  and possibly 100s for weight . 
The elemental cases of the selected 
consideration should al so: 
• Be familiar to business people.  
• Provide a good starting point to obtain 
an outcome  for any given intersection  
case.  
The consideration month  rates highly on 
these criteria too.  
How many tables are required in a multi -table  
representation ?  
The number of  two-dimensional tables 
required to represent three considerations  
is equal to the number of elemental cases  
for the third consideration . Month  for 
example has 12. 
Can the decision logic for an operational 
business decision involve more than three many -
case considerations?  
Yes, but consider very  carefully th e number 
of decision cells such representation 
involve s.  
Suppose there are four many -case 
considerations that have m, n, p,  and q 
number of elemental cases respectively. 
The number of decision cells is  
multiplicative – specifically, m×n×p×q. 
That’s probably a very large number ! Beyond three many -case considerations, 
the practitioner is well -advised to 
reconsider the operational business 
decision by analyzing the following 
questions:  
• Can some portion(s)  of the outcomes be 
computed by some formula?  
• Can the operational business decision 
be decomposed into subdecisions? 
Refer to the DecisionSpeak Primer  for 
discussion.8 
• For the given decision, is it really all that 
important to manage the decision logic 
in words ?9 
• Considering the people -cost of 
managing a very large decision table , is 
the selectivity afforded by m×n×q×p 
outcomes really worthwhile to the 
business?  
The last point is especially important.  
Sometimes it is easy to forget that decision logic 
not only must be captured and represented, but 
also managed  over time (kept up -to-date and 
anomaly -free). There are no free lunches(!).  
Ask:  Is the complexity really  cost-effective 
for the business? Is managing the selectivity 
really worth the overhead it enta ils? 
The row-or-column -style , incidentally, offers no 
relief whatsoever  on this need -to-manage issue.

CONSIDERATIONS IN IN TERSECTION -STYLE 
DECISION TABLES  
A few-case consideration  is a consideration  
with only two or three elemental cases . For that 
reason a few -case consideration is sometimes 
called a simple consideration . Examples:  
1. The few -case consideration Is it cold?  in 
Figure P1 -1 produces the two elemental 
cases: 
• Yes, it’s cold.  
• No, it’s not cold.  
2. The few -case consideration  category of 
customer might produce three 
elemental cases : 
• platinum  
• gold  
• silver  
How are few -case considerations handled in 
creating decision tables ?  
Decision logic with a reasonable num ber of few -
case considerations can be handled in 
intersection style  decision tables. The 
intersection -style decision table in Figure P1 -1 
for example included two few -case 
considerations: Is it cold?  and Is it rainy ?. 
What is the highest number of few -case 
considerations considered reasonable ? The 
answer depends on several factors:  
• Does the decision logic  include  more than 
five few-case considerations (the row-or-
column threshold )?  If so, the row-or-column -style  is generally 
more suitable. Refer to Part 2 .5 for 
discussion.  
• How many many -case considerations  are 
present?  
The more many -case considerations are 
present (if any), the lower the number of 
few-case considerations that can be easily 
handled. The following discussion explain s. 
Let’s return to the operational business 
decision  What should be charged for shipping 
an order?  as first given in Figure P2 -1. At that 
point, the decision logic had only a single many -
case consideration, zip code .  
Now let’s add the few -case considerati on kind 
of packaging , which is known to have only two 
elemental cases  – box and tube . For a given zip 
code , selective outcomes for this new 
consideration are shown in Figure P 2-4. 
 
Figure P 2-4. Selective Outcomes for a Decision Table 
with One Many -Case Consideration and One Few -
Case Consideration  
 

Part 2 : Styles  of Decision Tables  
 
© 2013 Business Rule Solutions, LLC. www.BRSolutions.com . All rights reserved.   27 / 121 Observations  
• The decision table in Figure P2 -4 includes a 
second considerat ion, kind of packaging .  
• The two elemental cases of this few -case 
consideration, box and tube , appear at the 
top of the two right most columns.  
• Because the decision table uses both 
dimensions of the matrix (the vertical and 
the horizontal), the decision ta ble is 
intersection -style.  
• The columns for the two elemental cases 
produce differential outcomes  for shipping 
cost based on zip code . 
Caution   
Always be alert to the  completeness  of 
elemental cases – i.e., whether the set of 
eleme ntal cases is exhaustive .  Unlike Is it rainy?,  which can produce only 
yes and no, the new consideration in Figure 
P2-4, kind of packaging , is not intrinsically  
binary.  
Suppose the structured business vocabulary 
(concept model ) indicates reinforced envelo p to 
be an additional kind of packaging . If so the 
decision table in Figure P 2-4 is incomplete. 
Refer to Part 5.2 for additional discussion of 
quality concerns for elemental cases.  
To continue developing the example let’s 
reintroduce weight  as first given in Figure P2 -2. 
How would the few -case consideration kind of 
packaging  be handled alongside the two many -
case considerations zip code  and weight  in the 
intersection style?  
One way to handle the three considerations is 
multi -table , as illustrated in Figure P2-5. 
Figure P2 -5. Decision Table with Two Many -Case Consid erations and  
One Few -Case Consideration Using Multi -Table Representation  
 

Part 2 : Styles  of Decision Tables  
 
© 2013 Business Rule Solutions, LLC. www.BRSolutions.com . All rights reserved.   28 / 121 2.4.1 Embedded Cases  
Another way to handle the three considerations 
in the example above is by embedding  the few -
case consideration.  
In embedding , elemental cases for one 
consideration are repeated within every 
elemental case of another considerati on. Figure 
P2-6 revises the decision table in Figure P2 -5 
using embedding.  
Observations  
• The decision table in Figure P2 -6 embeds 
the few -case consideration, kind of 
packaging , within the many -case 
consideration weight .  
• The two elemental cases of this few -case 
consideration, box and tube , are repeated  
(embedded) within each elemental case of 
weight . 
• In contrast to Figure P2 -5, representation of 
the decision table is no longer multi -table .  • The decision table gives differential 
outcomes for  shipping cost  based on zip 
code , weight,  and kind of packaging . 
The consideration weight  was chosen for the 
embedding of kind of packaging  because it 
presumably has fewer elemental cases than zip 
code . That choice produces the least amount of 
overal l replication, an important goal.  
Cautions  
1. In the intersection style, TableSpeak 
advises embedding only few -case 
considerations.   
A consideration with four or more 
elemental cases (i.e., a many -case 
consideration) involves so much repetition 
that the resu lting decision table is unlikely 
to be business -friendly.  
2. Redundancy of elemental cases always 
produces potential integrity 
(correctness) concerns.   
For example, suppose the elemental case 
box needs to be revised to carton. Since this Figure P2 -6. Decision Table with Two Many -Case Considerations and  
One Few -Case Consideration Using Embedding  
 

Part 2 : Styles  of Decision Tables

the change must be made in multiple 
places. If not changed consistently and 
comprehensively, the integrity of the 
decision table is damaged.  
3. Use of embedding  in the intersection 
style degrades the natural (i.e., 
structural) resistance  of the style to this 
kind of anomaly . 
2.4.2 Selection of the Best Representation for 
Decision Logic  
As discussed above, your choice of format using 
the intersection style can be extended by multi -
table  representation and/or by embedding 
some few -case cons ideration(s).  
Refer to Part 5.1 for a comprehensive set of 
TableSpeak recommendations in this regard. 
Part 5.1 also:  
• Reviews the three major style -related 
thresholds in TableSpeak: multi -table 
threshold , row-or-column threshold , and 
complexity threshold . 
• Indicates when the row -or-column -style 
might work best. Part 2.5  examines that 
style more closely.  
2.5 ROW -OR-COLUMN -STYLE 
REPRESENTATION OF DE CISION TABLES  
An important threshold in representing decision 
logic  is reached when the number o f 
considerations  exceeds five.  
At this threshold the intersection style can no 
longer be used effectively (at least without appropriate automated support). The row-or-
column -style  needs to be used instead.   
This important threshold in TableSpeak  is called  
the row-or-column threshold .  
As Part 5.1 indicates, this threshold applies for 
any combination of few-case  and many -case  
considerations.  
Refer to Part 1 for a refresher on the row -or-
column -style and how it differs from the 
intersection style. Keep in m ind that the 
different styles are about visualizing  decision 
rules ; they are not about data management or 
database schemes.  
The row -or-column -style always unites 
(concatenates) elemental cases  in a series, 
which are represented in rows or columns.  
• If in r ows, the format is one-rule-per-row. 
• If in columns, the  format is  one-rule-per-
column .  
As explained in Part 1, these formats are only 
superficially different.  
The row -or-column -style is less friendly to 
business people and is more prone to 
anomalies . TableSpeak recommends its use only 
when absolutely necessary.  
The origin  of the row -or-column -style was 
primarily in software development and 
programming where binary considerations 
(branch points in flowcharts) abound.   
Refer to Appendix 8 for  additional background 
about the style.  
Part 2 : Styles  of Decision Tables  
 
© 2013 Business Rule Solutions, LLC. www.BRSolutions.com . All rights reserved.   30 / 121 Figure P2-7 illustrates the one-rule-per-row 
style  for a new operational business decision , 
What is the right delivery method for an order?  
(Refer to Appendix 3  for the same decision logic  
formatted in  the one -rule-per-column style .) 
This example has purposely been kept very 
simple to facilitate discussion and comparison . 
Assume many more cases (rows) are to be 
added later.   
The decision table in Figure P2-7 is organized as 
follows:  
• Seven few -case considerations are listed 
along the top row.  
• Three intersection cases  are shown in each 
of the three lower rows.  
• The appropriate outcome  for each of the 
three intersection cases, the particular 
delivery method for order , is shown at the 
right of each  row, in the rightmost column.  
• Each complete row holds  one decision rule . 
These rules could be verbalized individually 
as in Appendix 4 . 2.5.1 Does Not Matter  and Subsumed 
Elemental Cases   
Rather than showing a particular elemental 
case, some cells in Fig ure P2-7 show a dash. A 
dash in this context means does not matter .  
In other words , the outcome for that row is the 
same no matter what elemental case is 
indicated for the given consideration . Refe r to 
Appendix 7  for additional discussion of the 
special s ymbol does not matter  (dash).  
A decision rule that includes a does not matter  
(dash) for one or more of its considerations is 
literally  a general rule  since it covers more than 
one intersection case. A general rule is simply 
any decision rule that covers m ultiple (often 
many) cases.  
A does not matter  (dash) is a means by which 
the number of intersection cases in a decision 
table can be kept as low as possible. In the one -
rule-per-row style that means the fewest 
number of rows.  
A does not matter  (dash) can a rise in a decision 
table in either of two ways:  Figure P2 -7. A One -Rule -Per-Row Decision Table for the What is th e right delivery method for an order? Decision

Part 2 : Styles  of Decision Tables  
 
© 2013 Business Rule Solutions, LLC. www.BRSolutions.com . All rights reserved.   31 / 121 • Direct specification by the people creating 
or maintaining the decision table.  
• A subsumption  is discovered and the 
decision table is contracted  – i.e., some 
row(s) are eliminated  (in the one -rule-per-
row styl e).  
Refer to Part 5.9 for discussion of subsumption. 
Incidentally, automated tools can provide useful 
support in this area.  
Cautions  
1. The intended meaning of ‘does not 
matter ’ can be unclear.   
For example, which of the following does 
does not matter  (dash ) mean?  
(a.) ‘does not matter ’ and may be unknown , 
or 
(b.) ‘does not matter ’ but must be known .  
In TableSpeak a does not matter  (dash) 
always means the former. If something must 
be known, a consideration restriction  
should be specified.  
Refer to Part 5.8  for discussion.  
2. Manipulation of a decision table based 
on subsumption is not without certain 
dangers – original business intent can 
be lost.   
Refer to Part 5.11  for discussion .  
2.5.2 Using Row -Or-Column -Style Decision 
Tables  Effectively  
As previously dis cussed, the row -or-column -
style always unites (concatenates) elemental 
cases  in a series, which are represented in rows 
or columns.   The elemental cases for at most only one 
consideration can be non -redundant.  
The entire set of elemental cases for the se cond 
consideration must potentially be repeated 
within each  elemental case of the first 
consideration; the entire set of elemental cases 
for the third consideration within each  
elemental case of the second consideration; and 
so on.  
At the extreme every pos sible combination of 
elemental cases for all considerations is 
represented in rows or columns. (Not all such 
intersection cases  always appear, however, 
because of subsumption.)  
The row -or-column -style represents radical 
embedding .  
The follo wing important concerns arise from 
this fundamental characteristic of the row -or-
column -style.  
Uniqueness  of Intersection Cases . It is 
absolutely essential that all rows or columns in 
the row-or-column -style (i.e., all intersection 
cases) be strictly uniqu e (non -redundant) .  
If not unique , important anomalies  
(conflicts , multiple outcomes , and  
redundancies ) can occur. Refer to Part 5.5 
for discussion.  For row -or-column -style 
decision tables beyond very modest size, 
ensuring uniqueness requires software 
supp ort. 
In technical jargon ensuring strict , logical 
uniqueness of intersection cases is called 
single -hit. The  potential for anomalies if 
Part 2 : Styles  of Decision Tables  
 
© 2013 Business Rule Solutions, LLC. www.BRSolutions.com . All rights reserved.   32 / 121 ‘single -hit’ is not enforced has been 
recognized for decades.10   
Exhaustive Intersection Cases  It is also 
absolutely ess ential that the set of intersection 
cases in a row -or-column -style decision table be 
represented exhaustively.   
If not exhaustive , omissions  – missing 
decision rules – can occur. Refer to Part 5.6 
for discussion of this kind of anomaly .  
At issue is the completeness  of decision 
logic. Appendix 5 assesses the 
completeness of the decision table in 
Figure P2 -7. (It’s not complete at all!)  
Single -Sourcing of Elemental Cases . 
Redundancy of elemental cases always produces 
potential integrity (correctness) concern s.  
Whenever an  elemental  case is repeated 
(not single -sourced ), any modification  
must be made in multiple places.  If not 
changed consistently and comprehensively, 
the integrity of the decision table is 
diminished.  
In the row -or-column -style the redundanc y 
of elemental cases can be massive . 
Size. In general, where more than one many -
case consideration is present, the row -or-
column -style is practical only if every many -case 
consideration after the first one has a relatively 
small number of elemental cases.   
Not following this guideline can result in 
huge numbers of rows or columns. Refer to 
Appendix 6 for an illustration.  
                                                           
10 from at least the time of the Codasyl  report , A 
Modern Appraisal of Decision Tables, Report of the 
Decision Table Task Group , ACM, New York, 1982 . Software that supports contraction and 
expansion of decision tables based on 
subsumption  is generally essentially for 
such decision logic.  Refer to Part 5.9 for a 
simple illustration of contraction/  
expansion.  
For both the row -or-column -style and the 
intersection style, overall size  is dictated by 
the number of intersection cases.  
The number of decision cells  must 
necessarily be the same  for the same 
decision logic rendered in either style  – it’s 
the same decision logic just visualized in 
different formats.  
Business Friendliness . The row -or-column -style 
for decision tables tends to be less intuitive and 
harder to use than the intersection st yle.  
IT developers often like t he row-or-column -
style , but business people and business 
analysts often struggle with it .  
In larger decision tables, any particular 
intersection case of interest can be difficult 
to find, especially if the rows or columns 
are not kept well -ordered.  
Software Support . The row -or-column -style 
almost unavoidably requires automated support 
for decision tables of any size.   
Intersection -style decision tables are a bit 
better in that respect, but also require 
automat ed support as t he size and 
complexity of decision tables increase.  
At some point, the need for automated 
support has to be taken simply as a fact of 
life. 
Part 2 : Styles  of Decision Tables  
 
© 2013 Business Rule Solutions, LLC. www.BRSolutions.com . All rights reserved.   33 / 121 2.6 AVOIDING SEQUENCE IN DECISION  
TABLES   
Decision logic  and process models should be 
viewed as serving fundamenta lly different 
purposes.  
• Decision logic provides the best or optimal 
answers to business questions. Decision 
logic does not flow. It should not be viewed 
as actually doing  (transforming) anything.  
• Process models indicate how tasks should 
be performed in so me meaningful 
sequence. Process models always flow. They 
always actually do (transform) something.  
In short, decision logic should be declarative ; 
process models (by definition) should be 
procedural .  
Related TableSpeak  guidelines for designing 
decision ta bles are therefore:  
1. Never use a decision table simply to 
indicate what to do next.  
Decision tables should never include  any 
explicit actions  or refer to any processes or 
procedures. All considerations  should 
represent business factors; all outcomes  
should  be answers to some business  
question .  
Process models, logic trees, and flowcharts 
work perfectly well to represent the 
procedural aspects of business capabilities.  
2. Never design a decision table such that 
it matters in what order:  
• considerations are evalu ated.  
• rows are evaluated.  
• columns are evaluated.  Sequence should simply never matter in 
reading or interpreting  a decision table.  
Decision tables built following these TableSpeak 
guidelines are best for addressing the inherent 
complexity of operational bu siness decisions . 
Such decision tables also inevitably prove the 
most:  
• business -friendly  
• re-usable  
• platform -independent  
• easy  to change (agile)  
• manageable  
2.6.1 Best Practices  
The simple example presented in Part 4.2 
illustrates how a decision table can be used 
inappropriately to represent procedural logic. It 
also explains what to do about it.  
The row-or-column -style  of decision tables is 
particularly susceptible to misuse in this regard.  
• The left -to-right layout of the typical one-
rule-per-row decision tab le is quite easily 
misused to represent flow or sequence, 
often unknowingly. (The same is true for the 
typical top -to-bottom layout of one-rule-
per-column  decision tables.)   
• The row -or-column style presents no 
natural disincentives against empty cells for 
elemental cases , especially after the first 
consideration.  
As a result it is quite easy for a subsequent 
consideration to depend fully on just one 
elemental case of the previous 
consideration. Such representation is 
basically just flowcharting in tabula r form.  
Part 2 : Styles  of Decision Tables  
 
© 2013 Business Rule Solutions, LLC. www.BRSolutions.com . All rights reserved.   34 / 121 Part 4.3 discusses how to turn a sequential 
dependency within a decision table into a 
logical one. It’s actually quite easy. Although the 
conversion is illustrated using decision tables, 
the underlying principle is one that applies to all 
business rules .

© 2013 Business Ru le Solutions, LLC. www.BRSolutions.com . All rights reserved.   35 / 121 PART 3 : THE INTEGRITY OF DEC ISION TABLES  
3.1 OVERVIEW OF INTE GRITY CONCERNS   
Three basic reasons for diminished integrity 
(correctness) in decision logic  are: 
• Invalid  decision rules .  
This business problem can be resolved only 
by knowledge work ers and business 
analysts working under an appropriate 
methodology.  
• Structural deficiencies and lack of adequate 
support that permit  anomalie s to arise in  
decision tables .  
As discussed in Part 2 and related 
Appendices, p otenti al anomalies can be 
controlle d by care ful design and if available, 
appropriate software.  
• Lack of adequate controls over 
management and revision of decision tables 
such that their meaning (semantics) is 
compromised.  
Part 3 of the Primer focuses on this third 
problem, which centers on decision table 
management .  
Pragmatic protection of meaning (semantics) is 
a distinguishing characteristic of TableSpeak . 
Achieving consistency of operational business 
decisions  over time, and the lowest possible 
cost-of-management, requires focused 
techni ques for this area.  
Unfortunately, coordination of integrity has 
been widely neglected in the field. Software 
vendors are notorious in that regard.   
Remember, there are no silver bullets!  You 
simply can’t forget everything you know (or 
should know) about  business rules  when you do 
decision tables.  
Central to the area is thoughtful, deliberate 
treatment of exceptions , defaults and 
restrictions . Each is examined closely in 
subsequent sections in this part of the Primer.  
Exceptions, defaults and restriction s are part of 
the semantics (meaning) of a decision table. 
They should be managed within or alongside it.  
For this reason TableSpeak generally 
recommends  decision boxes  to accompany 
decision tables, especially for decision tables 
of greater complexity.   
Refer to Part 1 for a n introduction to 
decision boxes.  
All TableSpeak guidelines for integrity are based 
on the assumption that decision logic will 
change, often quite rapidly.  
The best design is therefore one that caters to 
such change, always doing  so in the manner 
friendliest to business people and business 
analysts.  
3.1.1 TableSpeak Guidelines for Elemental 
Cases and Outcomes  
The most basic area of integrity for decision 
tables pertains to composing elemental cases  
and outcomes . Refer to Parts P5 .2 and P5.3 and 
to P5.4, respectively, for important guidelines.  
 
Part 3 : The Integrity of Decision Tables  
© 2013 Business Rule Solutions, LLC. www.BRSolutions.com . All rights reserved.   36 / 121 One critically important TableSpeak convention:  
Every cell for an intersection case in a 
decision table must have something  in it.  
TableSpeak says it this way:  
Empty is not an option.  Empty hides 
meaning – semantics.  
3.1.2  Restrictions for Decision Tables  
A restriction  is a business rule  that directly 
governs the integrity (correctness) of a  decision 
table .  
Restrictions apply to the content of almost any 
decision tab le.  Identifying, specifying and 
managing restrictions are a critical part of 
decision table management. Failure in this 
regard can exact a high price.  
Table P3 -1 lists the three fundamental kinds of 
restriction that can be placed on decision tables. 
Each is discussed and illustrated in later sections 
of this part of the Primer.  
Observations  
• These three kinds of restriction correspond 
exactly  to the three kinds of decision 
dependencies in DecisionSpeak : relevance 
dependency , consideration dependency , and outcome dependency , respectively.11 
DecisionSpeak and TableSpeak fit hand -in-
glove with each other.  
• Between them, these three kinds of 
restriction cover everything in a decision 
table:  
1. The questio n (via relevance 
restrictions).  
2. The consideration(s) – and th rough 
them, elementa l cases and intersection 
cases.  
3. Outcomes.  
Literally, there is nothing e lse in decision 
tables to restrict.  
• A restriction often affects multiple cells in a 
decision table. Defining a restriction not 
only allows single -sourcing  of the re lated 
business intent, but also supports its faithful 
retention and consistent application as the 
decision table undergoes modifications  over 
time.

© 2013 Business Rule Solutions, LLC. www.BRSolutions.com . All rights reserved.   37 / 121 3.2 EXCEPTIONS    
The outcome  for any given case  is usually 
determined by a standard or typical set of 
consid erations . If not, then the case is an 
exceptional case .  
An exceptional case is a case in scope that does 
not use any of the considerations of a standard 
(normal) case. Each exceptional case 
presumably uses some other consideration(s).  
Suppose Halloween  is an exception  case for the 
What coat should be worn? decision table  
originally presented in Figure P1 -1. Halloween  is 
a special event  or holiday . Consequently the 
‘normal’ considerations Is it cold?  and Is it 
rainy?  cannot be used to determine an appropria te outcome for that case.  
Since the exceptional case is within scope an 
outcome still must be provided for it. Suppose 
the appropriate outcome is costume . Figure P3 -
1 illustrates specification for the exceptional 
case as embedded semantics.  
Note that an exception such as the one 
involving Halloween  is actually being handled by 
a decision rule  – just not one in the decision 
table proper. As always in business rules , an 
exception to a rule is simply another rule.  
Figure P3 -2 illustrates the same specificat ion 
using a decision box . 
As these decision tables illustrate , TableSpeak  
strongly recommends handling exceptional

As anot her example suppose that in 
determining eligibility  of app licants for auto 
insurance : 
• the standard considerations are: driving 
history, evidence of insurance, insurance risk 
score, credit rating, and state/province.  
• an applicant must be denied auto insurance 
if either a felon or under 18 years of age . 
Since criminal status  and age respectively are 
not among the standard or typical 
considerations for the decision logic, these 
cases are deemed exceptional cases . Their 
outcome can be specified as follows:  
Exception:  
ineligible if the applicant  
• has been convicted o f a felony involving 
a motor vehicle, or  
• is younger than 18 years of age.   
Identifying exceptional cases, and treating them 
apart from the decision logic  for ‘normal’ cases, 
can hugely simplify decision tables .  
It also helps keep the number of ‘normal’ 
considerations as low as possible.  3.3 DEFAULTS    
Omissions  (missing  rules) in a decision table  
can be addressed by a default .  
Suppose the company with the operational 
business decision , What should be charged for 
shipping an order? , in Figure P2-1: 
• ships o rders to all zip codes , but  
• has a standard price for shipping to many of 
them (say, $39).  
Cases  for all these same -price zip codes  need 
not necessarily be listed in the decision table. 
Instead, a default can be specified to cover 
them all. A default can b e expressed in different 
ways, including the two illustrated in Figure  
P3-3.  
Observations  
• The decision table on the left doesn’t 
explicitly say ‘default’, but the top row in 
effect gives one.  
• The decision table on the right – the 
preferred approach in TableSpeak  – says 
‘default’ explicitly.  
• In both decision tables above, the cases  
covered by the default are given by the 
logical expression “ not 00401 and not 
04401 and not 04402 … ”.  
That kind of expression is not one you’d 
want to see in a decision tabl e if you can 
possibly avoid it(!).

© 2013 Business Ru le Solutions, LLC. www.BRSolutions.com . All rights reserved.   39 / 121 Figure P3-3. Two Ways of Asserting a Default  
 
Calling a default out explicitly as such (as in the 
decision table on the right) is the simplest, most 
business -friendly way to express it. Separating 
the default from the other rows and columns  
makes it much more visible – that way it doesn’t 
get lost. (The default can also be included along 
with other semantics in a decision box .) 
Notes  
• Defaults are another important means by 
which decision tables can be simplified and 
kept as small as possible.  
• A default in a decision table is simply 
another decision rule , one that supplies the 
appropriate outcome(s) for missing cases. A 
default can be used to ensure a decision 
table is complete . • In software engineering a default might be  
viewed as otherwise , or as the else in if-
then -else. 
• A default and an exception are not the 
same thing. A default uses the ‘normal’ 
considerations for a decision table; an 
exceptional case never  does. That way there 
is never any conflict about which one 
applies to any particular case.  
• Defaults are by no means always as simple 
as a single quantity or instance. For 
example, a set of defaults might apply 
requiring a completely separate decision 
table. 
Some approaches recommend avoiding default s 
on the grounds they disturb the ‘natural order’ 
of well -structured decision tables. In real -life

so specifying defaults should be permitted.   
Nonetheless : 
Defaults should always be used very 
carefully.   
Defaults:  
• Might leave important cases unexamined 
that should have distinct outcomes .  
• Can easily be forgotten (but still apply) as 
decision logic evolves over time. Once 
(re)deployed, such un(re -)examined 
decision logic can produce unpleasant 
surprises.  
3.4 RELEVANCE RESTRI CTIONS  
A relevance restriction  always answers the 
following general pattern question : 
Can an outcome  from one significant 
operational business decision  make any 
outcome from a second operational 
business decision meaningless ? 
As applied to a decision table  a relevance 
restriction always either:  
• Precludes  any outcome(s)  for some case(s)  
from the second decision.  
 
In this role the relevance restriction 
produces a preemption .   
• Warns  that if any outcome  is provided for 
certain case (s) from the second decision, 
the outcome is not  necessarily valid.  
 
In this role the relevance restriction 
produces a  caveat . 
These roles are individually discussed and 
illustrated below.  3.4.1 Relevance Restrictions as P reempti ons 
DecisionSpeak recogniz es relevance 
dependencies  between operational business 
decisions .12 A relevance dependency occurs 
when the answer to one question can 
completely eliminate the need or possibility for 
an answer to another question. In such cases 
the other  oper ational busines s decision is  
preempted  – made meaningless.  
For example, suppose  the business with the 
operational business decision What should be 
charged for shipping an order?  in Figure P 2-4 
decides not to ship:  
• any orders  to certain zip codes . Possibly 
those cases ar e unprofitable, too slow, too 
dangerous, or too difficult to manage.  
• tubes to certain zip codes . Possibly the 
postal facilities in those cases do not have 
the right kind of equipment.  
For these particular cases:  
• Asking the question What should be 
charged f or shipping an order? is pointless 
because the answer to the more basic 
business question Can an order be shipped 
to a customer ? is no. 
• There is no shipping charge  whatsoever (at 
least not one that’s usable). Any shipping 
charge  has been made meaningless – 
preempt ed.  
Figure P3-4 shows the appropriate 
specifications for these restrictions.  
The decision cell(s)  for all preempted cases in 
the decision table  have been:

Code and Kind of Packaging  
 
• grayed -out. Gray -out is a TableSpeak 
convention indicating no revision (updating) 
is permitted (at least until the restriction is 
lifted, if ever).  
• specified as n/a (not applicable ). Such a 
case is preempted ; that is, no outcome for it 
is meaningful. Refer to Append ix 7 for 
additional discussion of n/a. 
The advantage of retaining grayed -out decision 
cells with n/a in the decision table is to 
emphasize that the cases have not been 
overlooked. Omitting the cases from the 
decision table could be mistaken for omissions  
(missing rules), which they are not. 
 
 Observations  
• The first preemption affects multiple cells 
(two). Defining the restriction only once 
allows single -sourcing  of business inten t. 
• Not applicable (n/a)  should  be viewed as a 
definite outcome.  
The decision logic is basically saying this: 
“The case is recognized as being a case in 
scope , but the correct answer to the 
question being asked is that there is no 
answer to the question  in this case.”  
• Preempted cases are not scope items  – 
decision logic never gives definite outcomes 
for scope items per se.  
• Preempted cases are not exceptions  of any 
kind – preempted cases do not use 
considerations  that are any different from 
‘normal’ case s.  
• Preemptions can be much more complex 
than those illustrated above. For example 
they might require specifying separate lists 
or tables. Refer to Part 5.7 for examples.  
• Although the first restriction above affects 
multiple cells (two), its specification has 
been single -sourced .  
If some change(s) to the preemptions 
and/or to any of the affected outcome(s) 
are subsequently desired, the restrictions 
provide a single point to coordinate (permit) 
change to the outcome(s).  
As an additional example, suppose  the business 
with the operational business decision What 
should be charged for shipping an order?  in 
Figure P2 -2 decides not to ship orders that 
weigh 100 kgs or more.  For these cases:  

Part 3 : The Integrity of Decision Tables  
© 2013 Business Rule Solutions, LLC. www.BRSolutions.com . All rights reserved.   42 / 121 • Asking the question What should be 
charged for shipping an order? is poi ntless 
because the answer to the more basic 
business question Can an order be shipped 
to a customer ? is no. 
• There is no shipping charge  whatsoever (at 
least not one you can use). Any shipping 
charge  has intentionally been made 
meaningless – preempt ed.  
Figure P3-5 shows the appropriate 
specifications for this restriction.  
The decision cell(s)  for preempted cases in this 
decision table (weight ≥ 100kgs) have not been 
shown. They don’t have to be – that’s an option.  
If someone tried to update the decision table to 
show such a case, however, the restriction 
would have to be removed first. The or iginal 
business intent has been retained and is being continuously enforced by the restriction.  
3.4.2 Relevance Restrictions as Caveats  
A relevance restriction that acts as a caveat is 
really a just a weaker version of a p reempt ion. 
The decision logic basi cally says: “Here’s an 
outcome, but don’t count on it being valid 
because the business ques tion hasn’t been 
asked properly .” 
Consider the following example of relevance 
dependency between operational business 
decision s discussed in the DecisionSpeak  
Primer .13  
In determining eligibility of applicants f or auto 
insurance, if an applicant is not eligible for 
coverage, there is no need to determine what to 
charge the applicant as a premium. This 
relevance dependency is illu strated in Figure  
P3-6 using a Q -Chart .

Must processes always address the questions 
involved in a relevance dependency in bottom -
to-top sequence? No.  
For the  questions in Figure P3 -6, for example, a 
customer -friendly, web -based application might 
permit price -conscious consumers to ask about 
the premium before  asking about eligibility.  
Some precautions, however,  should clearly be 
taken. Any outcome produced in  a price -before -
eligibility sequence is not necessarily valid.  
The solution is to specify a restriction that 
requires a caveat  to be issued along with the 
premium.  The caveat, in the form of a message, 
is specified as part of the restriction. The 
message  for the example above might be 
worded:  
Securing coverage at the given price subject 
to eligibility.  The restriction ensures a  disclaimer is given by 
any process or use case that supports a price -
before -eligibility sequence.   
3.5 CONSIDERATION RE STRICTIONS  
A consideration restriction  always answers the 
following general pattern question : 
Are there ways  in which considerations  
should not be combined?  
A consideration restriction  always constrains 
combination of elemental cases  into 
intersection cases  within a decision table . The 
net effect is to prohibit certain intersection 
cases that would otherwise be possible. 
Examples are provided in Figures P3 -7 (only 
partially populated) and P3-8. 
 
 
 
 Is an applicant eligible 
for auto insurance?  
What premium should an 
applicant be charged?  
Part 3 : The Integrity of Decision Tables  
© 2013 Business Rule Solutions, LLC. www.BRSolutions.com . All rights reserved.   44 / 121 A part naturally cannot be substituted for itself. 
Such combinations  (intersection cells) are 
meaningless given the question the decision 
table addresse s.  
In Figure P 3-7 a consideration restriction has 
been specified (at top) to preclude such 
possibility.  
Observations  
• Although the restriction affects multiple 
cells, its  specification has been single -
sourced . 
• Gray -out of the intersection cells indicates 
no revision (updating) is permitted (at least 
until the restriction is lifted, if ever).  
For the example illustrated by Figure P3 -8 let’s 
assume that traveling  on business  (for the 
location?  consideration) precludes desire to cook ? (the consideration in the second column). 
The consideration restriction, n/a if traveling  on 
business,  has consequently been specified for 
the desire to cook?  consideration . 
The intersection case s given by the bottom 
three rows are thereby constrained – 
combinations including yes and no for the desire 
to cook?  consideration are not permitted.  
• Yes obviously needs to be disallowed 
because when traveling on business the re is 
usually nowhere to cook.   
• No is also disallowed because not desiring  
to cook is different than not being able  to 
cook – it’s not the same meaning.  
Gray -out of intersection cells in Figure P3 -8 
indicates no revision (updating) is permitted for 
them (at least until the restriction is lifted, if 
ever).   Figure P 3-7. Example of a Consideration Restriction Prohibiting Combinations of Self with Self  recommended

Unknowns  
A consideration restriction  can be used to 
answer the special pattern question : 
Can a decision  still be made where does not 
matter (dash) applies and no elemental 
case  is presented ? 
Refer to Part 5.8 for discussion.  
3.6 OUTCOME RESTRICT IONS  
An outcome restriction  always answers the 
following general pattern question : 
Are certain cases  limited to a particular 
outcome or to some subset of all potential 
outcomes ?  
An outcome  restrictio n applied to a decision 
table  directly constrains outcomes. The net effect of an outcome restriction is always either 
to: 
• Establish a ‘ fixed ’ (or ‘set’)  outcome  for 
some case(s) . 
• Narrow the set of potential outcomes for 
some case(s).  
Use of outcome restri ctions for each of these 
roles is discussed and illustrated individually 
below.  
3.6.1 Fixing the Outcome for Some Case(s)  
To illustrate a fixed outcome l et’s return to the 
operational business decision What should be 
charged for shipping an order?  examined  earlier.  
Suppose the business wants to set a fixed price, 
$250 , to ship orders to  zip code  99950  that 
weigh less than 5 kgs. Figure P3 -9 illustrates 
how the fixed price can be specified as an 
outcome restriction.  Figure P3 -8. Example of Elemental Case for One Consideration

Part 3 : The Integrity of Decision Tables  
© 2013 Business Rule Solutions, LLC. www.BRSolutions.com . All rights reserved.   46 / 121 Observations  
• In Figure P3 -9 the outcome restriction $250 
for zip code 99950 & weight < 5 kg has been 
specified . All corresponding intersection 
cases in the decision table show the 
outcome $250 .  
• The outcome restriction affects multiple 
cells (five). Defining the restriction only 
once allows single-sourcing  of business 
intent.  • Since the outcome restriction prohibits any 
of these outcomes from being changed, 
these intersection cells are grayed -out. 
Otherwise, direct assertions of prices  
differing from $250  could easily occur.  
3.6.2 Narrow the Set of Possible Outcomes for 
Some Case(s)  
Rather than fixing outcomes, an outcome 
restriction can also be used to narrow the set of 
permissible outcomes for some or all cases.

shipping charge < $2,000  is specified . All 
intersection cases in the decision table  
consequently must fall into this range. No 
modification (updating) of the table is allowed 
that would violate this restriction.  
In Figure P3 -11 the outcome r estriction same 
form of exercise on Monday, Wednesday, and 
Friday depending on precipitation is specified . No modification (updating) of the decision table 
is allowed that would violate this restriction.  
In Figure P3 -12 the outcome restriction cals on

modification (updating) of the decision table is 
allowed that would violate this restriction.

BUSINESS  
4.1 DEC ISION TABLES AND STR UCTURED 
BUSINESS VOCABULARY (CONCEPT 
MODELS ) 
No form of business rule  expression or 
representation, including decision tables , is 
viable or complete if not based on a well -
defined, well -structured business vocabulary. 
Knowing the busine ss meaning of the words 
that appear in expressions or representations is 
a key element for success.  
That you must know exactly what the words 
mean is so obvious it almost goes without 
saying. Especially in running a complex business 
(and what business isn’t complex these days?!) 
the meaning of the words should never be 
taken as a ‘given’.  
Unfortunately, many approaches pay nothing 
more than lip service to this need. As a result, 
practitioners often end up having to learn the 
hard way.  
Rapid progress  in developing decision tables 
without ongoing coordination of vocabulary 
is usually just an illusion.  The really hard 
part is in the words.  
A well -developed discipline exists for creating 
structured business vocabularies (concept 
models ) backed by a powerful s tandard.14 Our

Rules  (SBVR), released by Object Management Group 
(OMG) in late 2007. For an introduction and 
explanation, refer the SBVR Insider section on 
www.BRCommunity.com .  approach, based on that standard, is called 
ConceptSpeak15.  
A single, unified concept model is a prerequisite 
for creating any scalable, multi -use body of 
guidance, no matter how the business rules are 
represented or expressed.  
Incidentally,  true  completeness  of decision logic  
can be determined only by reviewing the 
underlying business vocabulary.  
4.1.1 Illustration of Concept Model  
How to build a complete concept model is 
beyond the scope of this discussion. Looking at 
the issue on a smaller  scale, however, is quite 
instructive.  
Figure P4 -1 presents a draft graphical concept 
model supporting the What coat should be 
worn ? decision table  illustrated in Figure P1 -1. 
The example follows ConceptSpeak 
conventions.  
Observations  
• Three general concepts are represented by 
the terms  article of clothing, coat,  and 
weather condition.  
• Coat  is a category of article of clothing . 
 
                                                           
15 ConceptSpeak  is the BRS methodology for 
structured business vocabularies  (concept models ). 
Refer to  Business Rule Concepts  4th ed (2013), 
Chapter 1 and Part 2. Available on

© 2013 Business Rule Solutions, LLC. www.BRSolutions.com . All rights reserved.   51 / 121 Figure P4 -1. Draft Graphical Concept Model for the 
What coat should be worn ? Decision Table  
 
• Three examples are indic ated for coat: lined 
raincoat, unlined raincoat, and wool 
overcoat . 
• Two examples are indicated for weather 
condition: cold, rainy.  
Behind the graphical concept model are, of 
course, the all -important definitions (not 
shown).  
Note that the co ncept model does not indicate 
any connection (verb concept) between coat  
and weather condition to represent the decision 
rules  in the decision table. Doing so would 
create redundancy.  
TableSpeak Best Practice  
Decision rules per se should never be shown 
in concept models, just the basic vocabulary 
(noun and verb concepts) needed to express 
them.   
In general, a graphical concept model should 
represent only concepts that cannot be computed or derived by any business rule or 
found in some decision table. In ot her words, a 
graphical concept model should show only 
vocabulary that is structurally basic to the 
problem space.  
4.1.2 Typical Change Scenario  
Suppose the subject matter experts decide that 
what should be worn on a day that is hot is not 
the same as on a day that is moderate . In other 
words, just saying not cold  is insufficient for the 
selectivity in outcome required.  
Figure P4 -2 presents revised decision logic  (new 
elemental cases  highlighted in purple).

Observations  
• The consideration  Is it cold? has been 
renamed temperature level.  This 
consideratio n now shows three elemental 
cases : cold, moderate, and warm .

rather than four ( 2×2). A total of six decision 
rules are now represented.

Worse is the following problem: Neither 
umbrella  nor sweater  is a coat ! Even the 
wording of the question the operational 
business decision  addresses is now awry. That 
problem must be fixed straightaway.  
TableSpeak Best Practice  
The question and the outcomes  (answers) 
for each operational business decis ion 
should remain aligned at all times.   
Given the new decision rules the question 
addressed by the operational business decision 
might now more accurately  be worded What 
weather gear  is appropriate ? A revised concept 
model is shown in Figure P 4-3. Observations  
• The general concept article of clothing  has 
been renamed weather gear . 
• Examples of weather gear are: umbrella  and 
sweater . 
• Temperature  level  has been added as a 
category of weather condition . 
• Examples of temperature  level  are: cold, 
moderate, and warm . 
• Rainy  is now shown as an example of 
precipitation , a new category of weather 
condition. (The addition of  precipitation  is 
presumably in anticipation of other 
examples besides rainy .) 
4.1.3 Single -Sourcing Definitions and Names  
Most styles of decis ion tables permit or require 
one or both of the following:  
• The same elemental case to appear multiple 
times (often a great many times in the row-
or-column -style ).

(in different decision rules).  
Often the same elem ental case or potential 
outcome  also appears in multiple  decision 
tables. With such extensive use, coordination is 
a significant concern – unfortunately one 
seldom highlighted by software vendors and 
many consultants.  
Effective coordination of this busin ess 
vocabulary requires at least two things, both 
provided by a concept model:  
1. Single -sourcing  of meaning (definitions).   
2. Single point of change and traceability when 
any elemental case or potential outcome is 
re-named.  
On a very  small scale such changes  are 
illustrated by Figure P4 -4.  Suppose the elemental case pajamas  in the 
third column needs to be renamed sleeping 
attire . As illustrated in in Figure 4-4 (given 
earlier as Figure P 3-8), changes need to be 
made in at least two places.  
Important:  
Never underestimate  how frequently  sets of 
elemental cases and potential outcomes 
might be revised .

actions  The outcomes  shown in the rightmost 
column (highlighted in light blue) are 
actions. Their labels are clearly based on 
verbs in imperative (command) form.  Outcomes should never be something to 
do, but rather simply answers to some 
business question.

behavior  The outcomes are not only actions, they 
are system actions ( create, update ). Outcomes should never be something 
system -ish to do (e.g., create a new 
customer record). Never focus on capturing 
system logic for software development or 
control.  
sequence  The order in which the considerations  are 
evaluated matters. It makes no sense to 
ask whether the line of business where the 
customer did business is authorized to 
update before  asking whether the 
customer is a new or an existing one.  A sequential de pendency should never be 
embedded in a decision table.  
empty or 
missing 
cell The second row is missing a cell where an 
elemental case  should go. Such omission is 
inevitable when a decision table embeds a 
sequential dependency  between 
considerations.  Empty  or missing cells (ones that should 
hold an elemental case) should be carefully 
avoided. They always  signal some problem.  
 
Part 4 : Designing Effective Decision Tables  for Business  
 
© 2013 Business Rule Solutions, LLC. www.BRSolutions.com . All rights reserved.   55 / 121 A proce dural representation (e.g., a process 
model, use case, flowchart, etc.) is more natural 
and effective in capturing and representing logic 
where:  
• The desired determination involves what 
action to take.  
• The order (sequence) in which the factors  
are evalua ted matters.  
Logic tree s can be effective for capturing and 
representing such logic . Figure P 4-6 presents a 
logic tree to supplant the decision table above.  
Observations  
• The label for each box starts with a verb in 
the imperative (command) form (i.e., ask, 
create, update, take ). Representations of 
procedural logic should always adhere to 
this naming convention for actions or tasks.  
• The two ask boxes involve explicit 
questions. Asking questions in procedural 
representation of logic is fine with the 
followin g caveats:  
1. Such questions should always pertain to determining what to do next.  
2. If the order of asking the questions can 
be shown not to matter, a decision table 
should be used instead.  
4.3 CONVERTING PROCEDURA L 
DEPENDENCIES INTO DE CLARATIVE 
DEPENDENCIES  
Problem Statement: The company needs to 
price its products appropriately. Some products 
are pre -owned (acquired from an external 
source), which makes a difference in its price. 
Prices should be determined as follows. If a 
product is:  
• Pre-owned but not subs equently work ed on 
in-house, its price should be the purchase 
price plus 12%.  
• Pre-owned but significant work has been 
done on it, its price should be hours  worked  
plus 15%.   
• Standard, its list price  should be charged . 
• Custom, the contract price  should be 
charged.

statement is  What should be charge d for a 
product?  Figure P4 -7 presents a potential

decision logic .

Observations  
• The decision table shows two 
conside rations , kind of product  and worked 
on?.  
• Price is shown as the outcome  (in the 
rightmost column).  
• The second consideration, worked on?,  
applies only if the kind of product is pre-
owned . As a consequence:  
1. Sequence is required in in terpreting the 
decision table.  
2. Empty cells appear for the worked on?  
consideration.  
The empty cells imply a second, more selective 
question that can be worded What price should 
be charged for a pre-owned  product?  This 
question should be addressed separately.  Figure P4 -8 illustr ates, eliminating the 
sequential dependency  embedded in the 
original decision table.  
Observations  
• A decision table for a second, more 
selective operational business decision , 
What should be charged for a pre-owned  
product? , has been added at right. It has 
one consideration, worked on? . 
• The outcome for this second decision table 
is pre-owned product price  (in green16). This 
outcome also appears for elemental case 
pre-owned  in the original, revised decision 
table (at left).  
• The empty cells and sequential depen dency 
have been eliminated from the original 
decision table. A logical dependency  now 
exists between the two decision tables. This 
logical dependency is based on the common 
term, pre-owned product price .  
In business rules , a logical dependency exists 
when ever one expression or representation 
uses some concept computed or derived by 
another.  
Use of logical dependencies is a highly effective 
means to single -source  different bits of 
business logic and to ensure reusability.

5.2 QUALITY ISSUE S FOR ELEMENTAL CASE S 
Two important quality goals for decision tables  
are: 
• Completeness . A decision table should give 
an outcome  for every case in scope . 
• Certainty of outcome. A decision table  
should never leave any doubt about what 
outcome  is appropriate for any case in 
scope . 
Improper or inadequate specification of 
elemental cases  for a consideration  can directly 
compromise both goals, as individually 
discussed and illustrated below.  
5.2.1 Completeness  
Figure P5 -1 presents a revised version of Figure 
P1-1.  
• In th e original version  the elemental cases  
for the consideration  Is it cold?  were : Yes, 
it’s cold  and No, it’s not cold .  • In th e revised version, the elemental cases 
have been changed to the temperature 
ranges colder than  11°C and 11°C  ≤ 
temperature ≤ 27°C  (highlighted in purple).  
Let’s assume that the scope of the decision 
table was to cover all possible temperatures.  
The revision fails to address the case  warmer 
than  27°C . The decision table is compromised in 
that regard; it is incomplete .

Part 5: Designing High -Quality Decision Tables  
 
© 2013 Business Rule Solutions, LLC. www.BRSolutions.com . All rights reserved.   61 / 121 TableSpeak Best Practice   
The elemental cases for any given 
consideration in a decis ion table should 
always be  exhaustive .  
The same problem can arise in row -or-column -
style decision tables. Figure P5 -2, which gives 
the same decision logic  as Figure P 5-1, 
illustrates.  
Figure P5 -2. Compromised Completeness Due to 
Missing Elemental Cases i n Scope in a Row -or-
Column -Style Decision Table  
Is it cold?  Is it rainy?  What coat should 
be worn?  
colder than 
11°C  yes lined raincoat  
no wool overcoat  
11°C  ≤ 
temperature 
≤ 27°C  yes unlined raincoat  
no none  
 
Again, what about warmer than 27°C ? The 
elemental cases given for the Is it cold?  
consideration are not exhaustive . The decision 
table is compromised in that regard; it is 
incompl ete.  
5.2.2 Certainty of Outcome  
Figure P5 -3 presents another revised version of 
Figure P1 -1. In this revised version, the 
elemental cases for the consideration Is it cold?  
have been changed to the temperature ranges 
colder than  11°C and warmer than 9°C  
(highlighted in purple).  Figure P 5-3. Compromised Certainty of Outcome Due 
to Overlapping Elemental Cases  
 
Although the tempera ture ranges given in 
Figure P 5-3 are now exhaustive, they overlap at 
10°C. What are the appropriate outcomes for 
the intersection cases?  
The decision table is compromised because the 
outcomes are uncertain.  
• For yes ( it’s rainy ) is the correct outcome 
lined raincoat  or unlined raincoat ? Either? 
Both?  
• For no (it’s not rainy ) is the correct outcome 
wool overcoat  or none ?  
Note: These two outcomes are mutually -
exclusive so the answer can’t be ‘both’.  
TableSpeak Best Practice  
The elemental cases for any give n 
consideration in a decision table should 
always be disjoint  (not overlapping).  
The same problem can arise in row -or-column -
style decision tables. Figure P5 -4, which gives 
the same decision logic  as Figure P 5-3, 
illustrates.    Is it rainy?  
  yes no Is it cold?  colder  
 than  11°C  lined 
raincoat  wool 
overcoat 
warmer 
than 9 °C   unlined 
raincoat  none

be worn?  
colder  
than 11°C  yes lined raincoat  
no wool overcoat  
warmer  
than 9°C yes unlined raincoat  
no none  
 
Again, note that the temperature ranges given 
in Figure P5 -4 overlap at 10°C. What are the 
appropriate outcomes for the intersection 
cases?  
5.2.3 Brackets and Ranges as Elemental Cases  
Elemental cases  for a consideration  can be 
specified as brackets or ranges . Examples:  
• ranges of temperatures , as illustrated in the 
Figures above.  
• ranges of zip codes , as illustrated in Figure 
P2-1.  
How narrowly should brackets or ranges be 
specified?   
TableSpeak Best Practice  
If differential  outcomes  are likely to  be 
needed for different cases within a bracket 
or range  of a consideration, then the cases  
should be broken down .  
On the other hand, if the chances of needing 
differential outcomes in the future is small, then 
keeping a decision table  as compact and as simple as poss ible easily trumps higher 
granularity.  
5.3 EXPLICIT AND CLASS -BASED ORS IN 
ELEMENTAL  CASES  
Figure P5 -5 includes  elemental cases  involving 
ORs for the consideration  day of week . The OR 
is explicit in one elemental case and class -based 
in another.  
Figure P5 -5. An Example of Elemental Cases with ORs  
 
Observations  
• An OR is explicit in the case Sunday or 
Saturday . 
• An OR is implicit in the case weekday. 
Weekday  as used here is a general concept 
(class) that actually stands for: Monday  OR 
Tuesday  OR Wednesday  OR Thursday  OR 
Friday .  
A potential problem with this representation is 
that the appropriate outcome  for an y given day 
of week  could change, independently and 
selectively. The decision table  is not laid out to 
handle that possibility very well.   
TableSpeak Best Practice  
If differential  outcomes  are likely to  be 
needed for ORed cases of a consideration, 
then the  cases  should be broken down .  day of  week  Which form of 
exercise should

expressed in Part 5.2.3  above, except for 
brackets or ranges rather than ORed cases.  
Based on the best practice, a better solution for 
the example above might be as presented in 
Figure  P5-6. 
Figure P 5-6. Revised Decision Table Eliminating ORs

Sunday  health

Elimination of the ORs in Figure P5 -6 has 
resulted in repetition of outcomes. For example, 
treadmill  appears in five decision cells . Related 
observation s: 
• Decision tables are not required to show a 
different outcome for each decision rule . 
Each decision rule is entitled to its own 
outcome even if that outcome is the same 
as for other decision rules.   
• Suppose the outcome treadmill  needed to 
be changed  in every decision rule, say to 
aerobic dance . A global replace would 
suffice to make the change.  
Note:  Changing multiple outcomes is not 
the same as renaming  the underlying 
potential outcome . For the latter, the best approach is coordination through a 
struct ured business vocabulary  (concept 
model ). Refer to Part 4.1.3.  
• If each of the decision rules is required  to 
have the same outcome, an outcome 
restriction  should be specified. Refer to  
Part 3.6.  
Common -Outcome Symbol . In larger decision 
tables, repetitio n of a rather long outcome can 
be distracting.  
If desired, a placeholder symbol, say an X, can 
stand -in for an oft -repeated outcome. That way 
non-X outcomes show up much better.  
The meaning of the common -outcome symbol 
(i.e., what outcome it represents) can be 
specified either in a decision box  or within the 
decision table itself.  
Contraction/Expansion . Automated support is 
desirable for optionally contracting/expanding 
larger decision tables based on ORs.  
For example, such support might automatically 
convert the decision table in Figure P5 -6 back 
into the one in Figure P5 -5. The resulting 
contraction  can assist in detecting overall 
patterns, especially general rules .  
Refer to Part 5.9 for discussion of 
contraction/expansion for decision tables based 
on subsumption . Addressing ORs within  
elemental cases as in Figures P 5-5 and P 5-6 is 
simply a special case of subsumption.  
5.4 TABLESPEAK GUIDE LINES FOR 
COMPOSING OUTCOMES  
In the majority of decision tables , outcomes  are 
simply quantities, names, or individua l words 
Part 5: Designing High -Quality Decision Tables  
 
© 2013 Business Rule Solutions, LLC. www.BRSolutions.com . All rights reserved.   64 / 121 (e.g., yes, no ). Outcomes can be more complex, 
however. For example, outcomes can be some:  
• arithmetic expression or formula  
• phrase or sentence  in natural language  
• name for  another decision table  
• icon (For an example refer to Table P 5-1.) 
If an outc ome is the name of a computed or 
derived concept, then some other decision 
table or business rule  should indicate how to 
compute or derive it.  
For example, Figure P4-7 shows pre-owned 
product price  being computed by a second 
decision table. Such connectio ns reflect logical 
dependencies .  
5.4.1 Outcomes Embedding ORs  
Although ORs among outcomes is a tricky issue 
in logic, they are perfectly acceptable in 
business.  For example, the outcome  jogging  or 
soccer  might be specified as a suitable form of 
exercise , say on Thursday  when it’s not rainy .  
Such specification,  incidentally, would not 
indicate that only one form of exercise per day 
is permitted. Any such limitation should be 
stated separately as an explicit  outcome 
restriction . 
5.4.2 Outcomes Embedding AND s 
Outcomes composed in a way that embeds 
some AND(s) raise special concerns. Among 
these concerns is reduced responsiveness to 
change. Figure P5 -7 illustrates.  
 
 
  
Figure P5 -7. An Example of Outcomes with ANDs   day of  week  Which form of

Saturday  health 
club, 5 00 golf, 600 
Sunday  health 
club, 400 golf, 400 
 
Observations  
• In this revision of Figure P 5-6 a new number 
has been inserted alongside each outcome. 
What that number represents is currently a 
mystery. More about this mystery number 
momentarily.  
• The comm as in each cell presumably 
represent ANDs. The layout of the decision 
table would therefore seem to indicate that 
for any given intersection case  both the 
form of exercise  and the mystery number 
apply.  
In general, any outcome in a decision table that 
embed s an AND should be examined carefully. 
(An exception is if the AND is naturally part of 
some name – for example, hide and seek .)  
At issue is the possibility of change. For 
example, for the decision Which form of

consider whether an exercise companion is 
involved – i.e., to add exercise companion as 
a consideration .  
• The mystery number in Figure P5 -7 remains 
independent of this new consideration .  
How should the revised decision log ic be 
accommodated? The underlying problem with 
the decision table in Figure P5 -7 is that the 
question the decision logic answers is no longer 
aligned with the outcomes. Clearly numbers are 
not any form of exercise .  
TableSpeak Best Practice  
Fundamental a lignment bet ween question 
and outcomes in a decision table should be  
maintained rigorously at all times .  
If maintaining alignment between questions and 
outcomes in a decision table proves 
problematic, return to higher -level decision 
analysis  (DecisionSpea k). To continue the example, suppose the mystery 
number in Figure P5 -7 proves to represent the 
goal for exercising in terms of calories burned .  
This outcome reflects a different operational 
business decision  than selecting the 
appropriate form of exercise . The two 
operational business decisions need to be 
distinguished. TableSpeak  puts it this way:  
Different kinds of outcome – different 
questions, different decisions.  
Figure P5 -8 provides appropriate revisions to 
the decision logic presented in Figure P5 -7. Two 
distinct decision tables are evident, each with 
an appropriate question.  
The revision also includes the new 
consideration exercise c ompanion  for 
determining the form of exercise  (incomplete).

Most  operational busine ss decisions are  about 
selecting specific  outcomes  that are either:   
• Some  individual concept (e.g., John Smith ). 
• Some computed or derived concept (e.g., 
total price ).  
Showing a general concept as an outcome (e.g., 
country ) should be analyzed carefully. In effect, 
the outcome represents an implicit AND among 
all instances of the concept. Is that result  really 
intended?  Doubtful.  5.5 REDUNDANCIES, MU LTIPLE OUTCOMES, 
AND CONFLICTS  
Anomalies  among business rules  are a well -
known issue. 17 By the way, declarative  
representation of business rules does not 
somehow cause  anomalies. Just the opposite, it 
makes anomalies far e asier to detect compared 
to procedural  representation.  
Three important kinds of anomalies  in decision 
tables  are discussed in Table P5 -3, which also 
examines implications for intersection -style  and 
row-or-column -style  decision tables.  These 
anomalies all  arise from lack of uniqueness for

note   Uniqueness of intersection cases  
is a product o f the physical 
structure of the matrix. There is 
always one and only one 
decision cell  for each 
intersection case.  Anomalies of 
the kinds listed below  are either 
unlikely to occur or easy to spot.  Uniqueness of intersection cases 
must be strictly enforced (usually by 
software). Otherwise, in decision 
tables of any size, rows representing 
the very same intersection cases may 
prove hard to spot and the kinds of 
anomalies listed below can easily 
occur.  (The same  applies for columns

place.  A new row can be added that 
addresses the same intersection case 
as an existing row. If the outcomes of 
the existing and the new rows are 
mutually exclusive, a conflict arises.

being single -hit). 
5.5.1 More about Multiple Outcomes  
Operational business decisions  examined in 
decision analysis  under DecisionSpeak  and 
TableSpeak  usually have one and only  one 
outcome  for each relevant case.  
Multiple outcomes for a case can cause 
confusion about what the correct outcome 
really is – even if the outcomes are not mutually 
exclusive (i.e., not in conflict). In other words 
multiple outcomes can reduce certainty  of 
outcome  and also can result in inconsistent 
decisions.  Cases with multiple outcomes should 
be examined carefully.  
• If the outcomes are of different kinds, more 
than one question (operational business 
decision) is probably involved. Those 
questions shou ld be analyzed separately.  
• If an OR is intended (i.e., either outcome is 
acceptable), the OR should be expressed 
explicitly.  
• An intentional AND between multiple 
outcomes of the same kind are rare for 
problems addressed by decision analysis. 
Perhaps a cons ideration is missing for one 
of the outcomes.  
5.5.2 Resolving  Conflicts  
The prevention, detection and elimination of 
conflicts are extremely important requirements 
for operational business decisions addressed by 
decision analysis. If undetected, conflicts can 
lead directly to inconsistent decisions. In 
general, only business people or business 
analysts can resolve conflicts.  5.6 OMISSIONS – MISSING DECISION RUL ES 
Omissions  (missing decision rules) are an 
anomaly  of significant concern in decision 
analysis . A decision table  that lacks some  
decision rule(s)  is not complete. Certainty of 
outcome  is compromised.  The decision logic  
has holes.   
Omissions in decision tables can occur for any of 
the reasons enumerated in Table P 5-4. The table 
also discusses:  
• appropr iate remedies.  
•  implications for intersection -style  and row-
or-column -style  decision tables.  
In addition to the remedies suggested in Table 
P5-4, other important ways in which omissions 
in a decision table can be addressed are to 
specify some:  
• general rule (s).  
• exception(s).  Refer to Part 3.2 for 
discussion.  
• default (s). Refer to Part 3.3 for discussion.  
As indicated in Table P5 -4, one reason for 
omissions is that a decision table is not 
exhaustive  with respect to intersection cases .  
Remember that being ex haustive is not the 
same thing as being non -redundant. A decision 
table can exhibit no redundancy  with respect to 
intersection cases  without being exhaustive  – 
and vice versa.  Refer to Part 5.5 for additional 
discussion.  
Part 5: Designing High -Quality Decision Tables  
 
© 2013 Business Rule Solutions, LLC. www.BRSolutions.com . All rights reserved.   68 / 121 TableSpeak B est Practice  
Ensure that decision tables are both 
exhaustive and non -redundant.  
Completeness in decision tables (in any style) is 
based on exhaustively addressing all elemental 
cases and all intersection cases. It is  not based 
on simply addressing all pote ntial outcomes  at 
least once.   
For this reason TableSpeak  generally does not 
recommend organizing decision tables around 
common or similar outcomes  (except perhaps 
during initial capture). L exicographical order  is 
preferred.  TableSpeak Best Practice  
Do not hing in the format of a decision table 
that will detract from achieving 
completeness with respect to elemental and 
intersection cases.  
5.6.1 Sparse Style of Decision Tables  
Decision tables with a small number of 
potential outcomes , often just two, occasion ally 
feature a significant preponderance of some 
outcome(s)  in comparison to some other 
outcomes(s). For example, yes as an outcome 
might be 10 or 50 or a 100 times more common 
than no.  Table P5 -4 Omiss ions in Decision Tables and Remedies

Part 5: Designing High -Quality Decision Tables  
 
© 2013 Business Rule Solutions, LLC. www.BRSolutions.com . All rights reserved.   69 / 121 To visually highlight some rare or unusual 
outcome(s) such decision t ables are sometimes 
presented in sparse style .  
In sparse style all intersection cases are 
deliberately omitted except for those with the 
rare or unusual outcome(s).  The usual 
prescrip tion against missing decision rules is  
relaxed.  Refer to discussion of Figure P5 -10 for  
an example.  
So that there are no gaps in decision logic, 
TableSpeak  recommends that the sparse style 
be used only where one of the following is true:  
• The decision table is specified as a 
preemption table  (as in Part 5.7). 
• Some default(s)  and/or outcome restriction  
for the c ommon or usual outcome(s) are  
specified . (An outcome restriction is 
specified in Figure P5 -10.) 
5.7 PREEMPTION LISTS  AND PREEMPTION 
TABLES  
Preemptions  can be complex for any of several 
reasons:  
• A logical expression of arb itrary complexity 
is specified to identify relevant cases . 
• A subset of relevant cases for a many -case 
consideration  is significant in size.  
The latter often requires specification of one or 
more  preemption lists  or preemption tables . 
Each kind is discusse d and illustrated 
individually below.  
5.7.1 Preempti on Lists  
A preemption list  is simply a special form of  
relevance restriction  in which a long list of cases is required (typically four or more) . Figure 
P5-9 provides examples.  
Figure P5 -9 includes three p reemption lists. 
(Since there are tens of thousands of zip codes , 
the three preemption lists are presumably not 
at all typical in size.) The lists respectively 
indicate that the business chooses not to ship 
orders in the following cases : 
• Any order to zip c odes  04401  or 04740 . 
• Any order involving a tube  to zip codes  
00410 or 04730 to 04739  
• Any order involving a box in the summer  to 
zip codes  99928 to 99929  or 99950 . 
Observations  
• The three preemption lists are specified 
separately from the decision table  and 
referenced by name.  
• Each list specifies cases ( zip codes ) to which 
orders are not to be shipped according to 
qualifications included in the name of the 
list.  
For example, the qualifications for the 
preemption list at the upper right are boxes  
and summ er.  
• All intersection cases  in the main decision 
table corresponding to entries in the 
preemption lists show the outcome  n/a (not 
applicable ).  
If an order falls into a cell indicating it 
cannot be shipped, a price for shipping that 
order obviously should not be given. Such a 
case is preempted ; that is, no outcome for it 
is meaningful. (Refer to Appendix 7 for 
additional discussion of n/a.)

• All preempted cells have also been grayed -
out.  
Gray -out indicates no direct revision 
(updati ng) is permitted (at least until the 
preemption is lifted, if ever).  For convenience, different colors of shading 
have been applied for the gray -out to show 
which intersection cases have been 
preempted by which preemption list.  
• Each entry in each p reempt ion list results in

entry in this fashion allows single -sourcing  
of business intent.   
If revision is desired to a preemption list 
(either to drop some zip code(s) or to  add 
some), the preemption list provides a single 
point of change.  
• If a preemption list would be significantly 
shorter were it to include zip codes  to which 
orders are sent (an inclusion list ), rather 
than ones to which they are not sent (an 
exclusion lis t), the former may be used 
instead.  
Which kind of list is best for any given 
situation is simply a matter of preference 
(and proper specification).  
5.7.2 Preempti on Table s 
Preemptions can sometimes be highly specific 
or selective . Specify ing each preempti on 
individually  can be cumbersome  and wordy.  A 
special preempt ion table  may substitute .  
A preemption table  is a deci sion table set up 
specifically to preempt  cases in another decision 
table.  Naturally, the considerations for the respective 
decision tables must be parallel.  
As an example , suppose the business does not 
ship orders where:  
• The zip code  is from 99928 to 99929 , the 
weight  is 0kg ≤ wt < 1 kg, the kind of 
packaging  is tube , and the season  is not 
summer .  
• The zip c ode is 00401 , the weight  is 3kg ≤ wt 
< 4kg , the kind of packaging  is box, and the 
season  is summer . 
• The zip code  is from 99928 to 99929 , the 
weight  is 4kg ≤ wt < 5 kg, the kind of 
packaging  is tube , and the season  is 
summer . 
These specifications could be in dividually listed 
as preemptions in the decision table in Figure 
P5-9.  
As illustrated in Figure P 5-10, however, a more 
convenient approach is to create a separate 
preemption table and to simply reference it by 
name from the former decision table.

Part 5: Designing High -Quality Decision Tables

• Figure  P5-10 is organized along the same 
lines as the main decision table in Figure  
P5-9 – that is, in the same style and with the 
same considerations . 
• This decision table indicates whether an 
order  with certain c haracteristics can be 
shipped at all.  A no indicates it cannot.  
• Since most cases can be shipped  the 
decision table is shown in sparse style .  
In sparse style the usual prescription against 
missing intersection cases is relaxed. Only 
intersection case s with a specific outcome 
(e.g., a  no) are represented so that those 
specific cases really stand out.  
• An outcome restriction  has been specified 
to indicate that empty cells are to be 
interpreted as can be shipped .  
• Each of the three corresponding 
interse ction cases in the original  decision 
table should now show n/a (not applicable ) 
and be grayed -out. 
5.8 USE OF CONSIDERA TION RESTRICTIONS 
AGAINST UNKNOWNS  
A consideration restriction  can be used to 
answer the special pattern question : 
Can a decision  still b e made where does not 
matter (dash) applies and no elemental 
case  is presented ? 
Refer to Appendix 7 for discussion of  does not 
matter  (dash) as used in TableSpeak . Use of the 
symbol raises the issue of how to handle 
unknown s. This issue can arise only when  this 
special symbol appears.  Typically, decision logic  requires elemental 
cases for each consideration of an intersection 
case  to be present (known). If not, the 
appropriate outcome  cannot be selected and no 
decision can be made.  
Specifying does not matt er (dash), however, 
raises the following possibility. Since no 
elemental case for the consideration can 
possibly make a difference to the outcome, 
perhaps the absence of any  can b e tolerated.   
Consider the operational business decision  
What is the right d elivery method for an order? . 
Suppose does not matter (dash)  is specified in 
some intersection case for the hazardous 
materials  consideration. Which of the following 
is meant?  
1. There is no difference in outcome for 
any elemental case  that can be 
presented  – and that outcome still 
applies even if no elemental case at all 
is presented.  
2. There is no difference in outcome for 
any elemental case that can be 
presented – but some  elemental case 
must nonetheless still be presented.  
The latter version is the more re strictive so it 
requires additional specification . When absence 
is not tolerable the consideration restriction 
must be known  should be specified.  
As a result, some  elemental case must present 
itself for a decision to be made – even though 
the specific ele mental case is inconsequential to 
the outcome.  
Figure P5 -11 illustrates specification of must be 
known  for the hazardous materials  
consideration (purple cell).  
Part 5: Designing High -Quality Decision Tables  
 
© 2013 Business Rule Solutions, LLC. www.BRSolutions.com . All rights reserved.   73 / 121 A particular intersection case might not start off 
with a does not matter  (dash), but rather might 
acquire it later on as revisions to the decision 
table are made.  
• In Figure P5 -11, for example, the 
intersection case in the last row starts off 
yes for the hazardous materials 
consideration (see light -purple cell).  
• In Figure P5 -12 that specificatio n has 
changed to does not matter  (dash).  
The consideration restriction still requires a yes or no to be presented for any decision to be 
made.  
Specifying must be known  for a consideration is 
not the same as specifying some property (or 
field or attribute ) as mandatory:  
• A mandatory property must be known all 
the time . 
• A must be known consideration applies only 
at the specific time any decision is made.  
If a property must be known before or after  
some decision is made, some other business Figure P5 -11. Consideration Restriction Indicating Must Be Known

A consideration restriction specifying must be 
known  may be applied in decision tables  either 
to: 
• Some consideration as a whole (as in Figure 
P5-11 and P5 -12). Such specification applies 
individually to every intersection case.   
• Some particular intersection case.  
5.9 SUBSUMPTION IN D ECISION TABLES  
Subsumption  simply means that one thing is 
viewed or encompassed as a member of a 
larger class of things.  
In business rules , subsumption  occurs when a 
general rule  is recognized to cover exactly the 
same situation, and to give or require exactly 
the same result, as a more specific rule . An 
undetected subsumption (that is, a rule that 
could be subsumed) is always considered an 
anomaly .  
The matter is complicated a bit i n decision 
tables .  
Deliberate expansion  of decision tables – in effect reversing subsumptions (usually by 
software) – can be a useful technique for 
visualization and validation. Contraction/  
expansion of decision tables is discussed in  
Part 5 .10. 
5.9.1 Examples of Subsumption in Decision 
Tables  
The decision table in Figure P5 -13 illustrates 
potential subsumption. A new decision rule  (the 
new row in light purple at bottom) has been 
added to the  decision table in Figure P 2-7. 
This new decision rule is exac tly like the one in 
the row immediately above it in two respects. 
They both:  
• Pertain to platinum customers.  
• Have the same outcome , shipped by 
premium service . 
The new decision rule, however, is more general 
since it includes a does not matter  (dash) for all 
the other considerations .  
Since this new decision rule covers a broader 
set of intersection cases , but leads to the same 
outcome, the decision rule in the row above it is

within a contracted decision table as  illustrated 
in Figure P 5-14. 
Subsumptions are usually not so easy to detect 
as in the example above.  
Figure P5 -15 presents a somewhat more 
complicated example, also based on the original  
decision table in Figure P 2-7. Again, a new 
decision rule (the new row in light purple at 
bottom) has been added.  
This new decision rule is exactly like the one 
shown in the top row in two respects:  • They both cover exactly all the same 
elemental cases  – except for one, the 
elemental case pertaining to the 
consideration hazardous materials . 
• They both have the same outcome , picked 
up by customer . 
With regard to that one difference  pertaining to 
hazardous materials , the new row shows the 
elemental case yes, whereas the top row shows 
the elemental case no. Since both yes and no 
lead to the same outcome, these two decision 
rules are subsumable into a more general rule 
(row).  Figure P5 -14. Contracted Decision Tab le Not Showing Subsumed Decision Rule

absorbed into one in the contracted decision 
table illustrated in Figure P5 -16.  
This decision table shows the consolidated 
decision rule (highlighted in light purple in the 
top row) with a does not matter  (dash) for the 
hazardous materials  consideration.  
5.10 CONTRACTION/EXPANSIO N OF 
DECISION TABLES  
Contraction  of a decision table is based on 
detecting and consolidating subsumptions 
(usually by software).  
Expansion  of a decision table does the opposite 
– more specific decision rules are shown 
individually  even if subsumable.  
Figure P5 -17 illustrates . Observations : 
• The expanded version of the decision table 
on the far left shows every possible 
combination (intersection case) of three 
binary considerations n, m and q, along with 
the appropriate outcome for each 
combination.  
• The decision table in th e middle highlights 
the subsumable decision rules on which contraction/expansion of the decision table 
can be based.  
• The contracted version of the decision table 
is presented on the far right. A does not 
matter  (dash) now appears for each 
elemental case in  the rows that result from 
consolidation of the subsumable decision 
rules.  
Additional Notes  
• The set of intersection cases for all three 
versions of the decision table in Figure P5 -
17 is considered unique (i.e., to satisfy the 
single -hit principle).  
• Contrac tion of a decision table can either be 
partial (i.e., only to more specific rules that 
have previously appeared), or complete 
(i.e., to all more specific rules possible, even 
if ones that  have never appeared  before).   
• The contracted version of the decision table 
at the far right might be useful in spotting 
general rules. Does the bottom row in that 
decision table represent some deeper 
business intent? If so, an outcome 
restriction  to give it  protection  might be 
specified . Refer to Part 5.11 for discussion . Figure P 5-16. Contracted Decision Table with Consolidation of Subsumable Decision Rules

5.11 USING  OUTCOME RESTRICTIONS  TO 
ENFORCE GENERAL RULE S IN EXPANDED 
DECISION TABLES  
An outcome restriction  can be used to answer 
the special pattern question : 
Does a  general rule  still apply even if it 
disappears in expanding a  decision table ?  
Refer to Part 5.10 for discussion of 
contraction/expansion of decision tables. Such 
manipulations typically involve the special 
symbol does not matter (dash) . Refer to 
Appendix 7  for discussion of  does not matter  
(dash) as used in TableSpeak .  
In expansion of a decisio n table, general rules 
are no longer visible. Each is replaced by a set of 
more specific rule(s) . In effect, each general rule 
is either partially or completely unsubsumed.  
The more specific rules can be individually  
modified, perhaps producing outcomes 
inconsistent with the original (but now invisible) 
general rule. Business intent can be lost in this 
fashion.  
The outcome restriction protected  can be 
specified for any general rule in a decision table. The restriction ensures the original business 
intent embodied in the general rule is retained.  
Consequently, the general rule:  
• Remains in effect  even if it disappears  in 
expanding a  decision table . 
• Is applied to all the more specific rule(s)  
produced from it.  
• Dictates the outcomes all the more specific 
rule(s) produced from it. (The outcomes 
must all be the same as for the general 
rule.)  
The pattern question above can thus be 
reworded:  
Can a more specific rule  produced through 
expansion of a decision table be modified 
(updated) directly such that its outcom e is 
different than for the more general rule?  
To illustrate, let’s return to the decision table 
presented in Figure P5 -16, which was a 
contracted version of the decision table in 
Figure P5-15.  
Consolidation of the two subsumable decision 
rules in the latter Figure resulted in the general 

Part 5: Designing High -Quality Decision Tables

specified for that rule. Figure P5 -18 illustrates.  
This contracted decision table could be 
expanded ( unsubsumed) into the decision table 
shown in Figure P5 -19.  
• The two more specific rules have 
reappeared (in the top and bottom rows).  • The general rule is now hidden.  
Even so, the protection  specif ied for the general 
rule still applies. Neither  of the two new  more 
specific  rules, both grayed -out, can be modified  
until such time th at protection  is discontinued, if 
ever. That original business intent is retained .

© 2013 Business Ru le Solutions, LLC. www.BRSolutions.com . All rights reserved.   80 / 121 APPENDIX 1 : WHAT TABLESPEAK IS  
TableSpeak  is a set of conventions for business -
friendly representation of decision tables  and 
their meaning (semantics) in declarative  
fashion.  
Central to TableSpeak are:  
• Highly pragmatic guidelines and thresholds 
for selecting the best decision -table format. 
TableSpeak avoids simplistic and 
counterproductive one -size-fits-all 
approaches.  
• The principle of single -sourcing , essential 
for achieving true business agility.  
• Restrictions  – business rules  for ensuring 
the integrity (correctness) of decision -table  
content.  
TableSpeak optimizes for readability by non -IT 
professionals and business people:  
• The question the decision ta ble answers is 
always emphasized.  
• Scope (applicability) is declared explicitly.  
• Unnecessary complications to decision -
table structure (such as exceptions ) are 
externalized.  
• Meaning is comprehensively expressed.  
• Business vocabulary is carefully used.  
Deci sion tables based on TableSpeak are free of 
hidden assumptions and implicit interpretation 
semantics.  
TableSpeak is fundamentally based on words 
(semantics) and explicit rules . It is suitable for representing decision logic  anytime you need to 
know why you  get the results you get in words . 
Refer to Appendix 2 in the companion Primer on 
DecisionSpeak  for additional discussion of this 
guiding principle.19

USEFUL IN ANALYZING OR COMMUNICATING DEC ISION 
LOGIC  
Severa l kinds of tables other than decision 
tables  are potentially useful in analyzing or 
communicating decision logic .  
A2.1 LOOK -UP TABLES  
In TableSpeak , a look -up table  is a table whose 
content is populated by so me mathematical 
formula.  
The look -up table is provided as matter of 
convenience, so people can ‘look up’ the pre -
computed result of a computation rather than 
compute it themselves on -the-spot. Tax tables, 
for example, are often look -up tables.  
Table A -1 summarizes key differences between 
decision tables and look -up tables.  
The formula for a look -up table is preferably 
expressed as a computation -type business rule . 
Hint:  The formula for a look -up table often 
can be found in a footnote, at the end of 
the ta ble, or in the accompanying 
instructions .  
Frequently the formula is given in the context of what to do if the case  of interest 
falls outside the range (s) of the 
consideration(s)  the table explicitly covers.  
A2.2 SCENARIO TABLES  
In TableSpeak , a scenario  table  (also called a 
case table ) is a table whose content  specifies 
cases  relevant to an operational business 
decision , but not the appropriate outcomes  for 
them.  
A scenario table can be used to:  
• Brainstorm outcomes.  
• Explore what format of decision table  
works best for some decision logic . 
• Discover scope items , defaults , exceptions , 
and restrictions . 
A scenario table for the decision table in Figure 
P1-6 is presented in Figure A -1. For convenience 
the relevant (intersection) cases  have been 
numbered and h ighlighted in purple.

RULE -PER-COLUMN DECISION TABL ES 
The decision logic  for the What is the right 
delivery method for an order?  decision table  
presented in Figure P2 -7 in one-rule-per-row 
style is given in Figure A -3 as a one-rule-per-
column  decision table.  
As preferred under TableSpeak , the outcomes  
for each of the intersection cases  have been 
placed at the top of each column rather than 
the bott om. 
Observations  
• Seven few -case considerati ons are listed 
from top to bottom in the left -most column 
(instead of along the top row ). 
• Three intersection cases  are s hown in each 
of three columns to the right (instead of in 
three rows ). 
• The appropriate outcom e for each of the 
three intersection cases, the particular delivery method for order , is sh own at the 
top of each column (instead of to the right 
of each row ). 
• Each complete column (instead of each 
complete row) holds  one decision rule . 
These rules could (again) be verbalized 
individually as in Appendix 4 . 
A3.1 CAUTIONS USING THE ON E-RULE-PER-
COLUMN STYLE  
The one -rule-per-column style is not without 
certain dangers.  
For example at first glance, Figure A -3 might 
seem complete because a ll three potential 
outcomes for delivery method for order  are 
listed atop the three right columns.  Figure A -3. One -Rule -Per-Column Decision Table for the Operational Business Decision

© 2013 Business Rule Solutions, LLC. www.BRSolutions.com . All rights reserved.   84 / 121 But this decision table is far from complete! 
Refer to Appendix 5 for discussion.  
Completeness in decision tables in any style is 
based on exhaustively addr essing all elemental 
cases and all intersection cases, not simply 
addressing all potential outcomes at least once.  
Quite often different decision rules, ones that 
cannot be subsumed, produce the very same 
outcome.  
So anticipate that a one -rule-per-column  
decision table will show the same outcome 
more than once across the top  (or bottom) .  
Should columns (decision rules) with the same 
outcome be shown in the decision table side -
by-side?  
That approach is generally not recommended 
except perhaps during  initial captu re. 
Lexicographical order  is preferred overall. The 
TableSpeak prescription is:  
Do nothing in the format of a decision table 
that will detract from achieving 
completeness with respect to  
elemental and intersection cases.

Decision Tables : A Primer – How to Use Table SpeakTM 
 
© 2013 Business Ru le Solutions, LLC. www.BRSolutions.com . All rights reserved.   87 / 121 APPENDIX 5: SAMPLE ASSESSMENT OF  THE 
COMPLETENESS OF A DECISION TABLE   
The true completeness  of any decision table  
cannot be determined without inspecting the 
underlying structured business vocabulary  
(concept model ).  
Suppose t he business vocabulary for the 
decision table in Figure P2 -7 indicates semi -
fragile  to be an additional elemental case  
alongside fragile . If so, the decision table is 
incomplete.  
A5.1 APPARENT COMPLETENES S 
The apparent completeness  of a decision table 
– completeness without reference to underlying 
structured business vocabulary  (concept model ) 
– can be calculated  mathematically (preferably 
by software).  
For example, the apparent completeness  of the 
decision table  in Figure P2 -7 can be calculated 
as follows  (in three steps) . 
Step 1. The total number of possible  
intersection cases  is calculated as  follows.  
• Six considerations  apparently have two 
elemental cases  each ( yes and no for all 
except destination of order, which shows 
local  and remote ).  
• The seventh, category of customer , 
apparently has three elemental cases 
(silver , gold , and platinum ).  
Therefore the total number of possible  distinct 
intersection cases  is calculated as:  26 × 3 = 192.  This total of course assumes that the business 
vocabulary  confirms  the actual number of 
possible elemental cases for destination of 
order  and category of customer  to be two and 
three, respectively.  
Step 2. The total number of intersection cases 
actually covered in the current version of the 
decision table can be determin ed as follows.  
One row, the second from the bottom, covers 
exactly one intersection case – each cell in that 
row has something in it other than a does not 
matter  (dash).  
The other two rows are a bit more complicated 
because both have one or more cells wi th does 
not matter  (dashes). These rows represent 
general rules .  
• The first ( row just below the considerations ) 
includes one such cell, so that row provides 
the outcome  for two intersection cases – 
one if the cell had local  and one if it had 
remote .  
• The b ottommost row includes three such 
cells, so that row provides the outcome for 
23 or 8 intersection cases.  
Altogether, the decision table therefore covers 
11 distinct intersection cases ( 2 + 1 + 8 = 11). 
Step 3. The apparent completeness of the 
decision ta ble is calculated as follows.  
The number of  intersection cases the decision 
table does not cover  is: 192 – 11 = 181. So 181 
possible distinct intersection cases are not 
Appendix 4: Verbalization of Decision Rules

general rule.  
Clearly this decision table is not very 
complete(!).  
A5.2 DECISION RULE CAPTUR E TABLE  
The table  in Figure P2 -7 is so far from complete 
some practitioners would not call it a “decision 
table ” at all.  
Instead, it might be describe d as a decision rule 
captur e table  (sometimes  decision grid chart ) – 
simply a  tabular list of certain intersection cases 
and associated outcomes .  
A possible use c ould be to initially capture and 
specify some decision  rules  – perhaps to some 
tool.   
Decision Tables : A Primer – How to Use Table SpeakTM 
 
© 2013 Business Ru le Solutions, LLC. www.BRSolutions.com . All rights reserved.   89 / 121 APPENDIX 6: ILLUSTRATION OF THE NUMBER OF ROWS 
IN A ONE -RULE -PER-ROW -STYLE DECISION TABLE  
In a row-or-column -style  decision table  every 
decision rule  is represented by a row (or by a 
column ).  
How many rows (or columns) would be required  
for the What should be charg ed for shipping an 
order?  decision table in Figure P2 -3?  
That decision logic  includes three many -case 
considerations : 
• There are approximately 43,000 zip codes  in 
the United States.22  
• Let’s say the weight  consideration  involves 
100 elemental case s. 
• There a re twelve months .  
Multiplying 43,000  ×100 × 12 produces  
51,600,0 00 rows (or columns)!  
Note s 
1. An intersection -style  decision table for 
this same decision logic could also need 
that many decision cells . Such a 
decision table could be massive in its 
own way.  An intersection -style decision 
table, however, would not have any 
redundancy of elemental cases .  
2. Change in elemental cases is always a 
concern. For example, do  zip codes  ever 
change? In fact the total number of zip 
codes  can fluct uate by a few thousand  
                                                           
22 http://www.carrierroutes.com/ZIPCodes.html , 
available March, 2013  annually .23 The ability to manage such 
change effectively is crucial.   
For the sake of argument, let’s say you find ways 
to consolidate the decision logic.  
For example, for every decision rule you need to 
keep, let’s say there are 999 you can eliminate 
becau se they produce the same outcome .  
That’s a reducti on by three orders of magnitude 
to 51,600 rows or columns  in the row -or-
column -style . You are going to need (good!) 
automation to represent and manage that 
many.

Decision Tables : A Primer – How to Use Table SpeakTM 
 
© 2013 Business Ru le Solutions, LLC. www.BRSolutions.com . All rights reserved.   90 / 121 APPENDIX 7: SPECIAL KEYWORDS AND  SYMBOLS IN 
TABLESPEAK  
TableSpeak  uses a minimal set of special 
keywords and symbols whose meaning is 
explained below.  
A7.1 ABOUT THE MEANING OF THE SPECIAL 
OUTCOME ‘NONE ’ 
The special keyword none  appears in one of the 
decision cells  of the decision table  in Figur e P1 -
1 (and other Figures).   
None  is obviously not a coat, but is a legitimate 
outcome  nonetheless.  A subtle implication is 
that the set of potential outcomes  is broader 
(by one instance) than th e actual class of the 
outcomes, coat . 
None  mean s no coat need  be worn . It does not 
mean “the question cannot be decided” or “not 
known”.  
In other words, ‘none ’ does  provide a definitive 
outcome; it does  answer the question  the 
decision table addresses . No breach of scope 
occurs when none  appears.  
A7.2 ABOUT THE MEANING OF THE SPECIAL  
SYMBOL  ‘—’ 
A dash in a cell of a decision table where an 
elemental case  would otherwise appear  means 
does not matter . The does not matter  symbol 
(dash) is used widely in decision tables and is 
not unique to TableSpeak . 
Used correctly a  does not matter  (dash) is a 
means by which the number of intersection cases  in a decision table can be kept as low as 
possible.  
In the one-rule-per-row style  that means the 
fewest number of rows. Refer to Part 5.10 for 
discussion of contraction/expansion  of decision 
tables.  
A does not matter  (dash) in a cell of a decision 
table indicates that the decision logic  accepts 
anything  there:  
• Any elemental case.  
• Nothing at all , which effectively means 
unknown . 
If unknown is not deemed desirable, a 
consideration restriction  should be specified. 
Refer to Part 5.8 for discussion.  
In effect, a does not matter (dash) represents an 
implicit OR between all elemental cases of a 
given consideration  (plus unknown).  For 
example if the consideration is Boolean, the 
meaning of a dash is understood as yes OR no  
OR unknown.  
Creating an intersection case with a does not

A7.3 ABOUT THE MEANING OF THE SPECI AL 
TABLESPEAK OUTCOME  ‘N/A’  
The TableSpeak symbol n/a (not applicable)  
indicates no outcome for a case is appropriate 
because the case has been specifically 
precluded by a restriction.  
Appendix 7: Special Keywords and Symbols in TableSpeak  
 
© 2013 Business Rule Solutions, LLC. www.BRSolutions.com . All rights reserved.   91 / 121 The symbol n/a can be viewed as definitive. In 
effect an n/a says, “This case is recognized as 
being a  case in scope , but the correct answer to 
the question being asked is that there is no 
answer to the question in this case.”  
Cases indicated as n/a instead having a normal 
outcome are not exceptions  of any kind – they 
do not use different considerations in  their 
determination.

The classic style of decision table  in software 
engineering is called limited entry decision 
table . It was standardized in 1982.24  
A related style is called extended entry decisi on 
table . Both styles are discussed and illustrated 
individually below.  
A8.1 LIMITED ENTRY DECISI ON TABLE S 
The essential feature of the limited entry style is 
that elemental cases  and outcomes  – both 
called entries  – are strictly limited to binary 
choices.  (The reason presumably was partly to 
keep memory requirements to a minimum.)  
The decision table from Figure P1 -1 is illustrated 
in classic limited entry style in Figure A -5.25 The 
symbols in the table mean:  
C – condition  
A – action  
R – rule (condition -action)  
X – ‘do this’

C1 raining  Y Y N 
C2 cold  Y N Y 
A1 wear lined raincoat  X   
A2 wear unlined raincoat   X  
A3 wear wool overcoat    X 
 
Observations  
• In Figure A -5 both elemental ca ses ( Y and N) 
and outcomes ( X and empty) are binary 
(and single characters) – hence the name 
limited entry  decision table . 
• The style is not at all business -friendly.  
Interpreting the decision table correctly 
requires distinguishing its four basic 
quadrant s, and then, keeping all the special 
symbols in mind, essentially reading 
clockwise starting from the upper left 
quadrant.  
• Since the binary restriction does not permit 
numbers (other than 0 or 1), limited entry 
decision tables have traditionally been 
closely associated with logic and formal 
reasoning, rather than broader business 
decision -making.  
• The actions in the table are procedural  and 
permit both real -world actions and program 
control actions (including the traditional 
programming return  or go back ). Generally 
a top -to-bottom ‘execution’ order is 
assumed.

© 2013 Business Rule Solutions, LLC. www.BRSolutions.com . All rights reserved.   93 / 121 • ‘Wear no coat’ ( none ) is not present in the 
decision table because no action is required 
in that case . 
A limited entry decision  table  can be purely 
declarative . As illustrated by Figure A -6 at least 
two revisions are appropriate:  
• The A for action  changed to O for the 
preferred TableSpeak  term  outcome . 
• The imperative verb “wear” dropped from 
each outcome.

C2 cold?  Y N Y N 
O1 lined raincoat  X    
O2 unlined raincoat   X   
O3 wool overcoat    X  
O4 none     X 
 
Most experts deem the limited entry style 
simply outdated. It’s also known to be subject 
to certain kinds of undesirable de pendencies.  
A8.2 EXTENDED ENTRY DECISION TABLE S 
The advantages of relaxing the restriction to 
binary ‘entries’ has long been recognized. Extended entry decision tables  permit elemental 
cases or outcomes (or both) to be non -binary.  
An example of an exten ded entry decision table 
with non -binary elemental cases is given in 
Figure A -7, which is based on Figure P 4-2.  
Observations  
• The consideration temperature level?  is now 
not binary. It has three elemental cases – 
cold, moderate and warm .  
• Single -character ‘entries’ Y and N for 
precipitation ? have been replaced by the 
actual elemental cases – rainy and not rainy.  
Note the large number of decision cells  in 
Figure A -7. There are 36 (in light blue), most 
empty.  And this is a relatively small example.  
An obvious  problem for this style of decision 
table is the large number of decision cells it can 
produce .  
If there are p number of intersection cases  and 
q number of potential outcomes , there can be 
as many as  p × q  number of decision cells. 
(There are 6 × 6 =  36 in Figure A -7.)  
The actual number of decision cells might be 
considerably smaller  of course  if the decision 
table is consolidated through contraction.  Refer 
Figure A -7. Extended Entry Decision Table with Non -Bina ry Elemental Cases

contraction (and expansion).  
In any case, t he number of potential outcomes 
obviously needs to be kept relatively low in this 
style. Some practitioners would permit 10 to 20 
potential outcomes; a more reasonable 
threshold is probably 4 or 5. 
Although the style used in Figure A -7 might be 
useful for certain problems, especially logic -
intensive ones, TableSpeak  generally does not 
recommend it for business use.  
A8.3 THE ROOTS OF AL L ROW -OR-COLUMN -
STYLE DECISION TABLE S 
All limited entry and extended entry decision 
tables are special cases of the one-rule-per-
column  style.  This fact becomes obvious when both  elemental 
cases and outcomes are ‘extended’. Figure A -8, 
a revision of Figure A -7, illustrates.  
In Figure A -8 the six outcomes have been 
‘extended’ – i.e., indicated as outcomes directly 
in the decisi on table (instead of indirectly, using 
X’s as in Figure A -7). The original 36 decision 
cells have now been reduced to six.  
Remember that the one -rule-per-column and 
one-rule-per-row styles are really just variations 
of the same basic approach, the row-or-
column -style .  
Does it become clear now that the roots of this 
style lie in software?

dependencies.  
 Structured business 
vocabulary  is always 
carefully  used.  
No compromises are made, 
however, in the accuracy and 
completeness of the decision 
rule(s)  with respect to  the 
subject matter. There is never 
any hidden or assumed 
interpretation semantics.  
5. DecisionSpeak  is 
fundamentally based on words 
(semantic s) and explicit rules . 
It is suitable  for decision 
analysis  anytime  you need to 
know why you get the results 
you get in words . 
6. DecisionSpeak  is part of  
IPSpeak . 
7. The natural follow -on to  
DecisionSpeak  is TableSpeak , 
with which  DecisionSpeak  is 
closely  aligned.  
decision structure  how one or more 
operational business 
decisions  are formally 
organized   1. A decision structure  should 
indicate operational business 
decisions  that are dependent – 
i.e., consideration -dependent, 
relevance -dependent, and/or 
outcome -dependent.  
2. A Q-Chart  visually organizes 
a decision structure .  
decision table  a structured means of 
visualizing decision 
rules  in rows and 
columns   1. A decision table  identifies 
the appropriate outcome  for 
each case it covers.  
2. In a true decisi on table , 
outcomes  cannot be predicted 
by a formula. If the outcomes  
could, there would be no need 
for the decision table . 
3. Contrast with look -up table .

decision task  a task centered on 
making an operational 
business decision  – 
that is on deciding 
some thing rather than 
on doing something  A. Determine clothes 
to wear  
B. Determine sales 
tax on purchases  1. As recommended for all 
tasks, a decision task  should be 
named using a verb + noun (or 
noun phrase).  
2. A decision task  always 
involves a determination  of 
some kind – hence, 
DecisionSpeak  recommend s 
using the convention 
“Determine  …” to name a 
decision task . 
3. A decision task  often 
appears in a business process 
model (but does not have to).   
declarative  constituting a n 
expression or 
representation  that 
can be  either true or 
false   1. There is no implicit meaning 
(semantics) in declarative  
expressions or representations.  
2. Contrast to procedural . 
3. In graduate school in the 
early 1970s (the days of punch 
cards) I learned a highly 
pragmatic test for det ermining 
whether specifications are 
declarative : 
 Take each statement of the 
specifications and type it on 
an individual punch card.  
 Assemble the deck.  
 Test it to make sure it works.  
 Throw the whole deck up in 
the air.  
 Pick up all the cards in 
random or der. 
 Re-test it.  
If the logic still works, the 
statements are declarative .  If 
not, they are procedural .  The 
point is that in declarative  
specifications no logic is lost 
‘between the lines’ – i.e., none 
is intrinsic to the sequence of 
presentation.  In o ther words, 
there is no hidden meaning 
(semantics).  2: constituting a 
statement that can be  
either true or false  
default  
(decision rule)  a decision rule  or set 
of decision rules  that 
supplies the 
appropria te 
outcome(s)  for 
omissions  in a 
decision table   1. Defaults  are an  important 
means by which decision 
tables  can be simplified and 
kept as small as possible.  
2. A default  supplies some 
appropriate outcome(s)  if a 
decision table  does not 
address some case(s)  explicitly.  
3. (Some) default(s)  can be 
specifi ed for a decision table

to guarantee completeness . 
4. A default and an exception  
are not the same thing. A 
default  uses the ‘normal’ 
considerations  for a  decision 
table ; an exceptional case  
never does.  
5. Defaults  can be as simple as 
a single quantity or instance, or 
as complex as a separate 
decision table . 
6. Defaults should be used 
with caution. A default  might 
leave important cases  
unexamined that should have 
distinct outcomes  – especially 
as decision logic  evolves over 
time. Once (re)deployed, such 
un(re-)examined decision logic  
can produce unpleasant 
surprises.  
7. Specifying some default(s)  
for common or usual 
outcome(s)  can permit a 
decision table  to be 
represented in sparse style  
without any gaps in the 
decision logic .

exceptional case  a case in scope  that 
does not use the 
considerations  of a 
standard case ; i.e.,  a 
case in scope  that is 
based on some 
consideration(s)  that 
is/are not among the 
considerations  for a 
standard case  A. Halloween  
B. Food  
C. Auto insurance:  
 An applicant is 
convicted of a 
felony involving a 
motor vehicle.  
 An applicant for 
auto insurance is 
not 18 years of age 
or older.  
 The applicant is 
the boss’s 
daught er. 1. Special decision logic  must 
be developed for each 
exceptional case . 
2. The decision logic  for an 
exceptional case  might be as 
simple as a single decision rule  
(e.g., The boss’s daughter must 
be accepted for auto 
insurance. ), or significantly 
more co mplex.  
3. A default and an exception  
are not the same thing. A 
default  uses the ‘normal’ 
considerations  for a  decision 
table ; an exceptional case  
never does.  [exception] 2: one that 
is excepted or taken

are exhaustive . 
2. The cases:  
 colder than 11°C   
 11°C  ≤ 
temperature  ≤ 
27°C   
are not exhaustive.  1. A decision table  with 
missing elemental cases in 
scope  is likely to be 
incomplete. So is a decision 
table  with missing intersection 
cases .  
2. A decision table can exhibit 
no redundan cy with respect to 
intersection cases  without 
being exhaustive  – and vice 
versa.    
few-case 
consideration  a consideration  that 
involv es only two or 
three elemental cases   true? (yes, no)  
 fragile? (fragile, 
not fragile)  
 state of matter  
(solid, liquid, gas)  1. How many elemental cases  
a consideration  produc es is an 
important factor in selecting 
the best decision table  format.  
2. Contrast to many -case 
consideration . 
3. Also called a simple 
consideration .  
general rule  a decision rule  that 
covers more than one 
case  1. All shipments to 
Hawaii must cost the 
same, regardless of 
season, weight, 
packaging, etc.  
2. All shipments to 
Alaska in the winter 
cost the same, 
regardless of  weight, 
packaging, etc.  1. A general rule  covers many 
cases  in a single specification, 
treating all such cases 
uniformly.  
2. A general rule  often 
produce s an outcome  based 
on a proper subset of relevant 
considerations . 
3. Contrast with specific rule .   
gray -out (of cells

table)  the TableSpeak  
convention i ndicating 
that no revision 
(updating) is 
permitted for a cell in 
a decision table   1. Revision of grayed -out cells

logical 
dependency (in 
business rules)  an expression or 
representati on of 
business rules  using 
the name of 
something  computed 
or derived by another  
business rule  Rule 1. A rush order 
must not be 
suspended.  
Rule 2. An order is

rush if the delivery 
time due is less than 
24 hours from the 
time placed.  
Rule 1  is logically 
dependent on rule 2.  1. In business rules , a logical 
dependency  is always based

look -up table (in 
decision logic)  a table whose content 
is populated by some 
mathematical formula  Tax tables are often 
look-up tables.  1. A look -up table  is not a true 
decision table , in which 
outcom es cannot be predicted 
by a formula. (If the outcomes  
could, there would be no need 
for the decision table .)  
2. The production of a look -up 
table  is purely a matter of 
convenience, so that people 
can “look up” the result of a 
computation rather than 
compu te it themselves.  
2. The mathematical formula  
for a look -up table  is 
preferably expressed as a

consideration  a consideration  that 
produces four or more 
individual  cases   weight

multiple outcomes 
(for a decision 
rule)  the same case  having 
two or more 
outcomes  in one or 
more decision rules    Multiple outcomes  are of 
special concern if any of the 
following are true. T he 
outcomes :  
 Belong to  different 
classes , suggesting they 
answer different 
questions . 
 Are not explicitly or’ed or

about which apply.   
multi -table 
(representation 
for decision 
tables)  in the intersection 
style , using multiple 
tables to represent 
decision logic   1. The easiest way to think of a 
three -dimensional array is as 
multiple two -dimensional 
arrays (tables).  
2. The number of two -
dimensional tabl es required to 
represent three considerations  
is equal to the number of 
elemental cases  for the third 
consideration . 
3. The number of two -
dimensional tables required to 
represent four considerations  
is equal to the number of 
elemental cases  for the third 
consideration  multiplied by 
the number of elemental cases  
for the fourth consideration  
(and so on).

considerations , the 
practitioner is well -advised to 
reconsider the operational 
business decision by ana lyzing 
the following questions:  
 Can some portion(s) of the 
outcomes  be computed by

some formula(e)?  
 Can the operational 
business decision  be 
decomposed into 
subdecisions?  
 Is it really that important to 
manage the decision logic  in 
words ?  
 Is the selectivity in outcomes  
really worthwhile to the 
business?  
2. The multi -table thr eshold is 
one of three fundamental 
style -related thresholds in

or-column threshold . 
omission (in 
decision logic)  an anomaly  in 
decision logic  where 
some case in scope  is 
not addressed by any 
rule  1. An omission  is literally a 
missing rule, which in turn 
indicates decision logic  is not 
complete . See also

likely be applied only at a

A behavioral rule  in contra st 
generally should be applied at 
multiple points of

not apply only at a single point

the business rule  is meant to 
be enforced continuously – for 
example, if a student who is 
already active on some sports 
team should let his or her

restriction (for 
decision table)  a business rule  that 
directly governs the 
integrity (correctness) 
of a decision table   1. A restriction  acts as a 
limitation on how a decision 
table  may be pop ulated with 
decision rules . It pertain s to 
managing the decision table  
over time.  
2. Restrictions  often permit 
single -sourcing  within decision 
tables  and thus retention of 
business intent.

plus appropriate  
outcomes  – i.e., entire  
decision rules   1. The row-or-column -style 
always unites elemental cases  
in a series (i.e., effective ly 
concatenated) using either 
rows or columns.  
2. See also one-rule-per-
column  and one-rule-per-row 
(formats of decision table).  
3. The row-or-column -style  
might also be called the single -
axis style  since it always uses 
one or the other of the 
following – never both  –to 
display decision rules : 
 The vertical (y) axis to 
designate rows for decision 
rules . 
 The horizontal (x) axis to 
designate columns for 
decision rules.

subsumption 
(among individual

or disallow the same 
state, except that one 
business rule  requires 
or disallows the state 
for a superset of cases

decision tables  can result from 
either of the following:  
1. Simplification of the 
decision logic  for visualization, 
usually by a software tool. A 
decision t able  can be 
contracted (made smaller) by 
subsuming all possible decision 
rules .
