Decision Analysis: A Primer – How to Use DecisionSpeakTM and Question Charts (Q -ChartsTM) 
 
© 2013 Business Rule Solutions, LLC. www.BRSolutions.com . All rights reserved.   3 / 49 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  
Decision analysis  aims toward capturing and 
encoding the logic used to make decisions. 
These decisions are always operational 
business decisions  – not programmi ng, 
personal, strategic, or governance decisions. 
Operational business d ecisions are  common in 
business processes . Examples:  
• Should an insurance claim be accepted, 
rejected, or examined for fraud?  
• Which resource should be assigned to a 
task?  
• Which service should be used to ship a 
package?  
As these examples suggest, decision analysis 
involves identifying and analyzing key questions 
arising repetitively  in day -to-day business 
activity.  
The end -product  is the explicit decision logic  
used to  answer each questi on, which can take 
the form of  decision structure s, decision tables , 
and business rule  statements. This decision 
logic is rendered in a form that is practicable  
(ready for deployment whether to staff or 
ultimately to machines), enterprise -robust, and 
busin ess-friendly.  
Externalizing decision logic from processes 
reduces their complexity  significantly. It also 
results in decision logic that is far more 
accessible, adaptable (easier to change), and re -
usable (in other processes or for multiple use 
cases ). Ove rall, externalizing and single -sourcing 
decision logic is essential to achieving business 
agility.  This Primer focuses on top -down decision 
analysis and explains how to:  
• Analyze and define the key elements of 
operational business decisions.  
• Diagram operati onal business decisions and 
their dependencies.  
It introduces and explains:  
• Q-Charts ™, an effective brainstorming and 
diagramming technique for operational 
business decisions.  
• DecisionSpeak ™, a set of conventions for 
expressing the meaning of operational 
business decisions, especially the questions 
they address. Refer to Appendix 1 for a 
quick overview of what DecisionSpeak is.  
The natural follow -on activity after decision 
analysis is developing decision tables. For more, 
refer to the companion work, Decision Tables:  A 
Primer – How to Use TableSpeak ™1.  
We believe decision analysis should be a key 
concern in business analysis.  This discussion 
introduces business analysts to everything they 
need to know about this important discipline 
based on the BRS methodology, IPSpeak ®.

Decision Analysis: A Primer – How to Use DecisionSpeakTM and Question Charts (Q -ChartsTM) 
© 2013 Business Rule Solutions, LLC. www.BRSolutions.com . All rights reserved.   6 / 49 WHAT DECISION ANALYS IS IS 
Decision analysis  means  identifying and 
analyzing some key question in day -to-day 
business activity and capturing the decision 
logic used to answer the question. Examples of 
such questions:  
• Should this insurance claim be  accepted, 
rejected, or examined for fraud?  
• Which resource s hould be assigned to this 
task?  
• Which service should be used to ship this 
package?  
Typical kinds or patterns of decisions 
appropriate for decision analysis include 
classification, evaluation, selection, approval, 
assessment, assignment, allocation, diagnos is, 
and prediction.  
The end -product of decision analysis is decision 
logic  in the form of decision structures, decision 
tables , and business rule statements. This 
answer -oriented decision logic is rendered in a 
form that is:  
• practicable  
• enterpris e-robust  
• business -friendly  
A decision  is a determination requiring know -
how  or expertise; the resolving of a question by 
identifying some correct or optimal choice . A 
decision should represent the best or most 
appropriate  answer (outcome) among potential 
outcomes for some weighty (non -trivial) choice the business must make repetitively in day -to-
day business activity.  
Decisions appropriate for decision analysis are 
always operational business decisions  – not 
programming, pe rsonal, strategic, or 
governance decisions.  
To emphasize the point, this Primer  always says 
operational business decision , not simply 
decision . There is much confusion in the field on 
this point. The practitioner is urged to carefully 
review the important  target -problem 
clarifications presented in Appendix 2.  
Decision analysis can be undertaken in either of 
two ways:  
• Stand -alone:  Undertaken on its own for 
some specific decision(s).  
• Embedded:  Undertaken as part of another 
initiative – e.g., business process re -
engineering, web -based eCommerce, legacy 
system modernization, etc.  
Decision analysis should be a central focus of 
business analysis. Decision analysis is a highly 
effective, business -oriented means to capture 
certain kinds of business rules – principally , 
decision rules .  
By no means does decision analysis capture all 
business rules. Refer to Appendix 3 on the 
distinction between decision rules and other 
important kinds of business rules  you need to 
capture and manage.

BUSINESS DECISION S 
 
In DecisionSpeak the basic elements of 
operational business decisions  include those 
represented in Figure 1.  
A case  is some particular matter or situation  
requiring a n operational business decision. 
Example: John Smith  applies for auto insurance . 
Based on income, employment and experience, 
John  is a typical or ordinary  applicant.  
A potential outcome  is some result, conclusion, 
or answer that might be deemed appropriate 
for a case. Depending on the operational 
business decision , potential outcomes might  be 
any of the kinds listed in Table 1  on page 8. 
An operational business decision must always 
have at least two potential outcomes.  
Business analysts should a lways endeavor to be 
very clea r about potential outcomes . Shape and define them early; ma ke sure they are not hazy 
or fuzzy; r evisit and challenge  them often.  
An outcome  is the actual result, conclusion or 
answer from making a decision; that is, the  
result, conclusion or answer deemed 
appropriate for a given case . Example: John 
Smith , an ordinary  applicant in terms of income, 
employment, and experience,  is deemed 
eligible  for auto insurance ( but could have been 
deemed ineligible ). 
A decision rule  is a business rule  that guides 
the making of an operational busi ness decision; 
specifically, a business rule that links a case to 
some appropriate outcome. Example: The 
decision rule that links the case of an ordinary 
applicant like John Smith  to the outcome 
eligible .

The Basic Elements of Operational  
Business Decision s 
© 2013 Business Rule Solutions, LLC. www.BRSolutions.com . All rights reserved.   8 / 49 The decision logic  is the set of all decision rules 
for cases in scope  of a given operational 
business decision.  Decision logic should be 
represented declarative ly in the form of 
decision table(s) , business rule statement(s) , or 
some combination  thereof. Example of decision 
logic: All the business rules for whether an 
applicant is eligible for auto insurance.   
A decision task  is a task or action in which an 
operational business decision is made . The 
decision task  corresponding to auto insurance 
decision logic might be  Determi ne Eligibility of  
Applicant  for Auto I nsurance . Quite possibly this 
decision task is just one of many tasks in some  
business process . As Figure 1 illustrates, 
decision logic should be externalized from such 
decision task s. 
MORE ABOUT  DECISION TASKS  
Decision t asks,  like all tasks, are procedural . A 
decision task does something; specifically, it 
makes an operational business decision. 
Without some decision task, nothing happens – 
that is, no decision is made.  The decision logic, in contrast, should be purely 
declarative . It indicates only what the outcome 
for each possible case should  be; the decision 
logic cannot actually make the operational 
business decision. So there always has to be a 
task or action to make an operational business 
decision.  
For the purpose  of decision analysis, the need 
for a task or action to make a decision can be 
taken as a given . From this point forward, the 
discussion focuses exclusively on development 
of the relevant decision logic.  
Externalizing decision logic from decision tasks, 
a form of rule independence , produces simple 
(or thin) decision tasks, which in turn produces 
thin processes . It also results in decision logic 
that is far more accessible, adaptable (easier to 
change), and  re-usable (e.g., in other 
processes). Overall, we believe that  decision -
smart business processes  are the key to 
business agility.

The end -product of decision analysis  is decision 
structures , decision tables , and business rule  
statements – that is, decision logic  explicitly 
encoded using words . A goal is  to ensure the 
design logic can be understood and managed by 
business people and business analysts. The 
underlying assumption is that business people 
and business analysts will want to know why 
particular answers are reached.  
Decision analysis might also b e suitable where 
the end -products are  non-verbal – e.g., 
statistical models, neural nets, etc. – but these 
other forms are not covered in this discussion. 
In many respects the why is the hard part of the 
problem.  
We follow a set of conventions in decision 
analysis called DecisionSpeak .  
The first and perhaps most fundamental 
innovation in DecisionSpeak is how to properly 
ask the question that lies at the heart of an 
operational business decision . This question is 
so important for effective decision analysis  that 
DecisionSpeak recommends the question to be 
the one and only name  for the operational 
business decision.  
Naming an operational business decision 
according to the question it answers:  
• Provides a continuing checkpoint for testing 
what the operational b usiness decision is 
really about.  
• Serves as a constant reminder that the 
focus in decision analysis is on capturing 
declarative  decision logic, not on how work is performed from a procedural  point of 
view.  
• Assists in delineating scope. For example, 
the decision logic addressing the question Is 
an applicant eligible for insurance?  might 
not be about all kinds of insurance, perhaps 
just auto  insurance. If so, the question can 
be sharpened to Is an applicant el igible for 
auto  insurance?  
Forming, testing, and continually shaping the 
question that decision logic answers are a 
critical success factor for decision analysis. In 
practice, the challenge is seldom as simple as it 
might seem.  
BASIC DECISIONSPEAK CONVENTI ONS FOR 
EXPRESSING THE QUEST ION 
The question an operational business decision 
addresses should be expressed clearly in 
business language that is natural for business 
people. It should use business terminology, not 
field names for stored data or any other f orm of 
ITSpeak. Examples of well -formed questions:  
• Should an insurance claim be accepted, 
rejected, or examined for fraud?  
• Which resource should be assigned to a 
task?  
• Which service should be used to ship a 
package?  
We strongly recommend basing questions 
directly on a structured business vocabulary 
(concept model ). Avoid words that are 
Using DecisionSpeak to Ask Questions  
© 2013 Business Rule Solutions, LLC. www.BRSolutions.com . All rights reserved.   10 / 49 ambiguous or undefined. Example: Is the term 
service  clear and well -defined in the third 
question above?  
In formulating and phrasing the question, think 
of potential outcomes . The question and set of 
potential outcomes must  align. Example: 
Suppose the potential outcome umbrella  is 
suggested for the question What coat should be 
worn?  Something is amiss. Either the question is 
worded too narrowly or that potential outcome 
is inappropriate.  
DecisionSpeak offers the following additional 
guidelines for expressing the question 
addressed by some decision logic:  
• Avoid the word how . The interrogative how  
often suggests process or procedure. For 
example, a question worded as How  should 
an order be filled?  might be taken to mean 
What steps are appropriate in actually 
filling orders? . A better way to ask the 
question might be What method  should be 
used to fill an order? . 
 
Steering clear of any potential confusion 
with process or procedure is always best for 
decision analysis. Note that this convention 
does not apply to how much  or how many , 
both of which refer to some quantity rather 
than  to some action.  
• Avoid the word must  in favor of should . 
Example: Instead of What sales tax must  be 
charged on an order?, write What sales tax should  be charged on an order?.  
  
The answers provided by decision logic 
simply indicate appropriate outcomes for  
given cases. How strictly these outcomes 
are to be applied in actual business activity 
is a separate concern.  
• Avoid conversational  shortcuts  (e.g., I, we, 
you,  here, now, this, etc.). Examples:  
 
Instead of …  Write this instead …  
What coat should I 
wear today ? What coat should be 
worn?  
How should we 
price this order?  How should an order 
be priced?  
 
Using a conversational shortcut (also called 
discourse shortcut ) in a question can result 
in ambiguity, misunderstanding and misuse. 
The reason is simply that when the question 
is read out of context (i.e., apart from any 
conversation) the reference point for the 
shortcut is unclear.  
• Avoid and’s  and but’s . Operational business 
decisions with conjunctions are unlikely to 
be atomic. For example avoid: What is 
wrong with this machine and what 
approach should be used for fixing it?  The 
and indicates separate decisions, each of 
which should be analyzed in its own right.  
 
Decision Analysis: A Primer – How to Use DecisionSpeakTM and Question Charts (Q -ChartsTM) 
© 2013 Business Rule Solutions, LLC. www.BRSolutions.com . All rights reserved.   11 / 49 ANALYZING A DECISION : Q-COE 
In DecisionSpeak a Q-COETM is a graphic 
representation of an operational business 
decision  indicating what question (“Q”) is being 
asked, and usually one or more of the following: 
considerations  (“C”), outcomes  (“O”), and 
exceptions  (“E”).  Q-COEs often prove useful in 
facilitated sessions and other analysis work for 
brainstorming key elements of an operational 
business decision.  
In a Q -COE an elongated hexagon stands for an 
operational business decision. The question 
representing the operational business decis ion 
is indicated inside the hexagon. Figure 2 above 
illustrates a simple Q -COE.  
A Q-COE is an early step toward development of 
practicable  decision logic  (usually in the form of 
some decision table(s) ). For example, the Q -
COE in Figure 2 does not indicate : 
• specific outcomes for particular cases  
• any outcome for the exceptional case, 
Halloween .  A Q-COE simply offers some structure for 
brainstorming the key elements of a n 
operational business decision. Both Q -COEs and 
Q-Charts  should begin in ‘sketch’ mode. Too 
much ‘rigorous’ specification early -on will work 
against effective collaboration and dialog.  
CONSIDERATIONS  
In DecisionSpeak, a consideration is a factor in 
making an operational business decision; 
something that can be resolved to two or more 
cases . Such a factor always arises from the 
business side, not IT. In determining an 
applicant’s eligibility for auto insurance, for 
example, considerations might include driving 
history, evidence of insurance , insurance risk 
score,  credit rating, and state/province.   
In Figure 2 two considerations are shown:  
• rainy?  
• cold?

question marks, a question format is not 
required in practice. Use whatever form works 
best.  
Each of the two considerations in Figure 2 can 
be resolved to two or more cases  respectively:  
• Yes it is rainy, and no it is not rainy.  
• Yes it is cold , and no it is not cold . 
According to the Q -COE only these two 
considerations are needed (unless the specia l 
case Halloween applies) to answer the question, 
What coat should be worn? . Looking forward, 
you can imagine a decision table  being 
designed to represent combinations of cases 
and their appropriate outcomes2. Figure 3 
illustrates.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Refer to Appendix 4 for more about 
considerations and cases.  
EXCEPTIONS  
The outcome for any given case is usually 
determined by a standard or typical set of 
                                                           
2 Refer to the companion work, Decision Tables – A 
Primer: How to Use TableSpeak ™, by Ronald G. Ross , 
available (free) on 
http://www.brsolutions.com/IPSpeakPrimers  considerations.  If not, then the case is an 
exceptional case . An exceptional case 
(abbreviated exception  in a Q-COE) is a case in 
scope that does not use any of the 
considerations of a standard (normal) case . 
Each exceptional  case presumably uses  some 
other consideration (s). 
The Q -COE in Figure 2 indicates Halloween  as an 
exception. Consequently the ‘normal’ 
considerations cannot be used to determine an 
appropriate outcome for that case. What 
considerations or special decision rules  do 
apply is still to be determined.  
As another example suppose, as before, that in 
determining eligibility for auto insurance the 
standard considerations are: driving history, 
evidence of insurance , insurance risk score, 
credit rating, and state/province . Apart from 
those considerations, suppose any applicant 
must be denied auto insurance if either a felon  
or under 18 years of age . Since criminal status  
and age respectively are not among the 
standard or typical considerations for the 
decision logic, these cases are deemed 
exceptions . 
Exceptions can often be addressed by 
expressing some business rule(s) . The two 
exceptions above can be expressed by the 
following statement in RuleSpeak : 
An applicant for auto insurance must be  
considered ineligible if one or more of the 
follow ing are true:  
• The applicant has been convicted of a 
felony involving a motor vehic le. 
• The applicant is younger than 18 years 
of age.  What coat

Analyzing a Decision: Q -COE

scope. Definite outcomes are always given for 
exceptions, even if simply to deny (or accept) 
some result out -of-hand. Refer to Appendix 5 
for additional disc ussion.  
Cases that are not exceptional are considered 
standard . A standard case  is a case that is:  
• Regular or common,  
• Based on  some or all the usual 
considerations, and  • Subject to normal treatment and cannot be 
denied (or accepted)  out-of-hand . 
In DecisionSpeak typically at most 20% of all 
possible cases are exceptional. If the percentage 
of exceptional cases exceeds 20% for some 
decision logic, the standard or typical 
considerations should be re -examined.  
Identifying exceptional cases early -on can  
hugely simplify ‘normal’ decision logic  – and its 
eventual representation as decision tables as 
well.

A dependency between operational business 
decisions  occurs when one decision is logically a 
prerequisite for another.  DecisionSpeak  
recognizes three kinds of decision 
dependencies  as given in Table 2. Each kind of 
decision dependency is discussed individually 
below.  
Frequently asked questions  about this set of 
decision dependencies:  
Why aren’t mathematical  dependencies 
among the decision dependencies shown in 
Table 2?  
An example o f a mathematical dependency:  
A first  expression  (C - D = E) depends on a 
second  expression (A + B = C) in that the first 
expression depends on computation of C as 
prescribed by the second expression.  
Business rules for computation are best given by 
formul as featuring appropriate re -use of terms  
(e.g., ‘C’ in the two expressions above). 
Hierarchical visualization of mathematical dependencies between such expressions often 
does prove useful. To avoid confusion, however, 
Q-COEs  and Q-Charts  should not be used  for 
that purpose. Mathematical dependency is not 
what they are about.  
Must the two operational business decisions in 
a decision dependency have identical scope?  
No, but their scopes do need to align. Refer to 
Appendix 5 for discussion of scope for decisi on 
analysis; refer to Appendix 6 for specific 
discussion of alignment in decision 
dependencies.  A heads -up: Scope is an 
important and often non -trivial matter  in 
decision analysis (!). 
How are decision dependencies diagrammed?  
Decision dependencies are a ke y feature of Q -
Charts. Related Q -COEs are connected using 
vertical connectors. (Horizontal connectors 
might suggest process or flow. Since decision 
logic  under DecisionSpeak is always declarative , 
horizontal connectors are avoided.)  
Decision Dependencies  
© 2013 Business Rule Solutions, LLC. www.BRSolutions.com . All rights reserved.   15 / 49 Which operational business decision in a 
dependency connection is dependent on 
which?  
The decision on the top (the upper decision) is 
always dependent on the decision be low it. If a 
Q-Chart shows multiple levels of decision 
dependency (not unusual), the same is true 
pair-wise at each level below.  
As illustrated in the discussion that follows, 
every depiction of a dependency connection 
includes a  ‘hitch point’ (a solid cir cle) at  the 
bottom  end. The operational business decision 
on that end is always the one  most able to stand 
on its own – i.e., the lower decision is always 
the more  independent .  
RELEVANCE DEPENDENCY  
In relevance dependency , one operational 
business decisio n depend s on the outcome  of 
another operational business decision  such that 
the outcome of the other  decision may 
completely eliminate the need for any outcome 
from the dependent  (upper) decision .  
In other words, the dependent operational 
business decision can be  preempted  – indeed, 
made meaningless  in certain cases . 
In determining eligibility of applicants for auto 
insurance, for example, if an applicant is not 
eligible for coverage, there is no need  to 
determine what to charge the applicant as a 
premium. This relevance dependency between 
operational business decisions is illustrated in 
Figure 4 using a dashed connector (with hitch

the question area of th e Q-COE representing the 
dependent (upper) decision.   
 
Do processes always have to address the 
questions involved in a relevance dependency in 
bottom -to-top sequence? No, but caution 
should be exercised.  
For the questions in Figure 4, for example, a 
customer -friendly,  web -based application might 
permit price -conscious consumers to ask about 
the premium before  asking about eligibility.  
If supported, however, including some 
disclaimer would probably be appropriate to 
indicate that securing coverage at the given 
price is subject to eligibility. An explicit business 
rule should be written for that purpose. The 
business rule ensures a discla imer is given by 
any process or use case that supports a price -
before -eligibility sequence.

Decision Dependencies  
© 2013 Business Rule Solutions, LLC. www.BRSolutions.com . All rights reserved.   16 / 49 CONSIDERATION DEPENDENCY  
In consideration dependency , one operational 
business decision depend s on the outcome of 
another operational business decision  such that 
the outcome of the latter decision provides or 
supports one of the considerations  for the 
dependent  (upper) decision .  
In the coat problem, for example, it might not 
be possible to decide what coat to wear unless 
you decide whether it is cold. Deciding whether 
it is cold might have considerations all its own. 
This consideration dependency is illustrated in 
Figur e 5 above using a solid -line connector (with 
hitch point at bottom).   
The consideration cold?  in the dependent 
(upper) decision is conditional. Whether or not 
it is cold depends on the three considerations of 
the lower decision: temperature, wind  and 
humidity .  
If a consideration is not conditional in that 
sense (i.e., not based on other considerations), 
a consideration dependency is not needed. For 
example, suppose you can say Yes, it’s cold. or 
No, it’s not cold . without needing to know 
anything abou t the temperature, wind  and 
humidity . Then the lower decision Is it cold?  is 
not needed.

In outcome dependency , one operational 
business decision is  dependent on the outcome 
of another decision such that the outcome of 
this other  (lower) decision dictates  some 
outc ome(s) of the dependent (upper) decision. 
Two essential rules always apply to outcome 
dependencies:  
• Both decisions must have the same kind  of 
outcome.  
• The set of considerations of the less 
dependent (lower) decision must be the 
same as, or a subset of, the set of 
considerations of the more dependent 
(upper) decision. Refer to Appendix 7 for 
explanation.  
Figure 6 above  illustrates an outcome 
dependency using a dashed connector ( with 
hitch point at bottom).  The dashed line extends   
from the outcome area of the Q -COE for the 
dependent (upper) decision.   
Observations:   
• The lower (independent) Q -COE represents 
the question What set charges are th ere for 
shipping an order?  and has the outcome 
fixed shipping charge . 
• The upper (dependent) Q -COE represents 
the question What  should be charged for 
shipping an order?  and has the outcome 
shipping cost . 
• The structured business vocabulary  
(concept model , not shown) must indicate 
fixed shipping charge  and shipping cost  to 
be the same kind of thing.  
• The lower Q -COE uses the considerations 
zip code  and season, a proper subset of the

(dependent) Q -COE.  
• The net effect is that the lower Q -COE will 
dictate (“set”) some (but presumably not 
all) outcomes for the upper (dependent) Q -
COE. For example, if the zip code  is in 
Alaska, and the season  is winter, all shipping 
costs  might be $250, regardless of weight  or 
kind of package . This business rule  might be 
just one of many that dictate (“set”) 
shipping cost for multiple cases.  
RELEVANCE DEPENDENCY  VS. OUTCOME 
DEPENDENCY  
Relevance dependencies and outcome 
dependencies are alike in one important way – 
they both r epresent dependencies that can 
eliminate the need to ask the question for the 
upper (dependent) decision. Because of this 
similarity, a dashed line is used to represent 
both.  
Relevance dependencies and outcome 
dependencies are different, however, in the 
following fundamental way:  
• For relevance dependencies, the outcome 
from the lower (independent) decision 
makes any outcome from the upper 
(dependent) decision meaningless  in certain 
cases. In other words the upper (dependent) decision simply cannot 
produce any valid outcome for those cases.  
• For outcome dependencies, the outcome 
from the lower (independent) decision 
dictates  the outcome for the upper 
(dependent) decision in certain cases. That 
outcome is the only  one the upper 
(dependent) decision can produce for those 
cases.  
In DecisionSpeak, relevance dependencies and 
outcome dependencies are always 
distinguishable by the form  of the question 
specified for the lower (independent) decision. 
In other words, the qu estion is always worded 
distinctly.  
• A relevance dependency always asks a 
yes/no question (e.g., eligible/ineligible? ). 
• An outcome dependency always asks about 
a fixed  or set outcome (e.g., fixed shipping 
charge ). 
Finally, in Q -Chart notation the dashed line for a 
relevance dependency properly attaches to the 
question  area of the top Q -COE. The dashed line 
for an outcome dependency, in contrast, 
properly attaches to the outcome  area of the 
top Q -COE.

© 2013 Business Rule Solutions, LLC. www.BRSolutions.com . All rights reserved.   19 / 49 REPRESENTING A COMPL ETE DECISION STRUCTU RE: 
Q-CHART  
In DecisionSpeak a  Question Chart  (Q-Chart  for 
short) is  a graphic representation of two or 
more  operational business decisions  indicating 
how they are related (dependent) . A Q -Chart 
enables practitioners to capture, visualize, and 
analyze the structure ( decision structure ) of 
related operational business decisions in 
declarative  form.  
Q-Charts serve a very different purpose than 
business process models. Q -Charts comprise:  
 Q-COEs , which capture the basic 
elements of operational business 
decisions.  
 
 Decision dependencies , which show 
how Q -COEs relate  logically.  
 
Operational business decisions  often prove 
much more complex than they first seem(!). 
Developing a Q-Chart  is an important step 
before jumping with bo th feet into decision 
tables . Q-Charts also focus practitioners on 
scope, always a critical issue in business 
analysis. Refer to Appendix 5 for important 
discussion of defining scope for decision 
analysis under DecisionSpeak . 
Figure 7 on page 20 presents a more or less 
typical Q-Chart for discussion. Note the vertical 
arrangement of dependency connectors  and Q-
COEs. Since many notations for modeling 
process show flow or sequence horizontally, 
DecisionSpeak always orients Q -Charts 
vertically . Observations about the Q -Chart illustrated in 
Figure 7:   
• The highest Q-COE, representing the most 
dependent decision, represent s the 
question What should be charged for 
shipping an order? . Four considerations  are 
used in determining the outcome  shipping 
cost. 
• A consideration dependency  connects the 
top Q -COE with the Q -COE beneath it What 
method should be used to ship an order? . 
The outcome of the lower Q -COE provides 
the consideration kind of service  for the 
upper (more dependent) Q -COE.  
• The Q -COE What  method should be used to 
ship an order?  is connected via another 
consideration dependency  to the Q -COE 
beneath it What is the priority level of a 
customer? . The outcome of the lower Q -
COE provides the consideration priority level 
of customer  for the upper (more 
dependent) Q -COE.  
• The Q -COE What  method should be used to 
ship an order?  is also connected via a 
relevance dependency  to the Q -COE (lower 
left) Can an order be shipped? . If an order 
cannot be shipped, it is meaningless to ask 
How should an order be shipped? .

A proper Q-Chart  includes  only hexagons  (Q-
COEs ) each representing a distinct question. The 
Q-COEs implicitly indicate probable  links to 
external decision tables  (often not yet 
developed) .  
Other forms of depend ency diagrams may be 
used to show logical dependencies  between 
business rules  – i.e., where the expression of 
one business rule  references something 
computed or derived by another business rule. 
Two simple examples:  
• Mathematical dependency:  The expression 
of one business rule references age, which 
is computed by another (computation) 
business rule based on birthdate . 
• Derivation dependency:  The expression of 
one business rule references gold customer . Whether a customer is gold or not is 
derived (determined)  by another 
(derivation) business rule based on a doll ar 
threshold of orders shipped.  
An operational business decision may be based 
on both :  
• computation or derivation rules for certain 
well-defined cases . 
• subdecisions  for all other cases in scope.  
In such cases a mixed or hybrid  dependency 
diagram can prove extremely useful. Such a 
diagram can portray the fundamental structure 
of highly complex decision logic  in a single 
diagram. Refer to Appendix 8 for a complete, 
real-life example.

© 2013 Business Rule Solutions, LLC. www.BRSolutions.com . All rights reserved.   22 / 49 APPENDIX 1: WHAT DEC ISIONSPEAK IS  
DecisionSpeak  is a set of conventions for 
business -friendly representation of operational 
business decisions , diagramming decision 
structures , and expressing the ir meaning 
(semantics) in declarati ve fashion. Central to 
DecisionSpeak are:  
• Guidelines for expressing the questions that 
operatio nal business decisions address.  
• Q-COEs  and Q-Charts . 
DecisionSpeak optimizes for readability by non -
IT professionals and bus iness people.  
• Sequential dependencies  are removed in  
favor of logical dependencies.  • Business vocabu lary is always carefully 
used.  
No compromises are ever anticipated, however, 
in the accuracy and completeness of the 
decision rule(s)  with respect to the subject 
matter. There is never any hidd en or assumed 
interpretation semantics.  
DecisionSpeak is fundamentally based on words 
(semantics) and explicit rules. It is suitable for 
decision analysis  anytime you need to know 
why you get the results you get in words . See 
Appendix 2 for additional disc ussion.

© 2013 Business Rule Solutions, LLC. www.BRSolutions.com . All rights reserved.   23 / 49 APPENDIX 2: KINDS OF  DECISION APPROPRIATE  FOR 
DECISION ANALYSIS UN DER DECISIONSPEAK  
Decisions appropriate for decision analysis  
under DecisionSpeak  share five essential 
characteristics in common, collectively called 
‘DOORS’ : 
• Deterministic (always a definite best or 
optimal outcome).  
• Operational, rather than tactical or 
strategic.  
• Objective (encodable as explicit rules), 
rather than subjective.  
• Repetitive, rather than one -off or 
infrequent.  
• Single -point of determination, rather than 
multi -point.  
Will decision analysis enable  you to capture 
every relevant business rule ? No.  
Does every business rule fit into some decision 
table ? No.  
A great number  of business rules cannot be 
captured effectively using  decision analysis  or 
decision tables . Other techniques are still 
needed for capturing business rules (e.g., 
pattern questions ) and expressing business 
rules (e.g., RuleSpeak ). 
Decision analysis is  not appropriate for decisions 
that are:  
• Removed from day -to-day business activity 
or abstract. Examples: Are we following our 
business rules correctly? Is our business  process optimized or well -coordinated? Are 
we aligned with our business strategy?  Such 
questions pertain to governance. Decisions 
appropriate for decision analysis are always 
directly in -line to a business process  
(whether modeled or not).  
• Ones that can be resolved or predicted by a 
formula or calculation – i.e., by some 
equation(s). E xamples: How much is owed 
for an order? How much business has a 
customer done in the last 12 months? What 
is a student’s cumulative grade point 
average?  Decisions appropriate for decision 
analysis do not have outcomes  that can be 
calculated mathematically based on 
circumstances or cumulative history.  
SIMULATED VS. “FOR R EAL” DECISIONS  
A simulated decision  essentially asks what 
would be the outcome if a decision about a 
particular matter were made at a particular 
point in time.  
A simulated decision does not  decide the 
matter “for real”; it simply reveals what the 
results would have been if the decision had 
been made then. These results provide 
feedback that can then be used to improve 
results from the future “for real” decision . Tasks 
calling for simulated d ecisions are valid and 
valuable in business processes.  
Appendix 2: Kinds of Decision Appropriate for Decision Analysis under DecisionSpeak  
© 2013 Business Rule Solutions, LLC. www.BRSolutions.com . All rights reserved.   24 / 49 Examples:  
• Submitting a health insurance claim for a 
proposed procedure to determine what is 
covered and for how much rather than 
submitting the claim “for real”.  Result: A 
more informed decision about treatment of 
the pa tient can subsequently be made.  
• Submitting a request for a product part to 
ascertain current pricing and availability 
rather than submitting the request “for 
real”.  Result: An optimal decision about 
sourcing or repairing the part can 
subsequently be made.  
DecisionSpeak can be applied to analyze both 
simulated decisions and “for real” decisions. In 
all cases, however, meaningful analysis can be 
conducted only where the decision logic is 
under the business jurisdiction of the 
organization i tself. For example, it would 
probably not be meaningful for:  
• A health clinic to use DecisionSpeak to 
understand the decision  logic of an 
insurance company.  
• A manufacturing or engineering company to 
use DecisionSpeak to understand the 
decision logic  of an e xternal parts supplier.  
On the other hand, decision logic that must be 
interpreted from regulatory bodies and similar 
governing bodies  is under business jurisdiction. 
DecisionSpeak is quite useful in such 
circumstances.  
To continue, let’s assume some decis ion logic is 
under business jurisdiction of an organization. 
Especially important then is recognizing 
situations in which that decision logic is essentially the same for both a simulated and  
“for real” decision. Examples:  
1. An insurance company uses the same  
decision logic both to:  
• answer queries about coverage for 
particular treatments.  
• adjudicate actual claims.  
2. A manufacturing company uses the same 
decision logic to assess pricing and 
availability for parts both in:  
• composing bids for work.  
• conducting the actual work itself . 
In situations like these, decision analysis needs 
to be performed just once  since the same 
decision logic supports both decisions. 
Unification of the analysis saves significant 
resources and ensures consistency in the 
eventual decisions . 
Unification of the analysis, however, does not 
imply that the decision logic must remain 
completely static between every simulated and 
“for real” decision for any given case .  
Often feedback from a simulated decision can 
lead directly to insights about potential 
improvement in the decision logic before the 
subsequent “for -real” decision is made. Such 
adjustments are certainly possible and 
frequently desirable.  
For many business problems the volatility in the 
decision logic between simulated and “for real ” 
decisions for given cases can become quite high. 
At what threshold does DecisionSpeak cease to 
be useful?  
Appendix 2: Kinds of Decision Appropriate for Decision Analysis under DecisionSpeak  
© 2013 Business Rule Solutions, LLC. www.BRSolutions.com . All rights reserved.   25 / 49 The rule of thumb is as follows. DecisionSpeak is 
fundamentally based on words (semantics) and 
explicit rules. It will always remain applicable for  
decision analysis as long as you need to know 
why you get the results you get in words .  
Sometimes the path and pace of simulation and 
change -in-the-rules becomes quite rapid, 
experimental or personal.  
At the point you no longer need to trace and 
communi cate the ‘why’ in words , then statistics 
or other forms of non -verbal modeling will 
probably prove better suited to the problem.  
PERSONAL VS. ORGANIZ ATIONAL DECISIONS  
An important issue  for decision analysis  is: 
Whose decision is it?   
Suppose an  organizati on has the business rule : 
An employee must fly economy class on 
domestic flights while on company business . 
Any given employee can potentially decide to 
violate this business rule for any given domestic 
flight by booking a first -class or business -class 
ticket. (Likely though, t he business has some 
prescribed sanction waiting if it catches the 
violation – e.g., the employee must pay the 
difference in the fare) .  
As humans, employees  always have  a choice 
about whether to obey such business  rules. Because choi ce is involved,  there  is a decision. 
But it’s the employee’s personal  or individual  
decision, not an operational business decision .  
Business rules that involve personal choice, 
conformance, and potential sanction for 
violations are called behavioral rules . They are 
quite different from decision rules . Refer to 
Appendix 3 for additional discussion.  
Organizational decisions are of course often 
made by individuals.  
In decision analysis under DecisionSpeak, 
however, decision s are always organizational 
decisio ns, never personal decision s in the sense 
above . If some decision is made by an 
individual, the individual must be acting in a 
legitimate organizational capacity (role) and 
making the decision on the behalf of the 
organization.  
This issue touches on a frequent and often 
subtle source of confusion. Artificial intelligence 
(AI) generally tries to emulate intelligent 
behavior no matter what its source. 
DecisionSpeak in contrast addresses only 
organizational decisions.  
The latter pr oblem is hard enough, but it 
doesn’t begin to approach the difficulty of 
emulating the intelligent behavior of individuals . 
 
 
Decision Analysis: A Primer – How to Use DecisionSpeakTM and Question Charts (Q -ChartsTM) 
© 2013 Business Rule Solutions, LLC. www.BRSolutions.com . All rights reserved.   26 / 49 APPENDIX 3 : DECISION RULES VS. B EHAVIORAL RULES  
An operat ional business decision  focuses on 
determining the best or most appropriate 
answer to an operational business question.  
For a particular matter ( case ) the question 
generally needs to be answered only once (“for 
real”) at some particular point in time. 
Consequently, the relevant decision rules  are 
likely to be evaluated only at a single  point of 
determination .  
Example: Consider the operational business 
decision  What should be charged for shipping 
an order? . For any particular order all decision 
rules relevant to the decision might be 
evaluated only when that order is taken .  
Behavioral rules  in contrast:  
• Do not pertain  directly to determining the 
best or most appropriate answer ( outcome ) 
among alternatives. Instead, they are about 
guiding or shaping on -going busi ness 
activity – i.e., behavior.  
• Usually need to be applied at multiple  
points of determination  for the very same 
matter . Their purpose is to prevent 
undesirable situations that could occur at 
any of various  (multiple) points in time.  
These differences from decision rules are 
pronounced. Three simple (but typical) 
examples illustrate.  
1. Behavioral Rule: A customer that has 
ordered a product must have an assigned 
agent.  
 This business rule:  
• Is not about selecting the most appropriate 
agent for a customer – i.e., not about the 
decision, Who is the most appropriate agent 
for a customer?.  
• Does not apply only at a single point of 
determination – e.g., when an order is 
taken. 
Instead, the business rule is meant to be 
enforced continuously – for example even if the 
agent assigned to a customer retires or leaves 
the company.  
2. Behavioral Rule: A work group posted to a 
union site must include a union liaison.   
 
This business rule:  
• Is not about selecting the most  appropriate 
work group to post to a site – i.e., not about 
the decision, What work group should be 
posted to a union site? . 
• Does not apply only at a single point of 
determination – e.g., when a posting 
occurs.  
Instead, the business rule is meant to be 
enforced continuously – for example, if the 
current union liaison drops out of a work group, 
or if a non -union site to which a work group is 
posted subsequently becomes union.  
  
Appendix 3 : Decision Rules vs. Behavioral Rules  
© 2013 Business Rule Solutions, LLC. www.BRSolutions.com . All rights reserved.   27 / 49 3. Behavioral Rule: A student with a failing 
grade must not be an active member o f a 
sports team.  
This business rule:  
• Is not about selecting the most appropriate 
sports team for a student –i.e., not about 
the decision, Which sport team is best for a 
student?.  
• Does not apply only at a single point of 
determination – e.g., when a student  joins a 
team.  
Instead, the business rule is meant to be 
enforced continuously – for example, if a 
student who is already active on some sports 
team should let his or her grades fall.  
Business rules like the three in these examples 
generally fit no partic ular pattern. For that 
reason they cannot be effectively managed in a 
decision table  along with other parallel rules .  
Instead, they need to be expressed as individual 
business rule statements following appropriate conventions (e.g., RuleSpeak ). Your organ ization 
has hundreds or thousands of such business 
rules.  
Decision  rules and behavioral rules  are 
funda mentally different.  
• Decision  rules simply produce answers; 
behavioral rules indicate what you must or 
must not do.  (Behavioral rules always carry 
the s ense of obligation  or prohibition .) 
• Decision rules can usually be applied at a 
single point of determination; behavioral 
rules usually apply at multiple points of 
determination.  
These differences are stark. Many approaches 
gloss over them, or ignore them completely, 
causing great harm.  
Avoid force -fitting a decision -oriented approach 
to every business rule  problem. It simply does n’t 
work.

The relation of considerations  to cases is 
generally  class to instance . 
• A consideration is a kind of circumst ance  
that some decision logic  addresses . 
• A case is some  particular  circumstance(s) 
the decision logic addresses . 
For example, suppose state/province  is a 
consideration for an operational business 
decision . Then the particular instances Texas  
and British Columbia  are cases of that 
consideration.  As this example illustrates, a case can be as 
simple as a single instance for just one of the 
decision’s considerations. Such a case is very 
general . 
More oft en, cases addressed by a n operational 
business decision  represent combined instances 
of many or all of the decision’s considerations . 
Such a case is very specific .  
For example, the instances below might 
combine to represent one specific case  
addre ssed by an operational business decision .

ANALYSIS UNDER DECIS IONSPEAK  
Managing any project effectively requires 
clearly defined scope. Projects involving 
decision analysis  are no different in that regard.  
In decision analysis , scope is always ulti mately 
based on cases . Two fundamental 
DecisionSpeak  principles:  
1. The decision logic  produced from decision 
analysis must be able to give a definite 
outcome  for every case provably in scope.  
  
2. A case that is not in scope  must be handed 
off (to some expert, manager, process, or 
other decision logic).   
Definite outcome  (in the first principle) means a 
real business answer to the question being 
asked. An outcome such as unable to determine  
is not a real business answer. Any such case is 
not in scope and must be handed off.  
Two additional principles for decision analysis 
under DecisionSpeak:  
3. Scope must be specified explicitly . 
  
4. Scope is based on three essential elements:  
• The question the decision logic answers.  
• Limitations ab out the kinds of cases 
covered.  
• Exceptions . 
The first two elements in this last principle are 
highly intertwined.  For example, the question for some decision 
logic might be expressed in either of the 
following two ways:  
(a) Is an applicant eligible for auto  insurance?  
 
(b) Is an applicant eligible for insurance?  
Cases in Scope: auto  insurance  
The resulting scope is the same for either form 
of specification.  
Refinements to scope mean adding additional 
limitations that narrow the range of cases the 
decision logic handles (i.e., should give definite 
outcomes for).  
For example, the scope of the decision logic 
above might be further refined in either of the 
follo wing ways:  
(a) Is an applicant eligible for auto insurance 
for USA under $1 million ? 
 
(b) Is an applicant eligible for insurance?  
Cases in Scope:   
• auto insurance  
• USA 
• under $1 million  
Two more limitations, USA and under $1 million , 
have been added to each of the original 
expressions above.  
An implicit AND is understood to exist among all 
three scope items in each expression. (If there is 
any doubt about the intended ANDing, the 
Appendix 5 : Specification of Scope for Decision Analysis Under DecisionSpeak  
© 2013 Business Rule Solutions, LLC. www.BRSolutions.com . All rights reserved.   30 / 49 ANDing should be given explicitly.) As before, 
both fo rms of specification result in exactly the 
same scope.  
As scope is increasingly refined, listing 
limitations on scope separately (as in b) usually 
proves more effective, especially if the 
expressions are coordinated with a structured 
business vocabulary  (concept model ) – strongly 
recommended  in DecisionSpeak . For example:  
Question:  Is an applicant eligible?  
Cases in Scope: Any application submitted by an 
applicant that:  
• is for the product ‘auto insurance’  
• is for a policy covering the ‘USA’  
• requests a covera ge amount less than $1 
million  
To complete specification of scope for some 
decision logic, some business rule(s)  for 
handling exceptions must be given. For 
example:  
An applicant for auto insurance must be  
considered ineligible if one or more of the follow 
are true:  
• The applicant has been convicted of a felony 
involving a motor vehicle.  
• The applicant is younger than 18 years of 
age.  
SIMPLIFYING THE EXPRESSION OF DECISION  
LOGIC FOR STANDARD C ASES  
DecisionSpeak simplifies expression of decision 
logic for stan dard cases  in two important ways:  • By listing limitations for scope separately. 
(As discussed above, this can be 
accomplished either by including the 
limitations in the question representing the 
decision logic or by listing them apart from, 
but associated with, the question.)  
• By writing some business rule(s)  for the 
exceptional cases. Such business rules 
handle the special circumstances in which 
the exceptions apply.  
Specifying these two components separately 
allows them to be assumed  by any 
representation of the decision logic for standard 
cases – e.g., in decision tables . The two 
components do not need to be addressed again 
or built -into the decision tables.  
The resulting simplification produces slim 
decision logic. Since decision logic can be quite 
compl ex, such a priori simplification proves very 
helpful. Two additional points:  
• How the overall configuration of decision 
logic is implemented ‘under the covers’ 
should not be a concern. All components of 
the decision logic needed for correct 
evaluation of ca ses from a business poi nt of 
view have been addressed.  
• Wherever the decision logic is re -used, all 
the logic must be applied (deployed),  
including the separate specifications for 
scope items and exceptions. The decision 
logic for standard cases depends on the 
whole; re -use of just some subset can easily 
produce inappropriate or incorrect results.  
Appendix 5 : Specification of Scope for Decision Analysis Under DecisionSpeak  
© 2013 Business Rule Solutions, LLC. www.BRSolutions.com . All rights reserved.   31 / 49 SIMPLIFYING THE ANALYSIS OF DECISION  
LOGIC FOR STANDARD CASES  
A key to simplifying the analysis of decision logic 
for standard cases is to divide and conquer . 
Projects should be carved out that can be 
undertaken separately and, if resources permit, 
in parallel. DecisionSpeak supports this.  
Example:  Suppose the considerations used to 
determine eligibility for auto insurance in the 
USA for well-heeled applicants  differ from those 
for ordinary  applicants  in terms of income, 
employment, and experience .  
The decision logic for the two kinds (subsets) of 
cases in this example can be developed 
separately if both the following are true:  
• The two subsets of cases are non -
overlapping. (Otherwise, some cases could 
be decided by either decision logic, 
resulting in pot entially inconsistent results.)  
• The two sets o f considerations are not 
exactly the same. (If the same, there is no 
particular advantage in treating the cases 
separately.)  
The divide -and-conquer strategy leads to 
independent subdecision s.  
In DecisionSpeak, an  independent subdecision  
is one of a collec tion of two or more operational 
business decisions on which another operational 
business decision is dependent via consideration 
dependencies . Each subdecision  has a distinct 
outcome and a different set of considerations 
(usually non -overlapping) from its peers in the 
collection.  Example 1. The launching of a rocket.  
Before the ultimate operational business 
decision Should the rocket be  launch ed? is 
addressed, an entire checklist of subdecisions is 
addressed, each with its own outcome and set 
of considerations. These subdecisions pertain to 
weather, fuel systems, communications, down -
field recovery, etc.  
At first glance, the outcome for each 
subdecision might se em the same as for the 
other subdecisions – launch is currently 
acceptable/unacceptable . That common first -
cut impression is inaccurate. Each outcome is 
actually selective  and distinct:  
• launch is currently acceptable/unacceptable 
given the weather conditio ns 
• launch is currently acceptable/unacceptable 
given the fuel status  
• launch is currently acceptable/unacceptable 
given down -field recovery readiness  
• etc. 
Example 2. Is an applicant eligible for auto 
insurance for USA under $1 million?   
Independent subdecis ions might be :  
• Is the applicant’s driving history acceptable?  
• Has the applicant given acceptable evidence 
of insurance?  
• Is the applicant’s Insurance Risk Score O.K.?  
• etc. 
Each of these subdecisions would have a 
distinct outcome and probably a non -

DEPENDENCIES  
DecisionSpeak  principles for scope in decision 
dependencies  between operational business 
decisions  are the following:  
1. Every operational business decision has a 
given scope.  (Refer to Appendix 5 fo r 
discussion.)  
 
2. The means of expressing scope for an 
operational business decision is immaterial.  
 
It should make no difference whether 
specification of scope for an operational 
business decision is:  
• externalized – i.e., defined as some 
scope item(s) and/ or included in the 
question the operati onal business 
decision answers.  
• internalized – i.e., defined as 
considerations  and cases .  
For verification purposes, the result is the 
same  either way.  
3. The scope of an operational business 
decision is limited only by  what is stated 
explicitly.  
 
An operational business decision is assumed 
to cover all cases based on terms and 
wordings (for verb concepts) the 
operational business decision does not 
reference.  
In other words, the scope of an operational 
business decision is limited only by what is stated explicitly . (Terms and wordings come 
from a structured business vocabulary  – a 
concept model .) 
4. In any given decision dependency, the scope 
for the top operational business decision 
and the scope for bottom decision can be 
different.  
 
5. In any decision dependency  where the 
scope s for the operational business 
decision s are different , the scope of t he top 
(more dependent) operational business 
decision must al ign with the scope of the 
bottom (less dependent) decisio n.  
 
Specifically, given each term or fact in the 
structured business vocabulary (concept 
model), the scope of the bottom decision 
must be broader  than (or the same as) the 
top decision in the decisi on dependency.  
MISALIGNMENT OF SCOP E 
Misalignment of scope in decision 
dependencies can arise in the ways discussed 
below. For simplicity this discussion considers 
only pairs of operational business decisions. A 
top decision having multiple bottom decision s is 
examined later.  
Exclusion. Suppose the decisions in a decision 
dependency both use the consideration  person . 
Furthermore:  
• The scope of the top decision is specified to 
be the person called Henrietta . 
Appendix 6:  Alignment of Scope in Decision Dependencies  
© 2013 Business Rule Solutions, LLC. www.BRSolutions.com . All rights reserved.   34 / 49 • The scope of the bottom decision is 
specified as not Henrietta .  
Clearly, the scopes of these decisions are not 
aligned; the cases  they consider with respect to 
person  are disjoint. The bottom decision should 
therefore not be used as a basis for the top 
decision. Reasoning in that fashion is simply 
unjustified (logically wrong).  
Generality. Suppose the decisions in a decision 
dependency again use the consideration perso n. 
Furthermore:  
• The scope of the top decision specifies 
person . 
• The scope of the bottom decision is 
specified as only the person  called 
Henrietta .  
The scopes of these decisions are poorly 
aligned; the cases considered by the top 
decision  are far more gene ral than the (single) 
case considered by the bottom decision. 
Reasoning over these operational business 
decisions would essentially be inductive . 
Inductive reasoning is not addressed by the 
end-products of decision analysis under 
DecisionSpeak.  
Omission. In a given decision dependency 
suppose:  
• The bottom decision mentions person or a 
specific person , say Henrietta . 
• The top decision does not mention person  
at all.  
The result is that the scope of the bottom 
decision is narrower than that of the top 
decision . Reasoning over these operational business decisions would again be 
inappropriate; such reasoning runs from more 
narrow to more general.  
Note the reverse situation, reasoning from more 
general to more narrow, is acceptable.  
For example suppose the top decision mentions 
person or a specific person , say Henrietta , but 
the bottom decision does not mention person  at 
all. The result is that the scope of the top 
decision is narrower than that of the bottom 
decision. Reasoning over these operational 
business decisions is therefore appropriate.  
MULTIPLE BOTTOM OPER ATIONAL 
BUSINESS DECISIONS  
A given top operational business decision may 
participate in multiple decision dependencies; 
that is, it might have multiple bottom decisions.  
In that circumstance, any given bottom decision 
might not satisfy the fifth principle above, but 
taken jointly with one or more other bottom 
decisions, it might.  
For example, suppose the top operational 
business decision uses the consideration 
person . One b ottom decision specifies male 
person ; another bottom decision specifies 
female person .  
If no other scope factors contravene, the 
collective scope of the bottom decisions is the 
same as the scope of the top decision; therefore 
the fifth principle is satisf ied.

© 2013 Business Rule Solutions, LLC. www.BRSolutions.com . All rights reserved.   35 / 49 APPENDIX 7: ABOUT CO NSIDERATIONS IN OUTC OME 
DEPENDENCIES  
Two rules always apply to outcome 
dependencies in DecisionSpeak:  
1. Both operational business decisions mus t 
have the same kind of outcome.  
 
2. The set of considerations of the less 
dependent (lower) decision must be the 
same as, or a subset of, the set of 
considerations of the more dependent 
(upper) decision.  
Why is the second rule appropriate?  
• If the less dep endent (lower) operational 
business decision had all the considerations 
of the dependent (upper) operational 
business decision, the less dependent 
(lower) decision would obviate the need for 
the dependent (upper) decision.  
 
In other words, the less depend ent (lower) 
decision would cover and dictate the 
outcome of every case covered by the 
dependent (upper) decision.  • If the less dependent (lower) operational 
business decision had none of the 
considerations of the dependent (upper) 
operational business deci sion, the less 
dependent (lower) decision would be 
toothless (without any effect) and therefore 
inappropriate.  
 
In other words, the less dependent (lower) 
decision would not cover any case covered 
by the dependent (upper) decision.  
• If the less dependent (lower) operational 
business decision had one or more 
considerations in addition to a proper 
subset of the considerations of the 
dependent (upper) operational business 
decision, the less dependent (lower) 
decision could produce multiple outcomes 
for indivi dual cases addressed by the 
dependent (upper) decision.  
 
Multiple outcomes without discrimination 
almost surely would not have been 
intended.

© 2013 Business Rule Solutions, LLC. www.BRSolutions.com . All rights reserved.   36 / 49 APPENDIX 8: EXAMPLE  OF A HYBRID DEPENDEN CY 
DIAGRAM  
A hybrid dependency diagram  includes  a mix of 
individual decision rules  (represented by boxes) 
and subdecisions  (shown as Q-COEs ), all based 
on a single (complex) question ( operational 
business decision ).  
The goal is to represent the associated decision 
logic  in a unified, highly approachable form and 
to provide a visual aid to help readers absorb 
know -how  that is intrinsically complex.  
In Figure 9 on page 37 the operational business 
decision (at the top) asks  What is the best 
antigen series for the patient?   
Immediately beneath the question is a ‘stub’ for 
a derivation rule, An antigen series i s the best 
patient series if …  . 
• On the left side of the diagram are four 
boxes indicating cases  in which the correct 
or optimal answer can be determined 
directly (i.e., without reference to decision 
tables ).  
 
The text in each box simply completes the 
rule ‘stub’. See additional discussion 
following the diagram.  
• On the right side of the diagram are three 
cases in which the correct or optimal 
answer cannot be determined directly – so 
the answer is based on subdecisions.  
 
These subdecisions (and the associ ated 
decision tables – not shown) determine the ‘winner’ based on the highest number of 
points scored.  
At the bottom of the diagram is a derivation rule 
given  in RuleSpeak that provides the meaning 
for the special vocabulary wins on points . 
The four boxes on the left side of the diagram 
can be viewed as either representing four 
individual business rules, or better , as a single 
business rule . Using RuleSpeak  tabulation3 the 
unified business rule could be expressed as : 
An antigen series must be considered the  best 
patient series if any of the following is true:  
• Only one antigen exists for that antigen 
series.  
• Exactly one antigen series is completed for 
the patient.  
• Exactly one antigen series is in -process for 
the patient, and no antigen series is 
completed for  the patient.  
• All the antigen series given to the patient do 
not have any valid dose, and the antigen 
series is the default for the antigen.  
Specification of this business rule separately 
from the diagram, however, is not necessary – 
the lef t side of the diagram is already 
practicable  as shown.

concept model , and 
developing a structured 
business vocabulary   1. Refer to Decision Analysis: A 
Primer – How to Use 
DecisionSpeak ™ and Question 
Charts (Q -Charts ™), available 
(free) 2013 on 
www.BRSolutions.com .  
2. Central to DecisionSpeak  is 
expressing the questions that 
operational business decisions  
address.  
3. Q-COEs  and Q-Charts  are par t 
of DecisionSpeak . 
4. DecisionSpeak  optimizes for 
readability by non -IT 
professionals and business 
people.  
 Sequential dependencies are 
removed in favor of logical 
dependencies.  
 Structured business 
vocabulary  is always carefully 
used.  
No compromises are made, 
however, in the accuracy and 
completeness of the decision 
rule(s)  with respect to  the subject 
matter. There is never any  hidden 
or assumed interpretation 
semantics.  
5. DecisionSpeak  is 
fundamentally based on words 
(semantics) and e xplicit rules . It is 
suitable  for decision analysis  
anytime  you need to know why 
you get the results you get in 
words . 
6. DecisionSpeak  is part of  
IPSpeak . 
7. The natural follow -on to 
DecisionSpeak  is TableSpeak , 
with which DecisionSpeak  is 
closely aligned.   
decision 
structure  how one or more 
operational business 
decisions  are formally 
organized   1. A decision structure  should 
indicate operational business 
decisions  that are dependent – 
i.e., consideration -dependent, 
relevance -dependent, and/or 
outcome -dependent.  
2. A Q-Chart  visually organizes a 
decision structure .  
decision table  a structured means of 
visualizing decision rules  
in rows and columns   A decision table  identifies the 
appropriate outcome  for each 
case it covers.   
decision task  a task centered on 
making an operational A. Determine 
clothes to wear  1. As recommended for all tasks, 
a decision task  should be named

business decision  – that 
is on deciding something 
rather than on doing 
something  B. Determine sales 
tax on purchases  using a verb + noun (or noun 
phrase).  
2. A decision task  always involves 
a determination of some kind – 
hence, DecisionSpeak  
recommend s using the 
convention “ Determine  …” to 
name a decision task . 
3. A decision task  often appears 
in a business process model (b ut 
does not have to).  
declarative  constituting a n 
expression or 
representation  that can 
be either true or false   1. There is no implicit meaning 
(semantics) in declarative  
expressions or representations.  
2. Contrast to procedural . 
3. In graduate school in the early 
1970s (the days of punch cards) I 
learned a highly pragmatic test 
for determining whether 
specifications are declarative : 
 Take each statement of the 
specifications and type it on an 
individual punch card.  
 Assemble the deck.   
 Test it to make sure it works.  
 Throw the whole deck up in the 
air.  
 Pick up all the cards in random 
order.  
 Re-test it.  
If the logic still works, the 
statements are declarative .  If 
not, they are procedural .  The 
point is that in declarative  
specifications no logic is lost 
‘between the lines’ – i.e., none is 
intrinsic to the sequence of 
presentation.  In other words, 
there is no hidden meaning 
(semantics).  2: constituting a 
statement that can 
be either true or 
false  
exception  see exceptional case     
exceptional case  a case in scope  that does 
not use the 
considerations  of a 
standard case ; i.e.,  a 
case in scope  that is 
based on some 
consideration(s)  that 
is/are not among the 
considerations  for a 
standard case  A. Halloween  
B. Food  
C. Auto insurance:  
 An applicant is 
convicted of a 
felony involving a 
motor vehicle.  
 An applicant for 
auto insurance is 
not 18 years of 
age or older.  
 The applicant is 
the boss’s 
daughter.  1. Special decision logic  must be 
developed for each exceptional 
case . 
2. The decision logic  for an 
exceptional case  might be as 
simple as a single decision rule  
(e.g., The boss’s daughter must 
be accepted for auto insurance. ), 
or significantly more complex.  [exception] 2: one 
that is excepted or 
taken out from 
others  
 
[except - transitive 
verb] 1: to take or 
leave out 
(something) from a 
number or a whole :

point of 
determination  a point in operational 
business activity where 
one or more business 
rules  are evaluated or 
applied in a particular 
matter   All the decision rules  for an 
operational business decision  
(e.g., What should be charged  for 
shipping an order? ) would likely 
be applied only at a single point 
of determination  (e.g., when an 
order is taken). A behavioral rule  
in contrast generally should be 
applied at multiple points of 
determination . Consider the 
behav ioral rule  A student with a 
failing grade must not be an 
active member of a sports team.  
This business rule  does not  apply 
only at a single point of 
determination  (e.g., when a 
student joins a team). Instead, 
the business rule  is meant to be 
enforced conti nuously – for 
example, if a student who is 
already active on some sports 
team should let his or her grades 
fall.

outcome  some result, conclusion,
