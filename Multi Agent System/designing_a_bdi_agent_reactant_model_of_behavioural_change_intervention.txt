 Abstract  
 
Belief -Desire -Intention (BDI) model is well suited for describing agent’s mental state. The BDI of an 
agent represents its motivational stance and are the main determinant of agent’s actions. 
Therefore, explicit understanding of the representation and mode lling of such motivational stance 
plays a central role in designing BDI agent with successful behavioural change interventions. 
Nevertheless, existing BDI agent models do not represent agent’s behavioural factors explicitly. 
This leads to a gap between des ign and implementation where psychological reactance has 
being identified as the cause of BDI agent behavioural change interventions failure. Hence, this 
paper presents a generic representation of BDI agent model based on behavioural change and 
psychologic al theories. Also, using mathematical analysis the model was evaluated. The objective 
of the proposed BDI agent model is to bridge the gap between agent design and 
implementation for successful agent -based interventions. The model will be realized in an ag ent-
based application that motivates children towards oral hygiene. The study explicitly depicts how 
agent’s behavioural factors interact to enhance behaviour change which will assist agent -based 
intervention designers to be able to design intervention tha t will be void of reactance.

 1.0  INTRODUCTION  
 
Research in Belief Desire Intention  (BDI)  agents that 
are capable of rational behaviour has received a 
great deal of attention from multi -agent research 
community in recent years. This is due to many 
reasons, but perhaps the most compelling is the fact 
that BDI model comprises of philosophical mo del of 
human practical interaction and reasoning. Although 
some studies have explored BDI agent model for 
exam ples in [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6] and [7 ]. In the 
study  by [1], a planning theory of intention was 
proposed  where agent intentions are treated as 
elements of partial plans of action. The plans play 
basic roles in practical reasoning; roles that support 
agent decision activities over time and social 
communication.   
However, none of these studies explicitly depicts 
agent mental state in behavioural  change 
intervention activities. Also, these BDI models do not 
explicitly describe mechanisms for the agent factors 
to interact between each other in order to achieve 
behaviour change. Therefore, this article  presents a 
BDI agent model of behaviour change that analyse 
agent’s factors and deflect psychological reactance 
in agent -based application intervention.  This article is 
structured as follows. After an introduction of the 
area of BDI and its underlying concepts , first the 
dynamical model for reactant in  behaviour change  
by means of simulation . Next, the main concepts of 
this model are specified, and results from simulation 
experiments are discussed and verified. Finally, a 
discussion concludes this article . 
 
 
2.0  THE UNDERLYING CONCEPTS OF BDI 
AGENT MOD EL  
 
The BDI model is closely associated with intelligent 
agents. However the BDI agent does not possess 
some characteristics associated with intelligent 
agents. For example, it allows agents to have private 
beliefs, but does not force them to be private  and 
not only to cover agent communication  [8], [9]. 
Consequently, the BDI software model is an attempt 
to solve a problem that has more to do with plans 
and planning (the choice and execution thereof) 
than it has to do with the explicit understanding of 
mechanism that leads to agent action and plans. 
Thus, in behaviour change intervention, BDI agent 
focus more on agent plans and planning factors in 
achieving their target interventions.  Figure 1 depicts 
the overall functioning of the BDI model  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 In order to explicitly understand how agent c an 
achieve successful behaviour  change intervention, 
explorations were made on psychological theories of 
behaviour change and psychological reactance.  
Thus, BDI model is an integrated model based on the 
following psychological  theories and model s namely 
Relapse Prevention Model (RPM), Trans -Theoretical 
Model (TM), Self -Efficacy Theory (SET), Self -Regulation 
Theory (SRT), Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA), Theor y 
of Planned Behaviour (TPB) and Health Belief Model 
(HBM). These existing psychological  theories  and 
models  were divided into two main groups namely: 
Social Cogn ition Models and Stage Models [10 ]. 
 
2.1  Social  Cognition Models (SCM s) 
 
Social Cognition Models are set of similar theories 
which show the imperative of cognition and their 
inter -relationship in the regulation of behaviour [11]. 
These theories (Self -Efficacy Theory, Self -Regulation 
Theory, Theory of Reasoned Action and Planned  
Behaviour and Health Belief Model) that made up 
the Social Cognition Model only explicate major 
factors that affect behaviour change [10]. SCM s are 
used to identify and explain how expectations, 
judgments, beliefs, and intentions lead to the 
performance o f various behaviours [12].    
Despite the widespread use in behaviour change 
interventions, the SCM s have  been criticized by many 
researchers. For instance, in study [13 ] criticized the 
models to have omitted some major factors in 
behaviour changes. Furthermore , in [14] has pointed 
out there is an overlap of factors between the 
different theories.  
 
2.1.1  Self -Efficacy Theory (SET)  
 
Self-Efficacy  is the appraisal of one's self ability and 
capability to complete tasks and reach pre -defined 
objectives and goals. Individual's knowledge 
acquisition might be directly related to observation s 
of others within the context of social interactions and 
experiences. There are three main  events related to 
the self -efficacy traits, namely; 1) one’s ability to 
control the resultant behaviour, 2) perceived control 
over external barrier , and 3) having confident in 
one’s own ability to perform the actions that might 
lead to the change  [15].  
This implies that for behavioural change to occur  
there i s need for a strong inter -self-motivation (self -

 efficacy) to perform the action that might lead to 
the change. In many cases , this motivation is built as 
a result of social interaction with others  [16]. In 
addition, it also can be argued that  some  of the  
behaviour s can be resulted from  the emotional  
responses determined largely by personality, 
behavioural nature and social factors, which are 
controlled heavily by evolution, and has little to do 
with motivation or observation  [17]. For instance, 
jealousy can  drive one to behave in a way that is not 
consistent with one's normal behaviour and some 
personality, social and behavioural nature factors 
were not considered in this theory.  
 
2.1.2  Self -Regulation Theory (SRT)  
 
Self-regulation theory suggests  that for  an 
intervention to result to behaviour change, the user 
should experience some level of decline in the effect 
of self -determination, self -discipline and self -control  
[18]. It explains that we expend effort in control of 
what we think, say, do and trying t o be the person 
we want to be, both in particular situations and in the 
longer -term  [19].  
Therefore, self -regulation is a mechanism to 
prevent us from doing things we know we should not 
do. For instance , caution on saying impolitely words 
to other people. Self -regulation can be applied in 
creating positive behaviours, such as studying for 
exams. The theory is individualistic based and does 
not consider social norms and environmental factors. 
However  it explores more of inner motivation or ability 
that leads to behaviour change than external 
motivation. While in the real world, it takes both inter 
and external factors to lead to behaviour change 
[20]. 
 
2.1.3  The Theory of Reasoned Action and the Theory 
of Planned Behaviour (TRA & TPB)  
 
The Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) is used to 
initialize conditions under which attitude as a 
precursor to  predict behaviour [21]. The primary 
components of TRA are ; behavioural intention, 
attitude, and subjective norm. TRA suggest s that a 
person's behavioural intention depends on the 
person's attitude about the behaviour , and 
subjective norms. This brought in context that a 
person's volitional (voluntary) behaviour is predicted 
by his or her attitude toward s that behaviour a nd 
how he  or she thinks  other people would view them if 
they  performed the behaviour [22].  
A person's attitude, combined with subjective 
norms, forms this behavioural intention.  If they  intend 
they will do it [23]. Behavioural intention measures a 
person's relative strength of intention to perform the 
behaviour. Attitude consists of beliefs about the 
consequences of performing the behaviour 
multiplied by his or her evaluation of these 
consequences. Subjective norm is seen as a 
combination of perceived expectations from relevant individuals or groups along with intentions to 
comply with these expectations [24].  
This theory depict s that environmental, 
demographical factors do not directly influence the 
likelihood of a person performing behaviour; these 
were regarded as peripheral factors yet it has been 
observed that these peripheral aspects are very 
significant factor as to whether behaviour change 
shall occur. But this was later improved on by the 
theory of planned behaviour; which gives a better 
and refined understanding about attitude and 
behaviour.  
Theory of Planned Behaviour was designed out of 
a counter -argument against the high relationship 
between behavioural intention and actual 
behaviour, as the results of s ome studies shown that 
behavioural intention does not always lead to actual 
behaviour because of circumstantial limitations [25]. 
Since behavioural intention cannot be the exclusive 
determinant of behaviour where an individual's 
control over the behaviour is incomplete [26]; Ajzen 
introduced the Theory of Planned Behaviour by 
adding a new factor known as perceived 
behavioural control [27].  
By this, he extended the theory of reasoned 
action to cover non -volitional behaviours for 
predicting behavioural inten tion and actual 
behaviour. This concept has been widely use in 
persuasion and behavioural prediction in many 
domains like marketing, media, communication, 
computer science and other. However, the theory of 
planned behaviour overlooks emotional variables 
such as threat, fear, mood and negative or positive 
feeling and assessed them in a limited fashion.  
 
2.1.4  The Health Belief Model (HBM)  
 
The Health belief model consist of perceived 
susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits, 
perceived barriers, perceived motivation and 
perc eived cue as shown  [10]. Perceived susceptibility 
means vulnerability of the audience’s perceived risk 
of performing the behaviour. Perceived severity 
connotes the seriousness of the action and its 
consequence s as per ceived by the audience.  
In contrast to perceived risk, the p erceived 
benefits refer to the perceived advantages of the 
alternative course of action including the extent to 
which it reduces the risk of the behaviour or the 
severity of its consequences. Perc eived barriers (or 
perceived costs) refer to the perceived 
disadvantages of adopting the recommended 
behaviour as well as perceived obstacles that may 
prevent or hinder successful performance of the 
behaviour. Perceived motivation is the enabling 
ability t o perform the behaviour while Perceived Cue 
is a trigger factor that enables the other five 
concepts to result into behaviour change. Although 
this model provides a framework to explain and 
predict behaviour change of individuals, it does not 
incorporate s ocial influence, personality and 
environment factors [28].

 2.1.5  Fogg Behaviour Model (FBM)  
 
The model  was proposed by study [29 ] and it 
illustrates  three factors essential for behaviour 
change to occur . These factors are: 1) motivation, 2) 
ability , and 3) triggers . For the target behaviour to 
occur, a person must have sufficient motivation, 
enabling ability, and an effective trigger. All three 
factors must be present at the same instant for the 
behaviour to occur.  
The model had been used in many  motivati onal 
and persuasive system designs. For instance, in study 
[30], the researchers incorporated  the Fogg 
behaviour model to design a micro -blogging site 
called Twitter Me. The site was integrated with phone 
application s via social media, aims  to motivate 
teenage girls towards exercises.. In another study [31] 
implemented  the Fogg behaviour model to design a 
social tagging system application known as 
Tagliatelle , to support  healthier eating habits  for 
weight reduction programmes.  
 
2.2  Stage Models  
 
These are set of theories that are based on 
segmentation approach of behavioural change 
factors. It defined movement of factors through a 
pattern of distinct stages over time and these stages 
can be explained only based on their distinguishing 
characterist ics [32]. In particular, stage models in 
cognitive development have layers of succession 
which are grouped into two distinct stages namely 
output and initial stages. The output stage (later 
stages) integrates the achievements of initial stage 
(earlier stag es). And each has well defined mental 
processes which are meant for them which might be 
dependent on time frame  
 
2.2.1  The Relapse Prevention Model (RPM)  
 
Relapse is an outcome of behaviour that can be 
negative in terms of behaviour change processes. An 
initial setback, or lapse, may either translate into a 
return to the previous problematic behaviour, known 
as relapse, or into the individual turning again 
towards positive change, called prolapsed 
depending on the situation [33]. Study [3 4] argued 
that relapse is multi -determined, especially by self -
efficacy, outcome expectancies, craving, 
motivation, coping, emotional states, and 
interperson al factors . In particular, high self -efficacy, 
negative outcome expectancies, potent availability 
of coping skills following persuasion, positive effect, 
and functional social support are expected to 
predict positive outcome.  
This theory is classified as stage model because of 
it stage -wise structural explanation of behaviour 
change factors. Although the  model is widely used in 
drug related health behaviour change interventions but the primary limiting factor is that in humans, 
relapse rarely follows the strict extinction of drug -
seeking behaviour. It is mainly based on drug -related 
case which cannot be g eneralized. Additionally, 
human self -reports show that drug -associated stimuli 
play a lesser role in craving in humans than in the 
laboratory models [35]. 
 
2.2.2  The Trans -Theoretical Model (TM)  
 
The theory of Trans -Theoretical Model is one of the 
successful ones that have been applied to many 
behaviour changes interventions. It involves 
transitions between the stages of behaviour change 
as affected by a set of factors known as the 
processes of change. These include decisional 
balance (the pros and cons of change), self -efficacy 
(confidence in the ability to change across problem 
situations), and situational temptations to engage in 
the problem behaviour, and behaviours which are 
specific to the problem area [36]. Study [3 7] 
summarized  the model  into five stage of behaviour 
change name; pre - contemplation, contemplation, 
preparation, action, and maintenance.  
In addition, study done by [38] suggested that 
progress on these stages depend on awareness, 
motivation and commitment of the audience. Pre -
cont emplation is the stage where the audience is 
unaware of the need to change the behaviour (not 
aware of the benefits of changing his behaviour). 
Contemplation is the stage that the audience has 
gain awareness about the benefits or gains due if the 
behaviour  is change. Preparation is the stage of 
building internal motivation and strength to perform 
the behaviour. Action stage is when behaviour 
change had occurred but the audience is building 
commitment to preserve the change. The 
maintenance stage is where th ere is aware of 
possible slip back or relapses to pervious stage or 
formal behaviour. This model is very imperative to 
understand how users can develop long lasting 
behaviour change during intervention programme. 
However, study [3 9] criticized the model th at the 
assumption on individuals typically making coherent 
and stable plans is not true. Human are known for 
incoherent and unstable decision and plans.  
 
2.3  The BDI Model Concept  
 
The above theories and models described different 
factors involved in behaviour change process 
however; there were  overlapping descriptions of 
these factors. It could be seen that many of these 
theories and models use d similar factor names 
whereas differen t concepts were being defined.  
Hence, the proposed BDI agent model was based on 
integration of these psychological theories and 
models of behaviour change as presented in Table 1.

Table 1 explicitly present ed relevant factors and 
model concept that were used in formalization of the 
BDI model  while  Figure 1 depicts the interaction of 
the identified agent’s factors that produce 
behaviour change.  
The agent’s belief is represented under the initial 
stage where in formation about the agent’s plan is 
conceived. This stage can also be a term information 
state where agent acquires knowledge and belief on 
its action. On the other hand, agent’s desire is 
represented in the reasoning stage where it is 
influenced by many o ther interplaying factors such 
as severity of the action, perceived benefit of the 
action to the agent and the nature of challenge the 
action is posing to agent’s plan and agent’s desire 
which form the reasoning stage of the agent.  
The action determinant stage house the agent 
intention and it is known as the deliberative state of 
an agent. This is the stage that depicts the action 
that an agent has chosen to perform. Intentions are desires to which the agent is somewhat committed 
to and this commitment is represented in the agent’s 
self-efficacy . 
 
 
3.0  FORMALIZATION  AND SIMULATION   
 
The arrows in Figure 2 denote causal dependencies 
of interplaying factors. The formalization of the model 
is based  on [40] with respect  to time ( t).  Derived from  
on the concept of the model  severity of behaviour 
(Sb) is the strictness of the consequences of 
behaviour . The designed model conceptualized the 
idea  that it is  high when both behaviour task  (Ba) 
and action reject (Ar) are high  which was formalized 
as shows in equation (1) .  
 
Sb (t) = Ba(t) [1-(1-Ar(t))]    (1)

Challenge ( Cg) is perceived obstacle  or 
impediment to target behaviour. From the designed 
model c hallenge is high when any two of ability ( Ab), 
social influence (Si) and motivation ( Mv) are high which 
was formalized as shown in equation (3). This same 
procedure was  used for the concept formalization of 
both perceived benefit ( Pb) and performed action 
(Pc) as presented in equations (4) and (5) respectively.  
 
Cg(t)=wc1.Ab(t) + w c2.Si(t) + w c3.Mv(t)                                  (3)

wm2 and  wm3 are the weight s factors  for the respective  
equation s. 
 
Similarly, motivation is the simulative drive and 
intrinsic interest in performing behaviour. Based on the 
designed model motivation is low if attitude to change 
(Ac) is low and one of ability,  challenge and social 
influence ( Si) are low as presented in equation (6). The 
attitude to Change (Ac) is the mental state which 
implies a formed view or perception about a 
behaviour. It is high when negative thoughts ( Ng) is low 
and any of behaviour knowledge ( Bk) or belief ( Bf) is high as presented in equation  (7). This same procedure 
was used for the concept formalization of equations 
(8), (9), (10), (11), (12) and (13).  
 
Mv (t) = σ ( wm1Ab(t) + wm2.Si(t) + wm3.Cg(t))  + (1 - σ) (Ac(t)) (7)

Hr (t) = ϕ  . Df(t) + [ (1 - ϕ) . Ng(t)]    (13) 
 
Likewise,  based on the designed model 
dissatisfaction  (Df) is the negative unpleasant feeling, 
negative expectati on and negative reaction from 
behaviour. Dissatisfaction (Df)  is high when negative 
thought  (Ng)  is high which was formalized in equation 
(6). The same procedure were used to formalized for 
consistency in action (Ca) and consistency refusal in 
action (Cr) as presented in equations (7) and (8).  Also, 
these equations  (14) to (15)  are known as the temporal 
equation of the model because they show the 
resultant outcome of behaviour . While equation s (1) to 
(13) are the instantaneous equations because they

Δt refers to the change rate in time ( t)     
 
Based on the formal model, the instantaneous 
formalization parameters represent the equalization of 
corresponded contribution towards the overall 
equations. In addition, parameters for temporal 
equations denote the contribution for change rate. The 
formal model was implemented in the numerical  
programming language  (Matlab ) using four case 
conditions as shown in Table 2.  In addition,  the weights 
(w) were assigned 0.33  respectively,  while all regulating 
parameters were assigned 0.5  based on suggestions 
made by [41] and [42] .

Each of the four case conditions defines different 
characteristics  that can be possessed  by an agent . For 
instance, uninspiring defines an agent  with high 
Behavioural task ( Ba) and low Planned action ( Pa), 
Ability ( Ab), Society influence ( Si), Behavioural 
knowledge ( Bk) and Belief ( Bf). While ability deficient 
defines an agent  with high Behavioural Tasks (Ba), 
Behavioural knowledge ( Bk) , and Belief ( Bf) but low in Planned action ( Pa), Ability ( Ab) and Society Influence 
(Si). Figure s 2, 3 4 and 5 illustrate the case condition 
simulatio n results. The simulation results show  the 
fundamental uniqueness of each case condition. T he 
established simulations reflected  that the model can 
account for related behavioural phenomen on. 
 
 
4.0  RESULT S   
 
Based on Figure 3 it can be  observed that 
dissatisfaction leads both consistency refusal in action 
and consist ency in action . Dissatisfaction was found to 
strike  up to the maximum level , whereas consistency in 
action  is de clining towards baseline level.  This implies 
that when an agent is experiencing this condition,  then 
its action will be characterized as “extremely high 
dissatisfaction ” and “extremely low consistency in 
action ” which indicates that the agent will experience  
difficulty to  perform  the ta rget behaviour . This later 
leads to extreme  susceptible towards  high 
dissatisfaction.  
Figure 4 depicts a result that was almost similar to 
the uninspiring case condition  attribution  as shown in 
Figure 3. However , the  range boundaries  between 
cases were n ot as significant  compared to cases as 
depicted in Figure 3. However , the dissatisfaction  level  
was found to influence  both consistency refusal in 
action and consistency in action . The margin between 
dissatisfaction and consistency refusal in action  levels  is 
wider than the margin between consistency refusal in 
action and consistency in action. This implies that when 
an agent acquires this case condition attribution then 
its action will be characterized by a high dissatisfaction 
and low consistency in actio n which indicates that the 
agent will not be able to consistently perform the 
target behaviour. The level of the agent’s 
dissatisfaction with the target behaviour is lower 
compared to the first case of condition attribution in 
Figure 3.

Figure 4Simulation of Belief Deficient Case Condition  
 
 
From Figure 5, it can be seen that dissatisfaction 
leads both consistency in action and consistency 
refusal. Nevertheless , by compar ing this result 
compared to other previous case condit ions (as shown 
in Figure 3 and 4) the level of  consistency in action was 
found to influence the  consistency refusal in action . 
Furthermore, the  consistency refusal in action level  is 
monotonically close to 0 , the while consistency in 
action was remain constant at 0.5. This is related  that 
when an agent acquires this case condition attribution 
then its action will be characterized by a high 
dissatisfaction whereas consistency in act ion 
performed will be possible at a very low and constant 
level. The agent will be able to achieve target 
behaviour . Nevertheless , due to the deficient in both 
ability and social influence , the agent will be highly 
dissatisfied with its achieved targets.  
Based on simulation traces as shown in Figure 6, it 
can be depict that consistency in action leads both  dissatisfaction and consistency refusal. It is worth it to 
show that there is a very wide lagging range margin 
between dissatisfaction and consistency refusal in 
action  and also a close leading range margin between 
consistency in action and dissatisfaction. This can be 
explained due to the low attribute of behaviour task . 
This result  is supported by  study [2 9], as it can be  
pointed out that when behaviour is not challenging 
then the probability of its being perform consistently will 
be low.  In other words, this implies that when an agent 
acquires this case condition attribution then its action 
will be characterized by a high consistency in action, 
reduced level in dissatisfaction and extremely low 
consistency refusal in action. The agent will be able to 
consistently perform the target behaviour while there 
will be a little level of di ssatisfaction due to low 
behaviour task.

5.0  MATHEMATICAL VERIFICATION   
 
For the mathematical verification, equillibria analysis is 
used to describe situations in models where the values 
(continuous) approach a limit under certain conditions 
and stabilize. It means, if the dynamics of a model is 
described by a differential equa tion, then equilibria 
can be estimated by setting a derivative (or all 
derivatives) to zero. One important note that an 
equillibria condition(s) is considered stable  if the model 
always returns to it after small disturbances. These 
equillibria conditions a re interesting to be explored, as it 
is possible to explain them using the knowledge from 
the theory or problem that is modelled. As such, the 
existence of reasonable equilibria is also an indication 
for the correctness of the model. To obtain possible 
equilibrium values for the other variables, first the 
temporal equations are described in a differential 
equation form.

𝑑𝐶𝑟 (𝑡)
𝑑𝑡=.[𝐴𝑟(𝑡)−𝐶𝑟(𝑡)].(1−𝐶𝑟(𝑡)).𝐶𝑟(𝑡)) 
 
Assuming the parameters ,,, are nonzero, from the 
equations X to Y, the following cases can be distinguish.  
 
 [𝑁𝑔(𝑡)−𝐷𝑓(𝑡)].(1−𝐷𝑓(𝑡)).(𝐷𝑓(𝑡))=[𝑃𝑐(𝑡)−
𝐶𝑎(𝑡)].(1−𝐶𝑎(𝑡)).𝐶𝑎(𝑡))=0 
[𝐴𝑟(𝑡)−𝐶𝑟(𝑡)].(1−𝐶𝑟(𝑡)).𝐶𝑟(𝑡))=0 
 
Later these cases can be distinguished into  
 
(𝑁𝑔=𝐷𝑓) ∨  (𝐷𝑓=1 )∨(𝐷𝑓=0) 
(𝑃𝑐=𝐶𝑎)∨(𝐶𝑎=1)∨(𝐶𝑎=0) 
(𝐴𝑟=𝐶𝑟)∨(𝐶𝑟=1)∨(𝐶𝑟=0) 
 
From here, a first of conclusions can be derived where 
the equilibrium can only occur when the Ng=D f, Df=1, 
or Df=0 .   
This later provides possible combinations equillibria 
points to be further analysed .  However due to the 
huge amount of possible combinations, (in this case, 
33= 27 possibilities), it makes hard to come up with a 
complete classification of equilibria. Howe ver, for some 
typical cases the analysis can be pursued further.

Case 1 ( Ng=Df )

Ac (t) = [γ  . Bk(t) + (1 - γ) . Bf(t)] [1-Df(t)] 
Hr (t) = ϕ  . Df(t) + [ (1 - ϕ) . Df(t)] 
 
Case 2 ( Pc = Ca ) 
Ar(t)=[w Ar1.Df(t)+w Ar2.Hr(t)+w Ar3.Pa(t)].(1-(Ca(t)) 
 
Case 3 ( Df = 0 ) 
Ar(t)=[ w Ar2.Hr(t)+w Ar3.Pa(t)].(1-(Pc(t))  
Hr (t) = (1 - ϕ) . Ng(t)   
 
All of these equilibria  conditions can be found in our 
simulation results.

 6.0  CONCLUSION   
 
This article presents the design of a BDI agent model of 
behavioural change intervention . The model depicts 
how agent’s behavioural factors interact to enhance 
behaviour change  and has been evaluated using 
mathematical analysis . This model will assist agent -
based intervention designers to further understand the 
mechanism behind agent -based behavioural change 
intervention. Therefore , it will en able the designers  to 
develop  an agent -based intervention  system  that will 
be void of reactance.  
 However, the model does not cover every aspect 
of human behaviour because human behaviour is as a 
result of complex interplay of factors that comprise of 
socio-demographic, cognitive, biological and 
environmental factors. Further studies that will be done 
on this model include using Tem poral Trace Language 
(TTL) to evaluate  the mode .  
Apart from a more thorough evaluation of the 
proposed models, there are seve ral directions for future 
research based on the work presented in this article. 
For example, it is beneficial to investigate how 
interactions and sensing properties can be further 
developed and enriched to achieve a more fluid 
embedding into an intelligent  support system.
