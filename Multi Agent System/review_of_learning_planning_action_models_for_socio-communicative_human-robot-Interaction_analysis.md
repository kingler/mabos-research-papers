# Review of "A Review on Learning Planning Action Models for Socio-Communicative HRI"

## Summary
The paper titled "A Review on Learning Planning Action Models for Socio-Communicative HRI" by Ankuj Arora, Humbert Fiorino, Damien Pellier, and Sylvie Pesty, presents an analysis of machine learning techniques for developing socio-communicative models for Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). Recognizing the necessity for social intelligence in robots for companionship, caretaking, and domestic help, the authors discuss the limitations of current behavior programming methods and propose that AI planning and machine learning could be leveraged to learn behavioral models from multimodal traces of interactions.
