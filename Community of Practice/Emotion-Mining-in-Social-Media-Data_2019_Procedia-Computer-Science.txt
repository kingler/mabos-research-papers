Abstract
Emotions are known to inﬂuence the perception of human beings along with their memory, thinking and imagination. Human
perception is important in today’s world in a wide range of factors including but not limited to business, education, art, and music.Microblogging and Social networking sites like Twitter, Facebook are challenging sources of information that allow people to
share their feelings and thoughts on a daily basis. In this paper we propose an approach to automatically detect emotions on Twitter
messages that explores characteristics of the tweets and the writer’s emotion using Support Vector Machine LibLinear model and
achieve 98% accuracy. Emotion mining gained attraction in the ﬁeld of computer science due to the vast variety of systems that
can be developed and promising applications like remote health care system, customer care services, smart phones that react based
on users’s emotion, vehicles that sense emotion of the driver. These emotions help understand the current state of user. In order
to perform suitable actions or provide suggestions on how user’s can enhance their feeling for a better healthy life-style we use
actionable recommendations. In this work we extract action rules with respect to the user emotions that help provide suggestions
for user’s.

1. Introduction
Emotion is a combinatorial result of a persons evaluation of a situation along with the physiological arousal [12].
Classiﬁcation of human emotions has been long under research since the early 60’s. One of the earliest studies [6]
suggests ‘anger’, ‘fear’, ‘enjoyment’, ‘sadness’, ‘disgust’, ‘surprise’ as the basic emotions Fig. 1universal for all
human beings. Any kind of information available holds a ‘meaning’ to it. Meaning has associated Connotation and
Denotation. Denotation is the dictionary meaning, while Connotation is the emotional association to the information.
For instance the words ‘childish’ and ‘childlike’ both have identical denotations, whereas the former has a more
insulting connotation when refered to a person and the latter has more positive meaning. According to researchers
Connotation has gained more attention with psychology. Thus emotion plays an important role in our understanding

of the information entities in day to day life. Internet naturally poses a wider platform for expressing this kind of
emotional information. One such prominent platform is ‘Social Media’ which includes online social networks like
‘Facebook’ and microblogs like ‘Twitter’ [11].
We use the dataset formed of messages collected from the popular microblogging platform Twitter. Users of this
platform tend to share their opinion or feelings about political events, natural disaster, products and companies, en-vironment, community and much more on a day-to-day basis. This kind of user information is of interest to diﬀerent
communities. For instance, tweets about environment, community from a particular county and state will help the
government oﬃcials understand the standard of living of people. This helps them make better amendments to the
policies for the well being of the people. In this paper we utilize Weka Aﬀective Tweets package [14] to explore the
tweet text characteristics such as the lexicon features, semantic features and word embeddings which are considered
to improve the classiﬁcation model performance [32], [5], [1].
Knowledge Discovery is the process of extracting interesting patterns and applying such patterns to speciﬁc areas
of interest. To ﬁnd such interesting patterns from data there are wide range of techniques likes classiﬁcation, rule
mining, clustering etc. Source of data in the era of internet has become huge with ﬁve V’s (Volume, Variety and Veloc-
ity, Veracity and Value)of deﬁning big data. With such huge amount of data being generated from variety of sources
it is obvious that the discovered knowledge might not be of much use to applications which are in need of speciﬁc
suggestions including smart phones, remote health care systems, customer care services, pedagogical approaches forteaching (student teacher evaluation), e-learning and other such applications. One of the major problem in the knowl-
edge discovery process is reducing the volume of discovered patterns and selecting the appropriate interestingness
measure [4]. One of the techniques to extract appropriate interseting patterns is action rules proposed by authors [24].Action rules are special types of rules which forms a hint to the users, show a way to reclassify objects with respect tosome distinguished attribute called the decision attribute. Emotion mining gained attraction in the ﬁeld of computerscience due to the vast variety of systems that can be developed and promising applications like remote health care
system, customer care services, smart phones that react based on users’s emotion, vehicles that sense emotion of the
driver. Emotions mined from text data is vast, in order to make sensible suggestions we use action rules that help
suggest ways to alter the user’s emotion to a better or more positive state.
2. Related Work
Sentiment Analysis involves use of natural language processing to identify and extract sentiment or opinion. There
is a wide range of literature covering the areas of text sentiment analysis which aims to classify the data with polarity
and also into further ﬁne grained emotion. In this section we include related works in the area of sentiment miningfrom text.

2.1. Sentiment and Emotion Mining
Authors Bruyne et al. [5] use ensemble of classiﬁers for the multi-class multi-label problem. They utilize diﬀerent
aspects of the tweet by extracting tweet features including lexicon features, n-gram features, syntactic, semantic
features, and word embeddings. They suggest that classiﬁer chain performs better than the individual binary classiﬁers.
Authors Himeno et al. [1] use convolutional neural networks to classify the tweet emotion intensity. Their idea
is based on the observation that n-grams have vital eﬀects to represent the tweet emotion. They achieve an averagecorrelation co-eﬃcient of 0.620.
Authors Turcu et al. [27] use supervised machine learning models like Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbor and
Support Vector Macines, and deep learning neural net tensor ﬂow model, decision tree for aﬀective tweets task and
achieve best accuracy of approximately 0.73 for emotion Joy.
Authors Mishne et al. [13] use blog text data to classify the writer’s emotion or mood. They train the SVMlight
model of Support Vector Mahine using signiﬁcant features extracted from the blog data. The features include fre-quency counts (words, Part-Of-Speech), and length of blog post; subjective nature of blogs like semantic orientation,
Point-wise Mutual Information (PMI) which is a measure of the degree of association between two terms; features
unique to online text like emphasized words, special symbols including punctuation’s, and emoticons.
Authors Yassine and Hajj [31] use undupervised techniques on facebook data to study the friendship relations and
emotions expression in online social networks. Similarly authors Sun et al. [26] use sentiment feedback on socialmedia data to improve item recommendations. They validate diﬀerent approaches including Support Vector Machines(SVM), SVM-Boosting, Naive Bayes and others along with the proposed ensemble learning-based sentiment classiﬁ-
cation method. It is observed that SVM method achieves best performance among all the machine learning classiﬁers
for sentiment detection, but the proposed ensemble method further helps to overcome the challenges associated withspecial features of aﬀective text and achieves an accuracy of 86.7%.
2.2. Actionable Pattern Mining and Applications
Actionability is a property of the discovered knowledge. If user’s can act upon a pattern and beneﬁt from the action,
these patterns are considered as actionable patterns. This section reviews literature for actionable pattern mining.
Action Rules are used to discover patterns in the form of rules called decision rules ’if ..., then... ’ [8]. These
patterns provide details about events in the past and suggestions for making prospective decisions. In medical ﬁeld,
for disease diagnosis, decision rules help identify the correlation between symptoms and sickness with the past dataand help diagnose new patients. Another prospective usefulness of decision rules is getting the desired eﬀect ondependent variables by building strategy of intervention on the independent variables. In the medical example, this
can be explained as modifying symptoms or treating symptoms to cure sickness.
Authors Tzacheva et al. [29], discover low cost actionable patterns and recommendations in distributed environ-
ment. They use the algorithm described by [3] and develop the system using Apache Spark framework and Hadoop
Distributed File System (HDFS) for scalability and eﬃciency. They evaluate the approach using car evaluation dataset,mammographic dataset and achieve best results.
In relation to Emotion mining, Actionable patterns may suggest a way to alter the user’s emotion from a negative,
or neutral to a more positive Emotion, or a desirable state /attitude. For example, for customer care services, recom-
mendation systems for online shopping, or smart phones that are able to recognize human emotions, Emotion altering
Actionable Patterns include: suggesting calming music, playing mood enhancing movie, changing the background
colors to suiting ones, or calling caring friends (for smart phones). In [22] the primary intent of the Action Rulesgenerated is to provide viable suggestions on how to make a twitter user feel more positive. For Twitter social network
data, Actionable Recommendations may include - how to increase user’s friends count, how to increase the user’s
follower’s count, and how to change the overall sentiment from negative to positive, or from neutral to positive.

3.1. Data Collection
Twitter streaming API is used to collect around 520,000 tweets as raw data. The tweets collected are ﬁltered
with English language tweets and are under general tweet category, sample tweet is shown in Table .1. The data
includes the following attributes TweetID, ReTweetCount, TweetFavouriteCount, TweetText, TweetLanguage, Tweet-Source, UserID, UserFollowersCount, UserFavouritesCount, UserFriendsCount, UserLocation, MediaEntities. The
overall methodology is shown in Fig .2.

If it looks like slavery, sounds like slavery, and the logic of slavery is used verbatim to justify it, then itA dream you dream alone is only a dream. A dream you dream together is reality.
3.2. Pre-Processing and Emotion Annotation
Tweets are generally informal and not syntactically well formed which can be attributed to limitation of 140 char-
acters. So the raw tweets need considerable pre-processing before further steps of emotion labeling, feature extraction
and classiﬁcation. We lowercase all the letters in the tweet, remove stop words, replace slang words with formal text,
example b4 →before, chk →check etc. After pre-processing we have around 200,000 tweets.
As part of emotion labeling we use the National Research Council - NRC Emotion lexicon [18], [17], [16], [15]
. The Annotations in the lexicon are at WORD-SENSE level. Each line has the format: <Term>< AﬀectCategory>
<AssociationFlag>. Term indicates the word for which the emotion associations are provided, AﬀectCategory indi-
cates one of the eight emotions (‘anger’, ‘fear’, ‘disgust’, ‘sadness’, ‘anticipation’, ‘joy’, and ‘trust’), and Associa-
tionFlag indicates one of two possible associations either ‘0’ (target word has no association with aﬀect category) or
‘1’ (target word has association with aﬀect category). Each tweet in the dataset is annotated with the corresponding
emotion based on the weightage computed using features such as word-sense, hashtags and emoticons. Thus we obtainannotated dataset where each record is labeled with coressponding emotions such as ‘anger’, ‘fear’, ‘disgust’, ‘sad-ness’, ‘anticipation’, ‘joy’, and ‘trust’. In the process of annotation additional score features are added to the dataset
which helps in the classiﬁcation process.
3.3. Tweet Feature extraction
In the literature wide range of features have been explored in the task of tweet sentiment analysis including uni-
grams, bigrams, n-grams, part-of-speech (POS) tags, word embedding, word clusters [19], [20], [30], [21], [1], [9]. In
this work we use TweetToSparseFeatureVector ﬁlter in Weka Aﬀective tweets [14] package to extract word n-grams,
character n-grams, brown word clusters and part-of-speech tags. The dataset with the following attributes is passed to

annotated dataset where each record is labeled with coressponding emotions such as ‘anger’, ‘fear’, ‘disgust’, ‘sad-ness’, ‘anticipation’, ‘joy’, and ‘trust’. In the process of annotation additional score features are added to the dataset
which helps in the classiﬁcation process.
3.3. Tweet Feature extraction
In the literature wide range of features have been explored in the task of tweet sentiment analysis including uni-
grams, bigrams, n-grams, part-of-speech (POS) tags, word embedding, word clusters [19], [20], [30], [21], [1], [9]. In
this work we use TweetToSparseFeatureVector ﬁlter in Weka Aﬀective tweets [14] package to extract word n-grams,character n-grams, brown word clusters and part-of-speech tags. The dataset with the following attributes is passed to

the Weka data mining software AngerScore, TrustScore, FearScore, SadnessScore, AnticipationScore, DisgustScore,
SurpriseScore, JoyScore, PositiveScore, NegativeScore, TweetLanguage, TweetSource, UserFollowersCount, User-FavoritesCount, UserFriendsCount, UserLanguage, MediaEntities, FinalEmotion, TweetTokens.
3.4. Classiﬁcation
Classiﬁcation is a supervised machine learning model that learns the data using labeled train set and predicts
the test set for which the model does not know the actual class labels. This model is further evaluated with the
help of validation measures like precision, recall, f1-measure, and accuracy. There are a wide range of classiﬁcationmodels available including Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, K Nearest Neighbor, Rule basedclassiﬁer and many more. In this paper we have used Support Vector Machine LibLinear [7] as a classiﬁcation modelfor automatically classifying Twitter dataset with ﬁne grained emotion. LibLinear is a open source package thatis considered to be eﬃcient for training large-scale problems. We use the data mining software WEKA (Waikato
Environment for Knowledge Analysis) [10] for emotion classiﬁcation.
3.5. Actionable Pattern Discovery
Actionability is a property of the discovered knowledge. Patterns are considered Actionable if the user can act upon
them, and if this action can beneﬁt the user, or help them to accomplish their goals. Action Rules mining is a method
to extract Actionable patterns from the data. Action Rules are rules that describe a possible transition of data from one
state to another more desirable state. The formal deﬁnition of action rules as described in [4] is given in deﬁnition 1.
Deﬁnition 1. By an Action Rule we mean an expression r =[t
1→t2], where t 1is an action term, and t 2is an atomic
action term.
Additionally, we assume, that Dom(t 2)={d}and Dom(t 1)⊆A, where A is a set of attributes.
The domain Dom(r )of Action Rule r is deﬁned as Dom(t 1)∪Dom(t 2).
Table 2. Information System S.
X Attribute a Attribute b Attribute c Attribute d
x1 a1 b1 c1 H
x2 a2 b2 c1 H
x3 a2 b1 c1 A
x4 a1 b1 c2 A
x5 a2 b1 c2 A
x6 a2 b2 c2 H
x7 a1 b1 c2 A
x8 a1 b2 c1 A
x9 a1 b1 c1 H
x10 a2 b2 c1 H
Consider the information system S in Table ??. Equation (1) and (2) are example Action Rules. According to
equation (1) r1says that if the value a2remains unchanged and value b will change from b2tob1for a given object x,
then it is expected that the value dwill change from HtoAfor object x. Clearly, Dom(r 1)={a,b,d}. In a similar way,
the rule r2in equation (2) says that if the value c2remains unchanged and value bwill change from b2tob1, then it is
expected that the value dwill change from HtoA, and Dom(r 2)={b,c,d}.
r1=[((a, a2∗(b,b2→b1))→(d,H→A)] (1)r2=[((c, c2∗(b,b2→b1))→(d,H→A)] (2)
Deﬁnition 2. Standard interpretation N sof action terms in S =(X,A,V) is deﬁned as follows:
1. If(a,a1→a2)is an atomic term, then
Ns((a,a1→a2))=[{x∈X:a(x)=a1},{x∈X:a(x)=a2}]
2. If t 1=(a,a1→a2)∗t and N s(t)=[Y1,Y2], then
Ns(t1)=[Y1∩{x∈X:a(x)=a1},Y 2∩{x∈X:a(x)=a2}].
Now we deﬁne [Y1,Y2]∩[Z1,Z2]as[Y1∩Z1,Y2∩Z2].
Assume that N s(t1)=[Y1,Y2]and N s(t2)=[Z1,Z2].
Then N s(t1∗t2)=Ns(t1)∩Ns(t2). Let r =[t1→t2]be an Action Rule, where N s(t1)=[Y1,Y2],N s(t2)=[Z1,Z2].
Deﬁnition 3. By support and conﬁdence of rule r we mean:
1. sup(r )=min{card (Y1∩Z1),card(Y2∩Z2)}
2. con f (r)=card(Y1∩Z1)
card(Y1).card(Y2∩Z2)
card(Y2)
if card (Y1)/nequal0, card (Y2)/nequal0, card (Y1∩Z1)/nequal0, card (Y2∩Z2)/nequal0
3. con f (r)=0otherwise
Now, let us consider the equation (1) for support and conﬁdence with example. For the rule r 1we have:
•Ns(a,a2→a2)=[{x2,x3,x5,x6,x10},{x2,x3,x5,x6,x10}]
•Ns(b,b2→b1)=[{x2,x6,x8,x10},{x1,x3,x4,x5,x7,x9}]
•Ns(a,a2→a2)∗(b,b2→b1)=[{x2,x6,x10},{x3,x5}]
•Ns(d,H→A)=[{x1,x2,x6,x9,x10},{x3,x4,x5,x7,x8}]
Therefore, for rule r1, support sup(r 1)=2, conﬁdence con f (r1)=3
3.2
2=1.
In this work we use the method proposed by authors bagavathi et al. [2] to extract action rules for the emotion
labeled Twitter dataset. The method 2 in [2] is to extract action rules by vertical split of the data. This method utilizes
association action rules [23] which follows iterative method to extract all possible action rules. In order to overcome
the computational complexity and expense, authors in [2] propose vertical data split method for faster computation
and parallel processing.
4. Experiments and Results
4.1. Classiﬁcation - Support Vector Machine
For experiments we use the processed dataset and classify using SVM LibLinear [7] classiﬁcation model. The
classiﬁer excludes the string type attribute, in this case the TweetTokens which is the text of the tweet. This is because
the text is processed in the feature extraction step to get additional attributes like word n-grams, brown word clusters,and part-of-speech tags. Thus we achieve an accuracy of 98%. The confusion matrix and precision, recall, f-measureis shown in Table. 3., and Table. 4respectively.
4.2. Action Rules
Inorder to identify what changes in attributes lead to change in emotion to a better positive state we extract action
rules from the emotion labeled dataset. The continous data is discretized to intervals with the help of WEKA data min-ing software using unsupervised attribute discretization.

The domain Dom(r )of Action Rule r is deﬁned as Dom(t 1)∪Dom(t 2).

Deﬁnition 2. Standard interpretation N sof action terms in S =(X,A,V) is deﬁned as follows:

Ns(t1)=[Y1∩{x∈X:a(x)=a1},Y 2∩{x∈X:a(x)=a2}].
Now we deﬁne [Y1,Y2]∩[Z1,Z2]as[Y1∩Z1,Y2∩Z2].
Assume that N s(t1)=[Y1,Y2]and N s(t2)=[Z1,Z2].
Then N s(t1∗t2)=Ns(t1)∩Ns(t2). Let r =[t1→t2]be an Action Rule, where N s(t1)=[Y1,Y2],N s(t2)=[Z1,Z2].
Deﬁnition 3. By support and conﬁdence of rule r we mean:

the original dataset are used experimental purpose. The dataset with 174688 instances is divided into 100 parts based
on the target attribute ‘FinalEmotion’. Action rules are generated for one part of teh dataset. The sample action rules
are shown in Fig. 3.
Let us consider the action rule AR1, this rule suggest possible chnges to achiece a desirable emotional state of
‘joy’. If user tends to use more positive words as denoted by ( LOVES CORE ,0→1) and reduce the negative words
denoted by (S adnessS core, 2→0) then it is possible to change the emotion from ‘sadness’ to ‘joy’. In that case, the
emotion associated with this user tweet can be classiﬁed as ‘joy’. This example is more intutive in case of applications
where it is required to monitor people emotions in a particular city or county in order to understand the life satisfaction
and help in public policy making and societal well-being measures.
5. Conclusions
In this work we automatically detect user emotion from tweet data using the NRC Emotion Lexicon [18], [17] to
label the Emotion class for our data. We use Support Vector Machine LibLinear implementation and features including
word n-grams, character n-grams, brown word clusters, and part-of-speech tags and achieve a 10% improved accuracycompared to the previous method [28]. Also we extract action rules to identify what factors can be improved inorder for a user to attain more desirable positive emotion/feeling. Identifying emotions from text is an emerging area
of research and has its roots in many disciplines including Psychology, Neuro Science, Social Science, Computer
Science and many more. Systems that identify emotions and suggest actionable recommendations has wide variety
of applications like: improving the teaching models and learning outcomes from student evaluations, understanding
customer satisfaction surveys and how it can help improve business. In future we plan to extend our work towardsstudent evaluations of teaching in identifying student emotions towards Active learning models and factors that helpimprove student’s overall satisfaction and performance using actionable pattern discovery.
