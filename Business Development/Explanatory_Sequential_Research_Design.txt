Introduction Learning English has become really important to most Filipino students. Knowing English has been considered as an enabler to open door to success nationally and internationally. Students from various disciplines and fields need to learn English to increase their knowledge or gather information in their field. Therefore, they need to read and comprehend English books, magazine, and articles to catch up with advanced knowledge. Week after week, teacher assign academic text for students to read and comprehend; in fact, for most courses this is the this is the principal mode of teaching (Clerehan, 1995). Further, a predominant pattern in these courses is for classroom instruction to be characterized by teachers lecturing and students taking notes. To assist understanding, most learners take notes of the important thing they are reading. Reading comprehension is the process of constructing meaning from text. The goal of all reading instruction is ultimately targeted at helping a reader comprehend text. Reading comprehension involves at least two people: the reader and the writer. The process of comprehending involves decoding the writer's words and then using background knowledge to construct an approximate understanding of the writer's message. Reading comprehension is also affected by the quality of the reading material. Some writers are better writers than others, and some writers produce more complex reading material than others. Text that is well organized and clear is called "considerate text," and text that is poorly organized and difficult to understand can be called "inconsiderate text." The more inconsiderate the text, the more work will be required of a reader to comprehend the text. Readers who do not have the background, abilities, or motivation to overcome the barriers presented in inconsiderate text will have more difficulty comprehending these types of

It is generally understood that reading comprehension is an interactive mental process between a reader’s linguistic knowledge, knowledge of the world, and knowledge about a given topic. While reading, the reader constructs various representation of the text that are important for comprehension. Field (2002) argues that those representation include the surface code (the exact words of the text), the text code (main ideas representing the meaning of the text), and the mental models (the way in which information is presented in mind) that are embedded in the text, according to Nunan(2003), reading comprehension is a fluent process of combining information from the text and existing schemata to understand the meaning. Therefore, reading for comprehension or meaning is one of the primary purposes of reading. The Sisters of Mary School is a charitable institution established by Venerable Aloysius Phillip Schwartz that provides students a quality and secondary education extent to integration aligned to the needs of the students in school. However, students’ learning ability has turned into very competitive phenomenon in school students’ level of reading comprehension were affected by students’ learning habit entitled note taking were most of the students’ discussion were modulated orally and mostly, presented wordily. Unfortunately, some students are having difficulty in complying and fulfilling their notes that cause a farther understanding on their lesson, discussion, and comprehension task given by the instructor. The ARDC made several research and study on how to improve the students’ learning interest which is the note taking in coping students’ achievement. Statement of the Problem   
4                                               EXPLANATORY SEQUENTIAL MIXED METHOD RESEARCH DESIGNIn this study the researcher will explore, investigate, and observe the influence of note-taking as study habit on the level of reading comprehension of the Grade 9 students in the Sisters of Mary School Adlas-Inc. In line with this the researcher sought to answer the following questions: 1.What is the level of note taking skill of the 9th Grader? 2.What is the level of reading comprehension of Grade 9 student? 3.What is the relationship between the level of note taking skill and the level of reading comprehension of the grade 9 students? 4.Do the Grade 9 students employ effective note-taking skill to succeed on their comprehension task in their language learning classroom? Hypothesis  Pertaining to the major problems of this study, the hypothesis will put into test: Null Hypothesis •There is no significance relationship between the level note taking skill and the level of reading comprehension skill. Assumptions 
5                                               EXPLANATORY SEQUENTIAL MIXED METHOD RESEARCH DESIGNThe assumption was as follow: •The interest of the Grade 9 students in note-taking is influence by their perception, teacher, family, companions or friends, and by their career.

Brief explanation of the paradigm  The format of a lecture could play a role. In live lectures, for instance, note-taking will lead to a higher cognitive load because it needs to happen simultaneously, whereas when viewing lecture recordings students have the option to stop the recording to take notes. Consequently, they will miss fewer details when they are engaging in note-taking and the notes are probably going to be of higher quality. Frequently it is proposed that summarizing when taking notes is the best quality level. In any case, rewording requires subjective exertion and the threat is that if a talk is excessively unpredictable or quick paced, understudies – especially ones with lower earlier learning or lower intellectual capacities – will rapidly arrive at their handling limit prompting a breakdown of perception inside and out. Therefore, in such cases it can really be progressively useful to take all the more verbatim notes rather and perhaps defer rewording and association of notes until after the talk. Essentially in light of the fact that a bigger number of notes are superior to no notes.  
7                                               EXPLANATORY SEQUENTIAL MIXED METHOD RESEARCH DESIGNScope and Delimitation  This study entitled “Examining the Impact of Note-Taking Activity as a Perceived Factor Affecting Grade 9 students’ level of Reading Comprehension” in the community of the Sisters of Mary School-Adlas, Inc. during the Academic School year 2018-2019 focuses on how the note-taking is perceived by the grade 9 students and how it affects the level of Reading Comprehension Skill of the Grade 9 students. The researcher will choose a sample on the population of the Grade 9 students; 214 students (10 Family Saint will use as stratum) for quantitative phase of the study to generalize the findings, and 10 students (1 per section) for qualitative phase. Significance of the Study  This study would be a great help to the following: ARDC (Administrative Research Development Center) •This study will help them in basic leadership procedure of directing different movement line up with the note taking propensity and perusing understanding through this they might have the option to build up the aptitude in note taking and perusing perception. Faculty •This study will give them updates on the significance of note taking as study propensity and perusing appreciation in their showing subject, explicitly in English. Students of the Sisters of Mary School-Adlas, Inc.

Future researcher •This study shall give them noteworthy information and data about the impact of note taking as study propensity on the degree of perusing appreciation. It will fill in as their premise and guide for future formative member inquire about. Definition of Terms Note Taking •Notetaking is the practice of writing down pieces of information in a systematic way. By taking notes, the writer records the essence of the inform. Study Habit •It is the habitual practices that students use to help themselves study and learn. It is the behaviors use when preparing for test or learning academic materials. (T’boli, 2001) Reading Comprehension •is the act of understanding what you are reading. It is one of the pillars of the act of reading. Skills •the ability to use one knowledge effectively and reading in execution or performance. •A skill is the ability to carry out a task with determined results often within a given amount of time, energy, or both. Skills can often be divided into domain-general and domain-specific skills. For example, in the domain of work, some general skills would include time management, teamwork and leadership, self-motivation and others, whereas domain-specific skills would be used only for a certain job. Skill usually requires certain environmental stimuli and situations to assess the level of skill being shown and used. 
9                                               EXPLANATORY SEQUENTIAL MIXED METHOD RESEARCH DESIGN Chapter II Review of Related Literature This chapter presents and discusses related literature taken from books, journals, and electronic journals or books about the influence of note-taking as study habit on the level of reading comprehension of the students in their language learning classroom. The review is divided into subtopics such as discussing independent and dependent variables separately and relating it to each other and synthesis at the end of the review.  According to Marsh and Sink (2010), note taking is useful for two main reasons. First, note taking helps learning a lecture by stimulating focusing ability and engagement of the learner’s cognitive process such as coding, synthesizing, integrating, and transforming of aural information into meaningful inputs. Second, it is believed as a useful act because those taken notes will serve as a database of information that later helps learners revising and reviewing to recall the information heard in the lecture. Roy et al. (2014) reported that application of the note taking precisely increase the ability of the reader in taking notes and help them to remember some details and also increase their proficiency in listening, so it is beneficial to be used in language learning classroom. Doing effective note-taking can lead into increase of students learning. It helps the students recognize how information is structured and would help them summarize what they read or hear. 
10                                               EXPLANATORY SEQUENTIAL MIXED METHOD RESEARCH DESIGNReading comprehension is a process through which an individual try to explore the meaning or message laid in the text explicitly or implicitly through using some strategies that will help the students to comprehend better, for intense; by asking questions, presumption, and guessing. According to Field (2000), when reader is reading a given topic or selection, he/she deals with some fundamental aspects of comprehending and realizing the text. It means that he/she thinks what the exact meaning of the word or what special meaning it has in the specific sentence or text; because one of the important things about reading is the meaning or idea that laid in the text and how the reader reconstructs the information in their mind because it is a mental process. The role of reading comprehension is essential for students in their achievement whereas first line information and advancement in technology and knowledge normally published in English. Reading comprehension is complicated mental activity in which the reader predicts or verifies the information conveyed in the text by using previous experience, information, or knowledge and also an interaction between both reader and writer through the text where main outcome would by comprehension. Note taking is a necessary instrument that helps the students to gather information in the text that they read and to save information in their mind better because students may have to memorize them and need them later. According Benton and Kim (2000), summarizing notes will more beneficial if the students highlights the fundamental words, sentences, and phrases in the given text and rewrite it in another way. Note taking makes students interested to the lesson and cause them read more carefully and do not be bored in the class and they will be more focus on the sorting and coding of the context information. Students who can effectively summarize text knows how to synthesize information and have a higher order of thinking skill which includes 
11                                               EXPLANATORY SEQUENTIAL MIXED METHOD RESEARCH DESIGNanalyzing information, identifying key concepts, and defining extraneous information. In past years studies shows that learning note-taking skill improve students’ reading skill and precisely are useful to make progress in reading the task of their lesson (Chamot, 1990; Carel, 1998; Taraban, 2004; Phakiti, 2006; Mamdoodi, 2011; & Dunke, 2012) The reviewed literature, is all about Note taking as a study about of the students wherein note taking is useful in two main reasons according to Marsh and Sink (2010). The first reason is that the students can easily understand the topic discussed by the teacher and also it helps the students focus during the discussion by listening attentively while taking notes. The second reason is that note taking is useful as a database information that helps the learner in revising and reviewing their lesson. In the second study it is all about the reading comprehension, studies of Field (2000), that when the students are reading, he/she is dealing with some aspects of comprehension like realizing the exact meaning of the certain text. Finally, the reviewed studies concluded that the students must do note taking that helps the students to gather more information while listening and it will become beneficial of, they summarize it and memorizing it with perseverance.

Chapter III Research Method    In this study, Mixed Method approach will used as research design. Furthermore, the researchers use Explanatory Sequential Design as research strategy in understanding the influence of note-taking skill as study habit of Grade 9 students on their level of reading comprehension skill. According ARDC module, this design implies that quantitative phase will be done first, then follow up with qualitative phase and interpretation of the result, as the researchers of this study deals with two variables, the note-taking skill and the reading comprehension skill of the Grade 9 students that seems a problem that needed an action. Design   This study used the explanatory sequential research method which is designed for the researchers to gather information about present existing conditions needed in the chosen field of 
13                                               EXPLANATORY SEQUENTIAL MIXED METHOD RESEARCH DESIGNstudy. This method enables the researchers to interpret the theoretical meaning of the findings and hypothesis development for further studies. Based from the definition of Calderon & Gonzales (2007) explanatory sequential research is concerned with conditions of relationships that exist; practices that prevail; beliefs; processes that are going on; effects that are being felt, or trends that are developing. The process of descriptive research goes beyond mere gathering and tabulation of data. It involves the elements or interpretation of the meaning or significance of what is described. Thus$ description is often combined with comparison and contrast involving measurements, classifications, interpretation and evaluation. Population and Sampling The researchers will select 214 Grade 9 students of the SOMS-Al as the respondents of the study to represent the population of 508 Grade 9 students.  To get the sample, researchers will use the Stratified Probability Sampling using Slovin’s Formula (n = N / (1 + Ne2). The researcher uses the stratum of the Family Saint of Grade 9 students. Ratio and proportion will utilize. From the population of 508 Grade9 students comprising of 44 students in St. John Bosco, 43 students in St. Martin, 45 students in St. Jerome, 45 students in St. Alphonsus, 41 students in St. Dominic, 35 students in St. Albert, 39 students in St. Edmund, 44 students St. Gregory, 38 students in St. Bernard, and 43 students in St. Isaac. 214 respondents comprising of 20 students for the following family saint St. John Bosco, St. Martin, St. Jerome, St. Gregory, and St. Isaac; 21 students in both St. Maximillian and St. Alphonsus; 19 students in St. Dominick and St. Edmund; 18 students in St. Bernard; and lastly, 16 students in St. Albert. 
14                                               EXPLANATORY SEQUENTIAL MIXED METHOD RESEARCH DESIGN In qualitative phase the researcher will select 10 sample from 214 sample from quantitative phase using purposive non-probability sampling. Respondents of the Study The target respondents in this study were the Grade nine (9) students of Sisters of Mary School-Adlas, Inc. School year 2019-2020. The determined sample size for the study were 214 respondents. In selecting the correct respondents that will represent the whole population, the researcher used stratified random sampling. In this type of sampling technique, the researcher divided first divided each number of students per family saint by the total population of 508 and then multiply by the determined sample size of 214. In qualitative phase uses purposive sampling technique to select the respondents from 214 respondents in quantitative phase. Research Instrument The research instruments used in the study are survey forms (checklist and rating scale), interviews and observation schedule. These chosen instruments will be used in the collection of data are to test the validity and reliability of the research study being conducted. Survey forms will be used in data collection. A systematically prepared form with a set of questions designed to get and produce responses from respondents. Researchers already have a ready-made and comprehensive set of questions. Structured survey form will be used. At the first part of the 
15                                               EXPLANATORY SEQUENTIAL MIXED METHOD RESEARCH DESIGNsurvey form, a Likert Scale is used. A Likert scale is a psychometric scale. When responding to a Likert questionnaire item, respondents specify their level of agreement to a statement. The scale is named after its inventor, psychologist Rensis Likert. In a Likert scale prepared by the researchers there are 5 Likert items. This Likert items are inside a table, each column heads have a corresponding scale (very bad, bad, neutral, good, and very good) on which a subject indicates his or her response by checking tick-marks. These scales are used to see how the buyers or potential buyers of apparels perceive different placement factors inside a store. At the second part of the survey form, short questions are given along with the choices given below each question and the respondent will indicate his or her response by checking tick-marks. This instrument is convenient in the part of both the researcher and the respondents because it saves the survey takers some time, especially when they are busy people Interviews will be used to meet face-to-face with individuals to interact and generate ideas coming from the buyers or potential buyers. It is an interaction in which oral questions are posed by the interviewer to get and produce oral response from the interviewee. The researcher has to identify a potential source of information, and structure the interaction in a manner that will bring out relevant information from the respondents. Unstructured interview will be used, which is less formal, casual type. Sets of questions will be used. The interviewer freely modifies the sequence of questions, rephrase/paraphrase and sometimes explains them or adds to them during the interview. This will be used to project a free, flexible and relaxed interaction. Observation will also be used to obtain data, in order to obtain first-hand information about the stores’ placement and the buyer’s attraction towards apparel’s placement that will lead to their decision-making. Both oral and visual data are recorded to see the real-time situation and to know the behavior of the buyers in the actual place. 
16                                               EXPLANATORY SEQUENTIAL MIXED METHOD RESEARCH DESIGNWith this instrument, the researcher may become a participant observer and a non-participant observer according to Dr. Godfred Annum. The researchers will become a participant observer. The researchers will get along with the subjects of the study while observing and keeping notes of the attributes of the subject that is being researched so that he can directly experience the phenomena being studied. Even though he is seen by the subjects of the study, he conceals his real identity as a researcher.  Validation of the Instrument In the validation process of this study, copies of the questionnaire and copies of the research questions were given to some faculty member. These experts went through the research questions and the questionnaire carefully to ascertain the appropriateness and adequacy of the instrument. They suggested structuring the questionnaire in the Likert fashion, on a five-point scale instead of modified 4 points Likert fashion. Researcher prefers the modified Likert scale because according to normal Likert scale, strongly agree assigns 5 points, agree 4 points, undecided 3 points, disagree 2 points and strongly disagree 1 point. Many researchers and educationists feel that there is no logical enough reason to assign the weight of 3 points to somebody who is undecided on a given issue. Therefore, the modified 4 Likert scale is preferred. However, the other useful observations and suggestions by the experts were modified, and the corrections were made. Data Gathering Procedure 
17                                               EXPLANATORY SEQUENTIAL MIXED METHOD RESEARCH DESIGN The following procedure will be used for gather the important data and give a significant result of this study Phase 1 Preparation for Data Gathering  The researchers made a letter for allowing them to gather data that address toward the office and the sister-in-charge of the respondents. Phase 2 Gathering Data for Quantitative Part  After all the letter were signed by the instructor and the principal, the researchers went to the respondents and distribute the questionnaires for reading comprehension and note-taking test that is adopted from other researchers. Phase 3 Analyzing the Number Data  The researcher analyzed the gathered data to know it there is relationship between the two variables using the different statistical tools. Phase 4  Gathering Data for Qualitative Part 
18                                               EXPLANATORY SEQUENTIAL MIXED METHOD RESEARCH DESIGN The researchers selected the 5 highest and the 5 lowest scorers in the test for in-depth interview using semi-structured questionnaire made the researchers from the result of the quantitative part. Phase 5  Thematic Analysis The researchers get the important codes in said interview and analyzed then the number data by means of codes and categories. The Statistical Treatment and Data Analysis The researchers manually tabulated and processed the data after reconciling acquired data to get the specific way of analyzing and interpreting the results. In treating the gathered data, the following instrument were applied: 1.Chi-Square Test of Independence   Comparing two variables in the contingency table to see if they are related. It is also used to determine if there a significant relationship between two nominal (categorical) variables. The frequency of each category for one nominal variable is compared across the categories of the second nominal variable. Formula: = Chi-Square test of independence= Observed value of two nominal variables=Expected value of two nominal variables Degree of freedom is calculated by x2=∑(o−e)2e
