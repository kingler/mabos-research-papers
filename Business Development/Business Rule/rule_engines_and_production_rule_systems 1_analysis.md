# Title: Rule Engines and Production Rule Systems

## Summary:
The introductory chapter of the document on "Rule Engines and Production Rule Systems" explores the foundational aspects of artificial intelligence (AI) and the use of rule engines in complex decision-making systems. The text delves into the historical context of AI, the principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR), and the specific functionalities of rule engines and production rule systems (PRS). It highlights the advantages and appropriate use cases of rule engines, the underlying Rete algorithm, and the development of hybrid reasoning systems (HRS).
