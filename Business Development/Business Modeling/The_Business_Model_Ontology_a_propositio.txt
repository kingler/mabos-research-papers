The Business Model Ontology - a proposition in a design science approac h 
1 1 INTRODUCTION  
1.1  BACKGROUND AND RESE ARCH CONTEXT  
1.1.1  Economic Context  
The ideas for this research on business models  emerged when e-business, e-commerce and the so -
called new economy where blooming and booming. At that time many people in business and  
academe used to believe that the Internet would make existing business rules or even economic  
theories and laws obsolete  (e.g. Merrifield 2000; Wood 2000) . One could often hear that traditional  
business models were dead and that new business models were emerging. The term became a  
buzzword and was used by man agers, academ ics and journalists for everything and nothing related to  
the "new economy ", an economy driven by ICTs . However, I started this research at the end of  
October 2000 when the so-called dotcom bubble just burst and technology stocks where in full d ecline 
(see Figure 1). This was a little bit disturbing because the expression business model, the core of my  
research, was largely associated to the  "new economy " (e.g. Boulton and Libert 2000) . Furthermore,  
many and particular the press decided in the year 2000 that the idea of business models was dead. Was 
I supposed to drop my research?  
I decided to  stick to the expression and  to the  research on business models and see what the future  
would bring, because my conceptual perception of business models has little to do with the press' and  
mainstream publics' perception of business models. Though the exces sive dotcom hype negatively  
earmarked the expression I believed the concept of business models would reemerge as a helpful  
instrument in management. This proved to be the right decision, as the appearance of a decent research 
stream on business models in m anagement and information systems has shown.

1.1.2  Academic Background and Context  
After achieving a degree in political science and  then business information systems of the  University  
of Lausanne, Switzerland I decided to stay at my alma mater as a doctoral candidate. I started  to work  
as a research assistant under Professor Yves Pigneur at the Information Systems Department, where I  
taught and conducted research on business  models. In the course of time I  also started to rediscover 
my interest in developing countries, which I had developed during my studies in political science.  
Thus, besides setting up an interfaculty seminar on Information Technology (ICT) and development,  I 
tried to combine my core research with the subject of the seminar and the reader will notice that some  
of the examples in this dissertation are ICT -based business models from the "South". Furthermore, I  
was partially involved in a research project calle d MICS: Mobile Information and Communication  
Systems of the National Centers of Competence in Research (NCCR) and managed by the Swiss  

Introduction  
2 National Science Foundation on behalf of the Federal Authorities. Hence, you will also find some  
illustrations and cases from the mobile industry in this thesis.  
1.2  RELEVANCE AND RESEA RCH GOALS  
Although the dotcom bubble has burst it is clear that the Internet and other ICTs are here to stay and  
companies have to cope with them. Beyond the Internet hyperbole of the late 90s,  few experts deny  
that the Internet, the WWW, e-commerce and e-business have had and will continue to have an  
enormous impact on businesses. This is best illustrated by the so -called Hype Cycle of Gartner  
(Linden and Fenn 2003) , a technology research and advisory firm. Gartner's Hype Cycle, introduced  
as early as 1995, characterizes the typ ical progression of an emerging technology from over -
enthusiasm through a period of disillusionment to an eventual understanding of the technology's  
relevance and role in a market. Today it is clear that ICTs and particularly the Internet have changed  
the business landscape and that they are relevant for conducting business. The impact has been huge,  
even if traditional business rules have not been abrogated, as some authors have suggested during the  
hype (e.g. Merrifield 2000) .  
In my opinion one of the major impacts of ICTs has been an increase in the possible business  
configurations a company can adopt because of  the reduced coordination and transaction costs  (see 
Coase 1937; Williamson 1975) . In other words, they can increasingly work in partnerships, offer joint  
value propositions, build -up multi -channel and multi -owned distribution networks and pr ofit from  
diversified and shared revenue streams. This, however, means that a company's business has more  
stakeholders, becomes more complex and is harder to understand and communica te (for more details  
see section  2.1). If thi s assumption is true one can argue that the existing management  concepts and  
tools may not be sufficient enough anymore and that new ones have to be found.  For example,  
Rentmeister and Klein  (2003)  call for new modeling methods in the domain of business models.  
Effectively, a whole range of authors propo se using the relatively new concept of business models for  
managing companies in the Internet era  (Chesbrough and Rosenbloom 2000; Afuah and Tucci 2001;  
Applegate 2001; Pateli and Giaglis 2003) . This dissertation is part of this new research stream on  
business models and focuses on a specific area not so well covered until now:  specifying and  
conceptualizing  business models. Whereas most business model research stays at a non -conceptual , 
broad and sometimes even vague level, this work tries to dig into the details and define a generic  
model to describe business models. Such an approach is indispensable if one does not only want to  
provide rather simple management concepts, but effective software -based business model tools to  
improve managing in a rapidly moving, complex and uncertain business environment.  
The research question  of this dissertation  is: 
How can business models be described and represented in order to build the foundation for  
subse quent concepts and tools, possibly computer based?  
To tackle this question  I design and propose a  rigorous conceptual  model  of business models, which I  
subsequently call  an ontology. Gruber  (1993)  defines an ontology as an explicit specification of a  
conceptualization. It can be understood as  a description (like a formal specification of a program) of  
the concepts and relationships in a specific domain. In the domain of IS ontologies were originally  
used in artificial intelligence and knowledge engineering. Now its  importance is being recogniz ed in  
research fields as diverse as knowledge representation, qualitative modelling, language engineering,  
database design, information modelling, information integration, object -oriented analysis, information  
retrieval and extraction, knowledge management  and organization, and agent -based systems design.  
Current application areas of ontologies are also disparate, including enterprise integration, natural  
language translation, medicine, mechanical engineering, standardization of product knowledge,  
electroni c commerce , geographic information systems, legal information systems 2, biological  
information systems (Guarino 1998) .  
What I call an ontology can also be understood as a reference model. Duce and H opgood (1990)  refer 
to a reference model as follows: "The two words "reference" and ‘model’ establish  the overall intent  
[..] A ‘reference’ is something which can be referred to as an authority. A ‘model’ is a standard or  
example for imitation or comparison. It provides a pattern on which to base an artifact.  Duce, 
The Business Model Ontology - a proposition in a design science approach  
3 Giorgetti et al.  (1998)  see reference models as "a basis for a new type of system which exhibits  
significant advantages over previous approaches; a basis for explaining deficiencies in existing  
systems and showing ways of overcoming these; as a framework within which systems may be  
compared and new systems designed ". Reference models exist in many different domains, for instance 
in supply chain management  (SCC 2003) , networking  (ISO 2003)  or visualization systems  (Wood 
1998) . However , because the term ontology is gaining increasing weight and acceptance in the  
information systems and computer science community and besides other things stands for the  
definition of semantics and syntax in a domain I will subsequently refer to my modelin g approach as a 
domain ontology. This seems to suit the business model ontology quite well, as it aims at defining the  
concepts and their relationships in the business model domain. Yet, it must be said that there are  
different degrees of rigor and formaln ess in an ontological approach. The business model ontology and 
its business model modeling language BM2L can be understood as semi -formal in the sense of Ushold  
and Gruninger (1996)  and are " expressed in an artificial formally defined language ".  
Based  on the above, my research goal is to tackle the concept of business models with an ontological  
approach in order to provide the basis for new management tools. In the general terms of Ushold and  
King (1995)  this means:  
• Identification of the key concepts  and relationships in the domain of interest (i.e. scoping the  
domain of business models)  
• Production of precise unambiguous text definitions for such concepts and relationships  
• Identification of terms to refer to such concepts and relationships  
• Agreeing on all of the above  
The outcome of this research is a generic business model ontology that shall ideally represent the  
foundation for new management tools in strategy and information systems, possibly software based.  
One simple prototype tool that shall be pr ovided in this dissertation aims at facilitating the description  
of a business model.  
Subsequent tools based on the business model concept (but not researched in this dissertation)  are 
necessary for the following reasons:  
• Today's business landscape is cha racterized by complexity and uncertainty, based among other 
things on the dominant influence of ICTs and the resulting large range of possible business  
models. Yet, the concepts and tools to cope with this are still missing  
• Increasingly, today's business models demand the coordination of a large number of  
stakeholders, such as partners, strategists, business process designers and information systems  
staff. But so far few management tools exist to understand, map and share the business logic  
of today's firms . 
• After an initial hype of over -funded, megalomaniac business models, rigorous business  
planning for profitability has become indispensable  again considering today's fierce global  
competition. This means that all parts of a business have to be optimized an d reinforcing and  
that details in a business model make  the difference. Yet, few approaches and concepts exist  
that give an overall view of a business.  
As I will explain in the next section on the dissertation's methodology (see section  1.3) the research  
goals can be summarized as the delivery of a business model ontology (see section  4), its validation  
(see section  17) and the demonstration of some p ossible applications (see section  6). 
1.3  METHODOLOGY  
Finding an adequate founding in methodology was not easy, given that the goals of this research do  
not necessarily follow mainstream management or IS research directions. Tradi tional research in these 
areas often focus on theory building and theory testing. At first glance, working on a generic business  
model framework might also seem like theory work. But if business model research is certainly  
theoretical it does not mean that  it is a theoretical contribution to science as commonly understood. In 
Introduction  
4 a special issue of the Academy of Management Review dedicated to theory, David A. Whetten (1989)  
nicely defines a framework of  what constitutes a theoretical contribution. Central to his framework and 
to theory building is the notion of understanding the WHY of a phenomenon in question. Theory helps 
discerning how things come to be as they are and how they function. This is the case for theory  
building on natural as well as on social phenomena. Simply put, theory helps explaining patterns  
found in our world.  
The nature of business model research, however, is quite different. The reasoning behind business  
model research is not the  understanding of a phenomenon, rather it is a problem -solution finding  
approach. It is about finding the concepts and relationships that allow expressing the business logic of  
a firm in order to be able to formally seize this business logic. It means desi gning and building a  
model that makes it possible to represent the business model of a firm. The question that must  
immediately follow is, if this is valid and viable research or if it is mere consultancy work, meaning  
finding a solution to a problem. This  question is significant because the research in this dissertation  
neither contributes to theory building as defined above nor to theory falsification and testing, which is  
the second major scientific preoccupation. So can a problem -solution finding approa ch as applied in  
this business model research qualify as a scientific method, specifically in IS? If we consider science  
in the light of Kuhn’s scientific paradigms  (Kuhn 1970)  this depends on the scientific context of the  
moment. Paradigms are a collection of beliefs shared by scientists, a set of agreements about how  
problems are to be understood. Thus, the next step in finding out if business model resear ch qualifies  
as scientific is looking for an accepted problem -solution finding method that can be applied to this  
dissertation. As a matter of fact, there exists a scientific research method applied to IS baptised design 
science (March and Smith 1995; Au 2001; Ball 2001)  that can – with some modifications – be use d in 
developing a business model framework. The essence of design science was nicely expressed by  
Buckminster Fuller  (1992) , an architect, engineer, mathematician, poet, cosmologist and forerunner of  
design science. “The function of what I call design science is to solve problems by introducing into the 
environment new artifacts, the availabilit y of which will induce their spontaneous employment by  
humans and thus, coincidentally, cause humans to abandon their previous problem -producing 
behaviours and devices. For example, when humans have a vital need to cross the roaring rapids of a 
river, as a design scientist I would design them a bridge, causing them, I am sure, to abandon  
spontaneously and forever the risking of their lives by trying to swim to the other shore".  
Translated to this dissertation, design science means designing a business model  framework that helps 
managers and IS specialist express the business logic of a firm in a new way, abandoning the former  
informal business logic descriptions. This is in line with Nunamaker, Chen et al.  (1990)  who classify  
design science in IS as applied research that  applies knowledge to solve practical problems.  
1.3.1  Design Science  
A good starting point to design science in IS is provided by March and Smith (1995) . They define it as 
an attempt to create things that serve human purposes, as opposed to natural and social sciences, which 
try to understand reality  (Au 2001) . March and Smith outline a design science framework with two  
axes, namely research activities and research outputs (see  Figure 2). Research outputs cover  
constructs, models, methods and instantiations. Research activities comprise building, evaluating,  
theorizing on and justifying artifacts .  
The Business Model Ontology - a proposition in a design science approach  
5  
Figure 2: Design Science Research Framework (March and Smith 1995)  
Cons tructs  or concepts form the vocabulary of a domain. They constitute a conceptualization used to  
describe problems within a domain.  A model  is a set of propositions or statements expressing  
relationships among constructs. In design activities, models repres ent situations as problem and  
solution statements. A  method  is a set of steps (an algorithm or guideline) used to perform a task.  
Methods are based on a set of underlying constructs (language) and a representation (model) of the  
solution space. An  instanti ation is the realization of an artifact in its environment. Instantiations  
operationalize constructs, models and methods.  
Concerning research activities, March and Smith  (1995)  identify  build  and evaluate  as the two main  
issues in design science. Build refers to the const ruction of  constructs, models, methods and artifacts  
demonstrating that  they can be constructed. Evaluate refers to the development of criteria and the  
assessment of  the output's  performance against those criteria. Parallel to these two research activities  
in design science March and Smith add the natural and social science couple, which are theorize and  
justify. This refers to the construction of theories that explain how or why something happens. In the  
case of IT and IS research this is often an explanat ion of how or why an artifact works within its  
environment. Justify refers to theory proving and requires the gathering of scientific evidence that  
supports or refutes the theory (March and Smith 1995) .  
Summarized, constructs, models, methods and artifacts  are built to perform a specific task. These  
outputs  then become the object of study, which must be evaluated scientifically.  They  have to be  
evaluated  in order to conclude if any progress has been made. In order to do this, we have to develop  
metrics and measure the  outputs  according to those metrics.  For instance, when an artifact has been  
applied in a specific environment, it  is important to determine why and how the artifact worked or did  
not work. Such research applies natural science methods to artifacts (theorize ). Then, given a  
generalization or theory we must justify  that explanation. Evidence has to be gathered to test the theory 
in question. Justification for artefacts generally follows the natural science methodologies governing  
data collection and analysis.  
1.3.2  Research  Outline of the Dissertation  
The business model research in this dissertation is based on the design science framework detailed  
above and essentially covers the  build  and some  evaluate  research activities and has a research output  
of constructs , models  and instantiations . As stated earlier (see section  1.2), the first research  goal of  
this dissertation is to find an ontology (i.e. artifact or model) that makes it possible to  conceptually  
express the business logic of a firm  in a structured form . The second research goal consists in applying 
this model to one of its possible uses  (i.e. instantiation), from which we chose two.  Firstly,  the 
instantiation of the ontology in an IT tool that allows to capture business models  in a structured way   Build  Evaluate  Theorize  Justify  Constructs

Introduction  
6 and secondly,  IS & strategy alignment. In terms of March and Smith's research frameworks thi s means 
we will aim at finding the basic constructs of a business model and build and ontology that expresses  
the relationships among them. Subsequently, we have to evaluate the constructs and the model based  
on an adequate measurement system. The same two  steps of building and evaluating apply to the two  
instantiations that are based on the ontology (IS & strategy alignment and IT prototype).  
As illustrated in  Figure 2, March and Smith  (1995)  propose a four by four framework that produces  
sixteen cells describing viable research efforts. The different cells have different objectives with  
different appropriate research methods. A research project can cover multiple cells, but does not  
necessarily have to cover them all .  
Concerning the importance of  a specific design science research its relevance and contribution in the  
build activity are judged on the basis of novelty of the artifact and its persuasiveness of achieving the  
goals it claims. Research in the evaluate activity is based on the developmen t of metrics that allow to  
compare the performance of constructs, models, methods and instantiations for specific tasks.  
Evaluation of constructs tend to involve completeness, simplicity, elegance, understandability and ease 
of use.  
In Figure 3 we illustrate which cells at the intersection of research activities and research outputs of  
March and Smith's framework  (1995)  are covered by this thesis. Each cell/intersection contains a  
specific research objective of the overall business model research an d is addressed and explained in a  
specific chapter of the dissertation. The  build  column covers the quest for the basic concepts in  
business models (construct), the definition of a business model ontology (model) and the prototyping  
of an IT tool that asse sses business models, as well as  a proposition for  IS and strategy alignment  
(instantiation). The  evaluate  column includes  evaluating  the completeness of the concepts (construct),  
the appropriateness of the ontology (model) and the application of the proto type and  the IS and  
strategy alignment  proposition to a specific case (instantiation). The  theorize  and justify  columns and  
the according cells are not covered in this research, nevertheless they are addressed in the  evaluation 
and conclusion (see section s 7, 9).

7 1.3.3  Method Mix Applied to the Cells of the Design Science Framework  
In the previous section we explained the research objectives in the different cells of March and Smith's 
framework (1995)  covered by this dissertation. But as March and Smith explain, every cell and  
research objective may call for a different methodology. This  makes it necessary to identify an  
adequate method for each specific research objective, resulting in an overall method mix. To achieve  
this I analyzed a study on the methodologies applied in and accepted by seven leading MIS journals  
during a recent five year period  (Palvia, Mao et al. 2003) . The study outlines thirteen different  
methodologies that they also rank by their popularity. From the thirteen I retain seven that fit well with 
the research objectives (respectively cells) I have defined previously. These methods are  
specula tion/commentary, frameworks & conceptual models, library research, literature analysis, case  
study, interview and secondary data (see Table 1). Methodology  Definition  Speculation/commentary  Research that derives from thinly suppor ted arguments  
or opinions with little or no empirical evidence.  Frameworks and Conceptual Models  Research that intends to develop a framework or a  
conceptual model.  Library Research  Research that is based mainly on the review of existing  
literature.  Literature Analysis  Research that critiques, analyzes, and extends existing  
literature and attempts to build new groundwork, e.g., it 
includes meta analysis.  Case Study  Study of a single phenomenon (e.g., an application, a  
technology, a decision) in an organ ization over a logical 
time frame.  Interview  Research in which information is obtained by asking  
respondents questions directly. The questions may be  
loosely defined, and the responses may be open -ended.  Secondary Data  A study that utilizes existing orga nizational and  
business data, e.g., financial and accounting reports,  
archival data, published statistics, etc.  
Table 1: MIS Methodologies retained for this research (based on Palvia et al. (2003) ) 
Figure 4 illustrates which one of the retained methodologies I have applied to which cell and  
accordingly to which research objective. In the following lines I explain why I have chosen these  
methodologies and how they contribute to this research on business models.  
The category  speculation/commentary  refers to articles and research that are not really based on any  
hard evidence. They largely reflect the knowledge and experience of the authors. By definition, they  
tend to be somewhat visionary in nature. Typically, they  signal the arrival of new trends and directions 
in the technology, its management or application  (Palvia, Mao et al. 2003) . In this dissertation  
speculation/commentary  has triggered the initial research on business models as a method for formally  
representing the business logi c of a firm. It is somewhat visionary wanting to formalize business  
models in order to improve business and IS management and results will only occur after building and 
evaluating a model. Thus I use  speculation/commentary  as one of the contributors to bui ld constructs  
and models.  
Library research  (which is also part of most of the other methodologies) summarizes and synthesizes  
past research, and highlights some of the important conclusions. Literature analysis  goes a step further 
and examines many (perha ps all) past studies in a particular area and conducts a scientific meta  
analysis of the cumulative knowledge, in effect treating each study as one data point  (Palvia, Mao et  
al. 2003) . These two methodologies embody the basis for the design of the business model ontology.  
In order to build the ontology we rely on an extensive library and literature research on business  
model, managerial and to some extent ontology research .  
Introduction  
8 Palvia et al. define frameworks & conceptual models  as especially useful for a discipline that generally  
lacks and defies attempts to develop theory. They note that in lieu of theory, frameworks helped guide 
the work of many MIS researchers over the years. In this dissertation conceptual research in the form  
of the business model framework (i.e. business mod el ontology) is the heart of the research and  
follows March and Smith's  (1995)  design science principles of bu ilding and evaluating an artifact. In  
the case of this research the artifact takes the from of a conceptual model, a managerial application (IS 
and strategy alignment) and an IT prototype (an IT tool to seize business models).  
Lee (1989)  has been one of the first to  argue that  case study research  in MIS can have as much rigor  
as quantitative  research. A case study generally refers to the in depth study of a single phenomenon  
(e.g., one application, one technology) over time in a single organization  (Palvia, Mao et al. 2003) . In 
the case of this dissertation I use a case study that has a somewhat different function . It serves as a  
method to test and evaluate the validity of the constructs and the designed ontology, which is  
essentially based on interviews. Furthermore, the case study is applied to evaluate the instantiations of 
the ontology.  
Although interviews are  typically part of other methodologies, such as case studies and qualitative  
research, Palvia et al.  (2003)  list them as a separate category. The reason is that in their study they  
found this method repeatedly mentioned  – either by itself or in combination with  other methodologies  
– as the primary method of data collection. In this dissertation interviews are essentially used to  
evaluate the ontology by people that would use such a construct, like managers, consultants and  
academics.  
IS research based on secondar y data is  not in widespread practice, as in other business disciplines  
(e.g., in Finance where company financial performance data and stock  market data are analyzed  
frequently) (Palvia, Mao et al. 2003) . However, this dissertation uses secondary data, drawing from  
company websi tes, financial databases and publicized case studies, in order to illustrate parts of the  
ontology or to evaluate some of its constructs.

The dissertation does NOT aim at the following : 
• Modeling the whole enterp rise. The dissertation focuses on the business model, i.e. the logic  
of how an enterprise earns  money  - it does not aim at describing the entire enterprise . 
• Modeling and explaining business model success. The success of a business model relates not  
only to  its design but to its implementation which is not part of this dissertation.  
• Re-write strategy research.  By providing  a business model ontology that can help to describe  
how a company makes money  this dissertation  deals with  a new concept that yet has to  be 
integrated into strategy research  as proposed by Rentmeister and Klein (2003) .  
1.5 STRUCTURE OF THIS TH ESIS  
The dissertation is structured in nine parts:  
Chapter 1 presents the motivations of this research,  the research  methodology with  which the goals  
shall be achieved  and why this dissertation present  a contribution  to research .  
Chapter 2  investigates the origins,  the term and  the concept of business models . It defines what is  
meant by business models in this dissertation and how they are situated in the context of the firm. In  
addition this chapter o utlines the possible uses of the business model concept.  
Chapter 3 gives an overview of the research done in the field of business models and enterprise  
ontologies.  
Chapter 4 introduces the major contribution of this dissertation : the business model ontol ogy. In this  
part of the thesis the elements, attributes and relationships of the ontology are explained and described 
in detail.  
Chapter 5 presents a case study of the Montreux Jazz Festival which 's business model was captured by  
applying the structure and concepts of the  ontology. In fact, it gives an impression of how a business  
model description based on the ontology looks like.  
Chapter 6 shows an insta ntiation of the ontology into  a prototype tool: the Business Model Modelling  
Language BM2L. This is  an XML -based description language that allows to capture and describe the  
business model of a firm and has a large potential for further applications.  
Chapter 7 is about  the evaluation of  the business model ontology.  The evaluation builds on literature  
review, a set of interviews with practitioners and case studies.  
Chapter 8 gives an outlook on possible future research and applications of the  business model  
ontology. The main areas of interest are alignment of business and information technology  
IT/informa tion systems IS and business model comparison. Finally , chapter 9 presents  some  
conclusions.  
1.6  ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  
This is probably the nicest moment of my dissertation because I have the chance to thank all the  
people that have supported me and had to bear me during difficult moments. Though not essential to  
science this personal note is very important to me. I would like to name all, taking the risk of  
forgetting some and having to regroup others, but I am sure they will forgive me as they know that my 
heart  is with them when my memory sometimes lets me down.  
Introduction  
10 Of course my warmest thanks go to my mother, my father my sister, my grandmothers, Jean -Luc, 
Luca and Hanna for always believing in me even in difficult moments and for giving me days of rest  
in Winterth ur, St.Gallen, Davos, Montreal and Sarajevo.  
I am deeply indebted to my dissertation supervisor Prof Yves Pigneur without whom I would not have 
been able to write nor finish this dissertation. He has always, and I mean this literally, been available  
to look at my work when I was stuck and helped me to restructure my thoughts. For the time being it is 
a myth to me how somebody can grasp intellectual problems so quickly and give back a constructive  
input immediately.  
I express my gratitude to my dissertatio n jury composed of Profs Erkko Autio, Stefan Klein and  
Christopher L. Tucci for the discussions and inputs.  
Furthermore, I'm indebted to the "business model research community" for discussions, inputs,  
workshops and conferences, particularly to Profs Jaap  Gordijn, Harry Bouwman, Otto Petrovic and  
Christian Kittl, Patrick Stähler and Adamantia Pateli.  
I also want to thank all my friends and colleagues at the institute for the moments we have spent  
together: Ivan for the Saturdays spent working, Mathias for  the discussions on French thinker  
Bourdieu (and the pleasure and "burden" of having kids) and both for some memorable after -hour 
parties, my office colleagues, Sarra, Giovanni and Sandrine for listening to my "existential" problems, 
then there are all thos e that made the moments at the cafeteria more pleasant, notably Olivier, Yelena,  
Dominique, Bertrand, Antoine, Jan and Ian. I'm also grateful for the encouragements by Ethel Bonvin, 
Prof Christine Parent, the great discussions with Profs Thibault Estier an d Benoît Garbinato, the  
enthusiasm of Prof André -René Probst, the other Profs with whom I had a warm relationship, not  
forgetting the team of the Infocentre helping me out during those regular computer crashes.  
Of course I am also thankful for those outsi de of the academic microcosm that have stimulated  
intellectual thought and given me power to go on: Notably all the members of the Open World  
Initiative OWI for those amazing debates on global governance, development and trade, particularly  
Prof Jean -Pierr e Lehmann and the OWI members at the University of Lausanne and EPFL, namely  
Valérie (and all those "net sends"), Gerry, Minyue, Roch, Marc and Jacques. I certainly do not want to 
forget my friends in Lausanne and all over the world that made me cheer up when I had weaker  
moments: Thank you Bijou (for all the time we spent together), Maurice, Peter, Catherine, Aïcha,  
Ricci, Carla, Eva, Sandra (long live FUCP), Stéphane, Thierry & Nathalie, Alain & Corinne, Yves,

Cyprien, Edouard, Gladys, Aleks, Véronique and Vanessa. Also, a special thanks to Stefan who's  
exploits in professional sports (hope to see you there in Athens!) have been a particular motivation to  
me.  
Finally and most importantly, thank you Marliatu and Latif for stepping into my life.  
 
 
The Business Model Ontology - a proposition in a design science approach  
11 2 ORIGIN, DEFINITION, PLACE AND ROLE OF BU SINESS MODELS IN THE  FIRM  
We live in a competitive, rapidly changing and increasingly uncertain economic environment that  
makes business decisions complex and difficult. Companies are confronted with new information and  
communication technologies, shorter product life cycles, global markets and tougher competition. In  
this hostile business environment firms should be able to manage multiple distribution channels,  
complicated supply chains, expensive IT implementations, strategic partnerships and still stay flexible  
enough to react to market changes. Astonishingly, the concepts and software tools that help managers  
facilitate st rategic business decisions in this difficult environment are still scarce. Where are the tools  
that help managers easily explain what their business is and how exactly they should execute it, except 
maybe for simple text editors or simple charting tools? Where are the really useful tools that allow  
them to assess, understand, measure, change, communicate or even simulate their business models? Of 
course every manager and entrepreneur does have an intuitive understanding of how his business  
works and how val ue is created. In other words he does have an intuitive understanding of the  
company’s business model, but even though this business model influences all important decisions, in  
many cases she or he is rarely able to communicate it in a clear and simple wa y (Linder and Cantrell  
2000) . And how can one decide on a particular business issue  or change it, if it is not clearly  
understood by the parties involved? Therefore it would be interesting to think of a set of tools that  
would allow business people to understand what their business model is and of what essential  
elements it is composed of , tools that would let them easily communicate this model to others and that 
would let them change and play around with it in order to learn about business opportunities.  
In the following three subsections I first try to show that the business model conce pt has become  
popular because of a business environment shaped by ICT and globalization and characterized by an  
increasing complexity and uncertainty that leaves managers with difficult decisions to make. Then I  
explain what business models actually are an d how they can be situated in the company. Finally, in the 
last subsection I outline what they can be used for.  
2.1  TECHNOLOGY, E -BUSINESS, COMPLEXITY  AND UNCERTAINTY  
I argue that the business model concept has become popular because today's managers are spoi lt for  
choice when it comes to defining their value proposition, configuring their value network, choosing  
their partners, looking for ways to reach the customer and many other similar decisions. This has not  
always been the case and is essentially the out come of the interaction between increasingly rapid  
technological change and globalization (Archibugi and Iammarino 2002) . However, new technologies, 
globalization and the abundant reservoir of choices to configure a business makes managing an ever  
harder task (Zahra and O'Neill 1998) . Today's business landscape is characterized by the intense use of 
ICT (e.g. for e -business), fierce glob al competition, rapid change and results in increasing complexity, 
high risk and greater uncertainty than ever before.  Responding to these challenges described below I  
will later address how the business model concept can improve manageability of some of these issues 
in the sections 2.3 and 2.4.  
2.1.1  Technological Change, e -Business and New Business Models  
In the last decades  science and technology  have experienced an impressive advance. According to  
Hodgson (2003) this is inherent to capitalism. Competition pressures firms to pursue profits through  
two main means. Firstly, the conquest of new markets by geographical expansion and/or the  
introduction of new products, such as new technologies or skills. Secondly , by cutting costs through  
the adoption of new technologies and new skills (see  Figure 5). Hodgson explains that "in this quest  
for innovation, the frontiers of science and technology are advanced, leading to new fields of  
knowledg e and enquiry"  (Hodgson 2003, p.471) . Furthermore, he argues that because "services are  
generally more diverse than manufactured goods, diversity also increases with the increasing relative  
size of the service sector". And there is certainly no doubt that  the contribution of the service sector to  
GDP and employment has become more and more important (OECD 2001) .  
Origin, Definition, Place and Role of Business Models in the Firm  
12  
Figure 5: Competition and Technological Change  
As a glance at the statistics shows, investment  in ICT equipment and software has steadily grown over 
the last decades (OECD 2002) . At the same time the cost of ICT hardware, software and services have 
fallen drastically, while their performance has exploded. Of course this has had an important impact on 
companies of every size, as they increasingly adopt and rely on ICT. Particularly the rise of the  
Internet in the 1990s and the adoption of e-business an d e-commerce has drastically changed the way  
companies do business. As to definitions, e-commerce, or more properly electronic commerce, stands  
for the buying and selling of goods and services on the Internet, especially the World Wide Web. The  
more wider  term e-business, or more properly electronic business, simply stands for the conduct of  
business on the Internet. In contrast to e-commerce this is not only buying and selling but also  
servicing customers and collaborating with business partners. E-busines s can be understood as a  
powerful extension of the more traditional EDI that predates today's Internet and stands for the  
exchange of business data using an understood data format.  
As regards the effects of new ICTs, e-commerce and e-business, their impac t has been the  
multiplication of possible business configurations and thus choices to make for managers. In contrast  
to the traditional organization of an industry where business models looked alike, the range of possible 
new business models in the ICT era  have grown strongly. I argue that this increase in variety of  
business models is closely related to the adoption of ICTs in business.  
ICT's impact has been fourfold. Firstly, affordable ICTs have reduced transaction and coordination  
costs as defined in tr ansaction cost economics  (Coase 1937; Williamson 1975) . In other words, the 
costs of collaborating with partners (e.g. outsourcing) and integrating customers in the company's  
processes (e.g. customization, customer services) are not prohibitive anymore. This means that the  
traditionally isolated firm is shifting to new forms of  network organizations. Based on a literature  
review Andriani  (2001, p.261)  explains that "this transition reflects the widely acknowledged  
phenomenon of disintegration of traditionally integrated structures of business into more complex  
networks of independent parts". The consequences for management are a much larger choice of  
possible business configurations. Secondly, ICT, e-commerce and e-business have made it possible to  
offer completely new products and services of which many have an important information component  
and which are frequently provided in collaboration by multiple companies  (Evans and Wurster 1997) . 
Thirdly, ICTs have made it possible to reach customers in  new and innovative ways and through a  
multitude of channels. Also, the Internet has made it easier to conduct business on a global basis and  
theoretically reach and service customers at the remotest places of the planet. Finally, with the Internet 
and the  Web a range of new pricing and revenue mechanisms have found the way into business  
practice (Verma and Varma 2003) . 
The list of ICT's impacts on business could probably be extended, but the main thing to be retained  
from the above is that these evolutions bring an important increase in choices and decisions that  
managers face in ter ms of business models. This explains the growing research in business models in  
general and business models with a strong ICT component (e.g. e -business).  
2.1.2  Industry Clockspeed  
Charles Fine  (1998)  has coined the term industry clockspeed. He shows that different industries and  
segments of them have their own pace of change in the life cycles of their products, production  Weak Seller  Technological 
Change  innovation  
adoption  • New Markets

• Falling Cost of ICTs  
• Performance 
Explosion of ICTs  
• Globalization of 
Innovations  Market  
The Business Model Ontology - a proposition in a design science approach  
13 processes, structural makeup and CEO tenure. These "clockspeeds" are essentially driven by  
technological change and competition. The consequence is that positions of competitive advantage last 
only for a certain time and leading companies sometimes lose th is position because they do not or  
cannot adapt to change. Therefore, when change was slower, competitive advantage was longer -
lasting. But in today's world of rapid change managers have to find new ways of keeping up with  
faster industry clockspeed.  
A res earch on the electronics industry has shown that clockspeed is a driver of organizational change  
(Mendelson and Pillai 1999) . The authors of the research indicate how other industries are also  
experiencing increasing levels of business dynamics and they recommend learning from the  
electronics industry  which leads the way. The question is of course what management tools to use in  
order to cope with this increasing clockspeed.  Maybe  the business model concept  could help 
companies better adapt to change (see section  2.4.3 ). Tho ugh not focus of this dissertation, the  
question of rapid adaptation may be easier to answer on the basis of the contributions of this research.  
2.1.3  Complexity  
Another characteristic of today's business landscape is its complexity. According to Hodgson  (2003)  
capit alism naturally leads to more complexity driven by powerful economic forces. Under this he  
understands a growing diversity of interactions between human beings and between people and their  
technology (Hodgson 2003) . He also mentions  "new and varied organizational forms devised to 
increase productivity and to manage an exponentially expanding number of products and processes" as 
drivers of complexity  (Hodgson 2003, p.471) . Indeed, the decomposition of the integrated company  
and the formation of business networks as described abov e has contributed to complexity because it is  
a mechanism that generates diversity  (Andriani 2001) . The business model concept may be one of the  
tools that helps tackling at least some aspects of complexity by highlighting important issues and  
pointing out the relationships between them (see section 2.4.1  and 2.4.4 ). Like every conceptualization 
and model the business model concept aims at representing reality in a  structured, simplified and  
understandable way.  
2.1.4  Uncertainty  
It is widely accepted that one of the effects o f the communication technology revolution of the 1990s, 
coupled with the forces of globalisation and liberalisation, has been the increase in environmental risk  
and uncertainty that organisations have to face  (Andriani 2001) . As Wytenburg states "the greater the  
degree of complexity in an environment, the more var ious, dynamic, and unpredictable are those  
situations" (2001, p.118) . The problem with uncer tainty is that it increases the environmental risk that  
a company faces because the future becomes unpredictable. Referring to this Courtney, Kirkland et al. 
(1997)  speak of four levels of uncertainty that managers face (see  Theory Box  1). At the first level  
there is a single view of the future, at the second level one of several futures will occur, at the third  
level there is a range of possible futures and at the fourth level true ambiguity rules in regard to future. 
Managing uncertainty is probably one of th e most important challenges that managers face today.  
Providing a specification of the conceptualization of business models could eventually improve  
scenario approcaches and one day lead to simulation. This would help managers to be better prepared  
for the  future (see section 2.4.4 ).

14 2.2  WHAT ACTUALLY IS A BUSINESS MODEL  
In this section I outline my understanding of the expression and concept of  business models. This  
understanding is based on a careful literature review (see section  3.1), but may not be shared in detail  
by all the authors in business model research.  
As the term business model intuitively suggests it ha s something to do with business and it has  
something to do with models. A quick lookup in the online version of the Cambridge Learner's  
Dictionary (Cambridge 2003)  returns no result for the full combined term but the following definitions 
for the two separate terms:  
• business : the activity of buying and selling goods and services, or a particular company that  
does this, or work you do to earn money.  
• model : a representation of something, either as a physical object which is usually smaller than  
the real object, or as a simple des cription of the object which might be used in calculations.  
Related to the first definition it can be said that the term  business  in the expression business model  
relates to "the activity of  buying and selling goods and services"  and "earning money" . Relat ed to the  
second definition it can be said that the term model relates to "a representation of something as a  
simple description of the object which might be used in calculations". By combining the two we get a  
first simple understanding which is that a bu siness model is a representation of how a company buys  
and sells goods and services  and earns money .  
In general the  purpose of creating a model is to help understand, describe, or predict how things work  
in the real world by exploring a simplified represe ntation of a particular entity or phenomenon. Thus,  
in the case of a business model the model (i.e. representation) shall help understand, describe and  
predict the "activity of  buying and selling goods and services"  and "earning money"  of a particular  
comp any. But as the notion buying and selling seems to o narrow, I try to extend it. So differently put, 
the business model is an abstract representation of the business logic of a company. And under  
business logic I understand an abstract comprehension of the  way a company makes money, in other  
words, what it offers, to whom it offers this and how it can accomplish this.  
At this point it must be mentioned that some confusions exist concerning business models. The  
conceptual business model approach outlined in  this dissertation is very abstract and quite different  
from so -called "business modeling", which is process related and with which it is often confused. This 
confusion comes from research and industry where  the term business model is sometimes used for  
business process models (Gordijn, Akkermans et al. 2000) . However, in the domain of process models  
a multitude of tools an d concepts already exist, such as  UML activity diagrams or Petri nets. In  
contrast, little concepts and tools exist that help companies and their managers specify their more  
conceptual business model (i.e. their business logic) on a higher  level of abstrac tion.  
It must also be mentioned that there is an ongoing discussion on the difference between strategy and  
business models  (Stähler 2002; Seddon and Lewis 2003) . Currently, there are different points of view  
that differ widely. In this dissertation I will not address this discussion and simply look at a business  
model as the translation of  a company's strategy into a blueprint of the company's logic  of earning  
money. Putting strategy, business models and process models together one can say that they address  
similar problems (e.g. the one of earning money in a sustainable way) on different busin ess layers  (see 
Figure 6). In general, s uch a multi -layer approach is  quite common in IS.

The Business Model Ontology - a proposition in a design science approach  
15 For example Chandler  (Chandler 1962; 1990)  already themasized strategy and structure which would  
be typically located in the strategic layer. The business model layer would then translate these issues  
into the elemen ts and relationships of the money earning logic of a company's business model.  
Furthermore, there is a business model process going from design to implementation illustrated in  
Figure 7. The business model design translates a stra tegy into a business model blueprint. Then the  
business model has to be financed through internal or external funding (e.g. venture capital, cash flow, 
etc.). And finally it has to be implemented into an actual business enterprise.  
 
Figure 7: Business Model steps  
A last common but important confusion related to the concept of business models is that many  people 
speak about business models when they really only mean parts of a business model  (Linder and  
Cantrell 2000) . An online auction, for example, is not a business model, but a pricin g mechanism, and, 
as such, part of a business model (admittedly sometimes a dominant part of the business model).  
Similarly, an online community is not a business model in itself, but part of the customer relationship. 
Or take revenue sharing. This is not  a business model in itself either, but a way of exploiting  
partnerships to address the customer and distribute the resulting revenues. In my opinion a business  
model has to be understood as a much more holistic concept that embraces all such elements as pr icing 
mechanisms, customer relationships, partnering and revenue sharing.  
In a nutshell I describe a business model...:  
• as an abstract conceptual model that represents the  business and money earning  logic of  a 
company.  
• as a business  layer (acting as a sor t of glue) between business strategy and processes . 
But, the business model...:  
• is not a  guarantee for success as it has to be implemented and managed.   
• is something else than the company's business process model  (Gordijn, Akkermans et al.  
2000) . 
After having defined what a business model is in this dissertation and what it isn't, it is of course of  
interest to define what  belongs into a business model. This can be equated with the quest of defining a 
generic business model with all its elements and relationships. This will be subject of section  4 of this  
dissertation. Obviously, and as this domain of research is still quite young, there are differing opinions 
among business practitioners and academicians on what these elements and relationships are.  For the  
moment, until providing more details  in section  4, let me use the following working definition for  
business models:  
A business model is a conceptual tool that contains a set of elements and their relationships and  
allows expressing  a company's  logic  of earning money . It is a description of the value a company  
offers to one or several segments of customers and the architecture of the firm and its network of  
partners for creating, marketing and delivering this value and relationship capital, in order to  
generate profitable and sustainable reven ue streams.  
A last thing that must be considered when talking about business models is their type. Similar to  
Linder and Cantrell  (2000)  I distinguish between three different types. First, there is the abstract  
business model concept, which is a generic model of elements, components and relationships. Second  Design  
Business Model  Implement  
Business Model  Finance

Management defines and 
designs the right business

structure for the business model 
(e.g. internal funding, venture 
capital, stock market funding)  The business model is 
implemented into business 
structure, business 
processes and infrastructure 
Origin, Definition, Place and Role of Business Models in the Firm  
16 there are the  operating business models that are the implemented and existing business models of  
different companies. In other words, they represent an instance of the generic business model. Finally, 
there are the scenario business models that are only virtual, not exi sting as such in the real world. They 
can serve different ends like fostering innovation, simulating opportunities or acting as a guideline in  
change management. They represent a virtual instance of the generic business model.  
2.3  THE BUSINESS MODEL' S PLACE I N THE COMPANY  
In order to get a better understanding of the business model and its role, it is important to explain how 
it is situated in the company. As mentioned in the previous section the business model is a  
conceptualization  of the  money earning  logic  of a firm. As such it can function as a conceptual link,  
forming a triangle between strategy, business organization and ICT (see  Figure 8). Because there is  
often quite a substantial understanding gap between these  three “worlds”, the business model concept  
could serve as a federator  or glue .  
As illustrated in  Figure 8, business strategy, business organization and ICT look at the firm from  
different angles and  on different business layers. These categories also often regroup different groups  
of employees with different preoccupations and worldviews. Business  people position the company in 
the market define  the direction and formulate objectives and goals, whereas business pro cess and ICT 
designers have to understand and implement these visions into something more concrete. In order to  
guarantee a smooth  implementation of business visions  and alignment between the different groups , 
firms require a very clear communication of co ncepts and understandings between the implicated  
parties. This is where  conceptually  defined business models come into play. By using an ontological  
approach to business modeling, one can create a shared and common understanding of  what a  
company does to earn money  and facilitate communication between people and heterogeneous and  
widely spread application systems (Fensel 2001) .  
The triangle  and  the business model  are subject to  continuous  external forces  (Figure 8). Among 
others these forces include  competition, legal, social or technological change and changes in customer  
demand. It is  the manager's role to design or adapt a company’s business model by responding to these 
external forces.  
 
Figure 8: Environment, Business Models, Strategy, Process and Information Systems  
2.3.1  Strategy and Business Models  
The first element in the triangle described  above  is business strategy. Mintzberg and Lampel  (1999)  
describe strategy as an elephant of wh ich we can only grab hold of some part or other. This is a nice  
metaphor for the fact that business strategy is an enormous domain in which little consensus exists and 
a variety of schools reign.  Different views include  that strategy is about providing a company vision,  
designing an organization that achieves a fit between internal strengths and weaknesses and external  
threats and opportunities  (Learned, Christensen et al. 1965) , positioning the company in the market  
(Porter 1985) , defining a set of goals and objectives  (Drucker 1954; Kaplan and Norton 1992) , the Business

The Business Model Ontology - a proposition in a design science approach  
17 steps to achieve them and the way to measure them (Kaplan and Norton 1992) .  
In this dissertation I argue that the business model  and strategy talk about similar issues but on a  
different business layer. I understand the business mo del as the  strategy's implementation into  a 
conceptual blueprint of the company's money earning  logic. In other words the vision of the company  
and its strategy  are translated into value propositions, customer relations and value networks (see  
Figure 9).  
 
Figure 9: Business Strategy and Business Model  
2.3.2 Business Organization and Business Models  
The second element of the triangle surrounding business models is the organizational sid e. Similarly to 
strategy and business model layer the business organization  layer talks about similar issues  (e.g.  
structure)  but addresses them from a different angle . The business organization is about the "material" 
form the conceptual business model ta kes in the world, such as departments, units and workflows (see 
Figure 10). This is not to be confused with the business model, which illustrates a company's  money 
earning  logic  as a set of concepts . Yet, the business organization  and business model are closely  
interrelated (see Illustration Box 1). 
 
Illustration Box 1: Business Organization and Business Model at Compaq  
Changes in the business mo del bring up organizational questions, which is illustrated by the fact that  
companies didn't really know how to structurally cope with their new online outlets in the 90s. When a 
large number of companies started selling over the Internet they used differ ent organizational  
approaches regarding their new online channels. Some created entirely new departments, others put  
their existing IT department in charge and yet others created completely new companies in which they  
had a majority stake.  
 
Figure 10: Business Organization and Business Model  Compaq vs. Dell  The then dominating computer manufacturer Compaq (now HP) came under pressure by Dell  in the 90s, when this competitor was extremely successful with its direct -to-customer approach  that heavily relies on the Internet. Compaq was forced to rethink its strategy because it was constantly losing ground in the PC market. As an apparently logic consequence  Compaq introduced its own direct Internet distribution channel on the Internet into its  business model. However, the company forgot to align this new business model with its  business organization. The outcome was a hostile reaction from its resellers, who said that  Compaq was competing with them.

18 Furthermore, a good understanding of the infrastructure side of a business model leads to an optimized 
business organization. By precisely defining infrastructural aspects of a business models, such as the  
supply chain and the various partnerships and links a company maintains it becomes much easier to  
address questions related to processes or, for example, business process outsourcing (BPO).  
2.3.3  ICT and Business Models  
The last element in the triangle is technology, or more precisely ICT. Under ICT I understand all the  
information and communication technology used in the company. This includes hardware, such as  
PCs, servers, PDAs and mobile phone as well as software and  tools, such as Websites, customer  
relationship management applications, management information systems and so on. The link between  
ICT and business models is particularly strong, since ICT has been a strong enabler for a variety of  
innovative business mode ls (cf. section 2.1).  
 
Illustration Box 2: Relying on ICT  
Sometimes the link between ICT and business model is evident as in the case of online companies  
such as Amazon.com or eBay (see  Illustration Box  2). However, the link between technology and  
business model does not have to be so obvious. When communication and coordination costs  
dramatically decreased because of shrinking ICT costs, th is had an enormous indirect impact on  
business models. It became much easier for companies to work in networks and offer joint or  
complementary value propositions. Also, companies increasingly included informational aspects or  
even ICT enriched components into their products and services.  
In general, technology people should ask themselves how ICT can contribute to improving a  
company's business model. And the other way around, business people should ask themselves what  
technological consequences a change i n the business model could have (see Figure 11). 
 
Figure 11: ICT and Business Model  
2.3.4  Environment and Business Model  
Besides relating to the elements in the triangle a company's business model is continuously subject to  
external pressures that oblige a company to constantly adapt their business model to a changing  
environment. In this section I list some of these pressures that directly or indirectly influence a  
business model. Nam ely, these are technological change, competitive forces, change in customer  
demand and change in the social or legal environment.  
Technological change . As shown in section  2.1 on technology and change, technology (e.g. ICT) and  
its application in business is rapidly changing. And since technology is increasingly applied to every  
aspect of business, technological change pressures managers to reflect on how technology can be  
adopted to improve the business logic of the firm. With the rise of the Internet companies started  Relying on ICT: Amazon.com and eBay  
The most extreme examples of the relations hip between ICT and business model are web -based companies like Amazon.com or eBay. They have business models that rely to a great  deal on ICT and specifically the Internet. Besides the most evident dependencies on websites  and servers they also improve their business model through a number of customer related  applications, like personalized recommendations or rankings.

The Business Model Ontology - a proposition in a design science approach  
19 adopting new web -based channels. Some even tried to figure out how their products could be entirely  
digitized or at least "digitally enhanced". Also, fallin g communication and coordination costs due to  
cheaper technology have forced companies to become more efficient. They started to outsource all  
non-essential business and progressively rely on partnerships. I think it is no understatement to say  
that techno logical change is a major force of business model change. In some cases technological  
change may even challenge the mere existence of a particular business model.  
Competitive forces . A second -major pressure on a company's business model comes from its  
competitors. I have already discussed the example of Compaq and Dell that competed for customers  
with two different business models in the PC -industry. For traditional industry players adapting to  
changes in the competitive environment is especially crucial when new dynamic competitors rapidly  
dispute their market position as an incumbent (cf. Christensen  1997; Christensen 2003) . 
Customer demand . Pressure to adapt a company's business model may also come from the customer  
demand side. Changes in consumption patterns, revenue increases and "fashion changes" are just some 
of the possibilities I want to ment ion. The shift from fixed -line to mobile telephony is a nice example  
of change in customer demand.  
Social environment . Sometimes the social environment and social mood can influence the business  
model of a firm. This kind of pressure is particularly studi ed in stakeholder theory  (Friedman and  
Miles 2002) . For instance, if a company's business model is centered around low cost production in  
developing countries it might draw th e attention of militant non -governmental organizations that could 
mobilize public opinion against the firm. This happened to Nike regarding the ethics of its operations  
in Vietnam  (Kahle, Boush et al. 2000) . Besides ethics, changes in the social environment will also  
have an indirect influence on customer demand. This is the case for technology adoption, where the  
use and social acceptance of a specific technology by a broad majority opens up completely new  
markets and customer demands (Moore 1999) . 
Legal environment . Often changes in the legal environment also make it necessary to adapt business  
models. The introduction of new privacy laws can make the use of some business models illegal, if a  
company has extensivel y relied on customer information without the customer's explicit accordance.  
Anti-spamming laws may (hopefully) wipe -out business models based on sending out large trunks of  
unsolicited mails. Regulating advertisement over mobile phones may limit the range  of possible  
business models in m-commerce. New taxes may make a company's value proposition too costly and  
thus uninteresting for the customer. In general it can be said that the legal environment has a large  
influence on business models.  
2.4  USE OF BUSINESS  MODELS  
Business model research is a rather young research domain and still has to prove its relevance. But as  
addressed above, yet relatively little concepts and tools exist to help managers capture, understand,  
communicate, design, analyze and change the  business logic of their firm. In my opinion and the  
opinion of many other researchers in this domain the business model concept can fill some of this gap 
and can eventually gain an important position in managing under uncertainty.  
In the following sectio ns I will outline some of the roles the business model concept (i.e. the use of  a 
specification of a conceptualization of  business models) can play in business management, and,  
particularly in regard to e-business issues. I have identified five categories  of functions, which are  
understanding & sharing, analyzing, managing, prospects and patenting of business models.  
Furthermore, an ontological approach to business models is indispensable for building software based  
tools that help fulfill these five functi ons.  
I describe these categories to give an outlook on what could be done with the help of the business  
model concept, particularly on the base of the business model ontology. The scope of this dissertation, 
however, is the design of a business model onto logy. The possible roles of the business model concept 
will not be further  specified beyo nd this outlook  except for the propositions  on further research  in 
section 8.  
Origin, Definition, Place and Role of Business Models in the Firm  
20 2.4.1  Understand and Share  
The first area in which business models can contribute is in understanding and sharing the business  
logic of a firm. Concretely, business models help to capture, visualize, understand, communicate and  
share the business logic.  
Capture . As explained earlier, the business model of a company is a simplified representation of its  
business logic. However, as such business models exist only as abstract concepts or mental models in  
the head of people reasoning on them. Yet, experience shows that in many cases these people are not  
always capable of communicating this business model in a clear way  (Linder and Cantrell 2000) . 
Furthermore, because people have different mental models they will not automatically understand the  
same thing under a business model. Thus, a generic framework (i.e. an ontology) for describing  
busin ess models becomes necessary. Such a framework can be understood as a common language  
between stakeholders to get the ideas out of their heads in order to formulate them in a way that  
everybody understands.  
Visualize . Human's ability to successfully proce ss complex  information is quite limited. As can be 
shown  theoretically and empirically, processing information through the  visual system can  
substantially increase the degree to which complexity can be handled  successfully (Rode 2000) . Using 
an ontology to capture business models, means that with little additional effort they can be presented 
graphically (Gordijn and Akkermans 2003) .  
Understand . Nowadays business models are increasingly complex, particularly those with a strong  
ICT and e-business component. The relationship between the different elements of a business model  
and the decisive success factors are not always immediately observable. Therefore the process of  
modeling social systems and in this case business models help identifying and understanding the  
relevant elements in  a specific domain and the relationships between them  (Morecroft 1994; Ushold  
and King 1995) . In addition, the visual representation of a business model can dramatically enhance  
understanding.  
Communicate and sha re. I have already made a point that the business model concept helps capturing, 
understanding and visualizing the business logic of company. Being able to communicate and share  
this understanding with other stakeholders is simply a logical consequence of  the foregoing.  
Formalizing business models and expressing them in a more tangible way clearly help managers to  
communicate and share their understanding of a business among other stakeholders (Fensel 2001) . 
2.4.2  Analyze  
The second area in which the business model concept can contribute is in analyzing the business logic  
of a company. Concretely, they can improve measuring, observi ng and comparing the business logic  
of a company.  
Measure . Having captured the business model in a first step it may become easier to identify the  
relevant measures to follow in order to improve management. Similar to the Balanced Scorecard  
Approach (Kaplan and Norton 1992)  a business model shows which areas to monitor in a particular  
business. This is all the more relevant since in e-business the indicators to foll ow are still an issue of  
debate.  
Observe . The business logic of a company constantly changes due to inside and outside pressures, as  
shown in section  2.3.4 . Therefore a structured approach to business models is important in order to  
understand which particular issues have changed over time.  
Compare . Similar to observing a company's business model over time, a structured approach allows  
companies to compare their business model to the ones of their competitors. This is based on the  
reasoning that things are only comparable if they are seized and understood in the same way. Also,  
comparing one's business model to the one of a company in a completely dif ferent industry may help  
gaining new insights and foster business model innovation. Related to e-business and to dynamic  
industries this can help incumbents understand how aggressive new competitors and startups work.  
The Business Model Ontology - a proposition in a design science approach  
21 2.4.3  Manage  
The third area of contributio n of business models is in improving the management of the business  
logic of the firm. The business model concept helps ameliorating the design, planning, changing and  
implementation of business models. Additionally, with a business model approach companie s can  
react faster to changes in the business environment. Finally, the business model concept improves the  
alignment of strategy, business organization and technology.  
Design . Designing a coherent business model where all the elements are mutually reinfo rcing or at  
least optimized is not an easy task. Nowadays business models are quite complex and their success is  
often based on the interaction of a number of apparently minor elements. This is even more the case  
since e -business increases the range of ima ginable business models. Having a business model ontology 
at hand that describes the essential building blocks and their relationships will make it easier for  
managers to design a sustainable business model.  
Plan, Change & Implement . When a company decides  to adopt a new business model or to change an  
existing one, capturing and visualizing this model will improve planning, change and implementation  
(see Figure 12). It is much easier to go from one point to an other, when one can ex actly understand,  
say and show what elements will change. In this regard, Linder and Cantrell  (Linder and Cantrell  
2000)  speak of so -called change models that are the core logic for how a firm will change over time to 
remain profitable in a dynamic environment.  
 
Figure 12: Planning, Cha nging and Implementing Business Models  
React . Once a business model has been captured, mapped and understood by managers the foundations 
for improving speed and appropriateness of reaction to external pressures have been created.  
According to Petrovic and  Kittl (2001) , business model designers can easily modify certain elements  
of an existing business model. This is without doubt essential in an uncertain and rapidly changing  
competitive landscape.  
Align. I have already argued earlier that the business model concept can serve as a federator between  
the triangle of business strategy, business organization and technology. In other words, the business  
model forms a sort of conceptual bridge that makes it ea sier to align these three.  Chesbrough and  
Rosenbloom (2000) , for example, see business models as a mediating construct between technology  
and economic value.  
Improve decision -making . Having claimed that the business model concept enhances understanding  
and communicating the business logic of the firm I deduce that decision makers make more informed,  
and hence, better decisions. Asides from this, business models are a new unit of analysis  (Stähler 
2002)  that can be observed and compared, help defin ing measures and should therefore also improve  
decisions.  
2.4.4  Prospect  
A fourth area of contribution of business models refers to the possible futures of a company. I believe  
that the business model concept can help foster innovation and increase readiness fo r the future  
through business model portfolios and simulation.  Business  Model New Business  Model Time  
tfuture t0 
The management analyzes the current business 
model's adequacy to environmental pressures and 
designs a new business model if necessary  The new business model becomes a  
goal to achieve and guides planning, 
change and implementation  plan, change,  
implement  
Origin, Definition, Place and Role of Business Models in the Firm  
22 Innovate . Similar to the argument of improving change and increasing reaction capacities in the firm, I 
believe that a  conceptual  and modular business model approach can foster innovation. In  fact, 
specifying a set of business model elements and building blocks, as well as their relationships to each  
other, is like giving a business model designer a box of Lego stones. He can play around with these  
stones and create completely new business mode ls, limited only be his imagination and the pieces  
supplied. Amit and Zott (2001)  expl icitly perceive the business model as a locus of innovation.  
Business model portfolio . Based on Allen's law of excess of diversity in evolutionary theory  (Allen 
2001)  one may argue that it could be interesting for a company to maintain a portfolio of business  
models in order to be ready for the future. The idea behind Allen's law is that a sustainable and  
successful evol utionary strategy requires an amount of internal diversity superior to that of the  
environment. Allen suggests that agents need to have a stock of potential strategies to be set off in the  
face of unpredictability in environmental change (Andriani 2001) . In the case of a company this would 
mean having a stock of b usiness models in order to cope with change.  
Simulate and test . Simulating and testing business models is obviously the dream of every manager.  
Though simulation will never be able to predict the future, it is a way of doing risk free experiments,  
without  endangering an organization  (Sterman 2000) . By simulating and testing possible business  
models, managers will be better prepared for  the future. Similarly, in the domain of e-business 
Richards and Morrison  (2001)  compare this kind of simulation tool to a sort of flight simulator that  
allows building better e -business strategies.  
2.4.5  Patenting  
Increasingly entrepreneurs and companies in e-business seek to patent e-business processes and even  
entire aspects of t heir business model. Therefore business modeling may potentially have an important 
role to play in this legal domain. For example,  Priceline based much of its business strategy on a  
patent whose technology matches bids from buyers with interested sellers on the Net  (Angwin 2000) . 
Consequently, patenting of e-business methods has also started to create a number of legal battles. A  
famous one is the case between the online retailer  Amazon.com and the online arm of the bookseller  
Barnes & Noble (B&N). Amazon.com, who received a patent for its "one -click" ordering system  
attacked B&N for patent infringement, supposedly caused by its "express lane" checkout system on  
the B&N website  (Lesavich 2001) . It remains to be seen in what direction patenting business models  
and business processes moves.  
2.5  BUSINESS MODEL ONTO LOGY AND BUSINESS MO DEL TOOLS  
A last but fundamental ar ea of contribution of business models is in building the foundation for a set  
of new computer -assisted management tools. Management literature is famous for producing concepts 
and models. Yet, little of these concepts have been translated into software -based tools, although, in  
my opinion this could bring enormous value to management. For instance, some of the business model 
functions mentioned above principally make sense in a digitized version. Visualizing, designing and  
comparing business models can be done quickly, once software -based tools have been developed.  
More complex tasks, such as simulation are simply impossible without the help of computers.  
But in order to be able to use computer assistance as outlined above, an ontology of the business  
model  domain has to be provided. And this is exactly one of the aims of this dissertation (see section  
1.2). Once the elements and relationships of the business model concept have been defined one can  
start building a set of softwar e-based tools to simplify the life of managers.  
The Business Model Ontology - a proposition in a design science approach  
23 3 KNOWLEDGE OF THE PRO BLEM DOMAIN  
The two main domains that serve as a foundation for this thesis are management theory and  
Information Systems. More precisely, the first part of the dissertation treating of the business model  
ontology (section  4) is built on inputs from business model literature in management theory and  
enterprise ontologies in IS. The part of the dissertation treating of business strategy, IS alignment and  
e-business essentially draws from al ignment theory in IS (section  8.1).  
3.1  BUSINESS MODEL LITE RATURE  
In this section I explore the existing business model literature. The material treating of business  
models ranges from business model definitions, components, taxo nomies, design tools, change  
methodologies to evaluation measures.  
Surprisingly, the mainstream appearance of the term business model is a relatively young phenomenon 
that has found its  first peak during the Internet hype at the beginning of this millenni um. A query in  
Business Source Premier, a leading electronic database for business magazines and scholarly business  
journals, shows that the term appeared in 1960 in the title and the abstract of a paper in the Accounting 
Review (Jones 1960) . But as  Figure 13 shows, the boom of the expression business model has taken  
place in the 1990s with 144 occurrences in abstracts and 29 appearances in the title of peer -reviewed 
articles in the year 2003 in the Business Source Premier database of scholarly business  journals (see  
also (Stähler 2002) ). The term is found in numerous variations, such as “new business models”, “e -
business models” or “internet busine ss models”. However, it can be said that the expression was  
inflated through journalists, business people and academics that used it in relationship with e-
commerce, start -up companies and high tech companies. It seems that the executives, reporters, and  
analysts who used the term “business model” never really had a clear idea of what it meant. They  
sprinkled it into their rhetoric to describe everything from how a company earns revenue to how it  
structures its organization  (Linder and Cantrell 2000) . An interview with the CEO of a small Internet  
startup confirmed this impression: “I’m hap py that somebody is trying to define the term business  
model. It was one of the most violated terms. Everything was a business model. Everybody asked me  
what a business model is. I could never really define it. It is good that somebody is looking at this ” (cf. 
section  7.2).  
 
Figure 13: Occurrences of the term business model  
So the first step to this dissertation was a thorough review of the existing literature on business  
models. Therefore, in the following section s I analyze how the concept of business models has been  
defined in literature, how business models have been classified, what components they are composed  
of and what modelling efforts have been put into business modelling. Further, I analyze the literatur e 
that mentions business models as a business design tool, as a change methodology and as a means to  
evaluate and measure.  For facilitation I use the term business model interchangeably with the different 
expressions used by the different authors. I assume  that the "e" in e-business model is a temporary

Table 2: Business model authors list (partially based on (Pateli 2002) ) 
Table 2 summarizes the contributions of the most important business model authors. The  first two  
columns of the table name author and year of contribution and the following columns reveal the major  
business model areas covered and whether a specific author has contributed to this area. The first  
"definition" column shows if an author provid es a short comprehensible definition of what a business  
model is. The "taxonomy" column indicates which authors propose a classification of business models. 
The "components" column points out authors that go beyond a simple definition and classification of  
business models by presenting a conceptual approach to business models, proposing a set of business  
model components. Simply put, they specify of what a business model is composed of. The  
"representation tool" column specifies authors that offer a set of  tools or graphical representations to  
design business models. The "ontological modelling" column indicates authors that use a rigorous  
modelling approach to business models. Authors present in this category provide an ontology that  
carefully defines busine ss model concepts, components and relationships among components. The  
"change methodology" column points to authors including a time and change component in their  
business model concepts. Finally, the "evaluation measures" column indicates authors that try  to 
define indicators to measure the success of business models.  
The Business Model Ontology - a proposition in a design science approach  
25 3.1.1  Business Model Definitions  
The first column of  Table 2 covers business model definitions.  Paul Timmers, then working for the  
European Commission, was one of the fir st to explicitly define and classify business models (Timmers 
1998) . He understands a business model as the architecture  for the product, service and information  
flows, including a description of the various business actors and their roles and a description of the  
potential benefits for the various business  actors and a description of the sources of revenues. In order  
to understand how a company realizes its business mission he adds a marketing model that is the  
combination of the business model and the marketing strategy of the business actor under  
consider ation. Like Timmers, Weill and Vitale  (Weill and Vitale 2001)  define a business model as a  
description of the roles and relationships among a firm’s consumers, customers, allies and suppliers  
and it identifies the major flows of product, information, and money, as well as the major benefits to  
participants.  
In their  business model definition Linder and Cantrell (2000)  from the Accen ture Institute for Strategic 
Change differentiate between three different types of models: the components of a business model,  
real operating business models and change models. They define a business model as an organization’s  
core logic for creating value . Similarly, Petrovic, Kittl et al.  (2001)  perceive business models as the  
logic of a business system for creating value. They specify that this is in opposition to a description of  
a complex social sy stem itself with all its actors, relations and processes.  Referring to this Gordijn,  
Akkermans et al. (2000) mention that  in research as well as in industry practice, often business models 
are wrongly understood as business process models, and so can be specified using UML activity  
diagrams or Petri nets. They explain that this is a misunderstanding and tha t a business model is not  
about processes but about value exchanged between actors. In their opinion the failure to make this  
separation leads to poor business decision -making and inadequate business requirements.  
Like Petrovic, Kittl et al.  (2001)  Applegate (2001)  perceives a business model as a description of a  
complex business that enables the study of its structure, of the relationships among structural elements, 
and of how it will respond to the real world. In this regard Stähler  (2002)  reminds that  a model is  
always a simplification of the complex reality. It helps to understand th e fundamentals of a business or 
to plan how a future business should look like. Magretta  (2002)  adds that a  business model is like a  
story that explains how an enterprise works. And like Stähler she distinguishes the concept of business 
models from the concept of strategy. She explains that business models describe, as a system, how the 
pieces of a business fit together, but as opposed to strategy do not include performance and  
competition.  
Tapscott, Ticoll et al.  (2000)  do not directly define business models, but what th ey call b-webs 
(business webs).  A b-web is a business on the internet and represents a distinct system of suppliers,  
distributors, commerce service providers, infrastructure providers, and customers that use the Internet  
for their primary business communic ation and transactions. Similarly, another  highly network -
centered approach is provided by Amit and Zott  (2001) . They describe a business model as the  
architectural configuration of the components of transactions designed to exploit business  
opportunities. Their framework depicts the ways in which transactions are enabled by a network of  
firms, suppliers, complementors and customers.  
A series of authors introduce a financial element into their definitions.  Afuah and Tucci  (2003 ) state  
that each firm that exploits the Internet should have an Internet business model. They understand it as  
a set of Internet - and non -Internet -related activities that allow a firm to make money in a sustainable  
way. Hawkins  (2001)  describes a business  model as the commercial relationship between a business  
enterprise and the products and/or services it provides in the market. He explains that it is a way of  
structuring various cost and revenue streams such that a business becomes viable, usually in the  sense  
of being able to sustain itself on the basis of income it generates. Rappa  (2001)  defines a business  
model as the method of doing business by which a company can sustain itself  -- that is, generate  
revenue. For him the business model spells -out how a company makes money by specifying where it  
is pos itioned in the value chain.

26 3.1.2  Business Model Taxonomies  
Apart from definitions a number of authors provide us with business model taxonomies. This means  
that they classify business models with a certain number of common characteristics in a set of different  
categories. The probably best known classification scheme and definition of electronic business  
models is the one of Timmers (1998) . He distinguishes between eleven generic e -business models and  
classifies them according to their degree of innovation and their functional integration (see Figure 14). 
The models are e-shops, e-procurement, e-malls, e-auctions, virtual communities, collaboration  
platforms, third -party marketplaces, value chain integrators, value -chain service providers, information 
brokerage and trust a nd other third -party services (see Table 3). 
 
Figure 14: Figure: Timmer’s (1998)  classification scheme  Category  Description  
e-Shops  Stands for the Web marketing and promotion of a company or a shop and 
increasing ly includes the possibility to order and to pay.  
e-Procurement  Describes electronic tendering and procurement of goods and services.  
e-Malls  Stands for the electronic implementation of the bidding mechanism also known 
from traditional auctions.  
e-Auctio ns Consists of a collection of e -shops, usually enhanced by a common umbrella, for 
example a well -known brand.  
Virtual communities  This model brings together virtual communities that contribute value in a basic 
environment provided by the virtual communit y operator. Membership fees and 
advertising generate revenues. It can also be found as an add -on to other 
marketing operations for customer feedback or loyalty building.  
Collaboration 
platforms  Companies of this group provide a set of tools and informatio n environment for 
collaboration between enterprises.  
Third -party 
marketplaces  A model that is suitable when a company wishes to leave the Web marketing to 
a 3rd party (possibly as an add -on to their other channels). Third -party 
marketplaces offer a user i nterface to the supplier's product catalogue.  
Value chain 
integrators  Represents the companies that focus on integrating multiple steps of the value 
chain, with the potential to exploit the information flow between those steps as 
further added value.  
Value-chain service 
providers  Stands for companies that specialize on a specific function for the value chain, 
such as electronic payment or logistics.  
Information 
brokerage  Embraces a whole range of new information services that are emerging to add 
value to  the huge amounts of data available on the open networks or coming 
from integrated business operations.  
Trust and other Stands for trust services, such as certification authorities and electronic notaries E-Shop  E-Procurement  E-Mall

Table 3: Timmer’s architectures of business models (Timmers 1998)  
Alt and Zimmermann  (2001)  point out that there are two major categories of business models, one  
based on the object of the business model and the other based on the purpose of the business model.  
The first group includes market and role models, sector and industry models and finally revenue  
models. The second group includes business models, reference models and simulation models.  
Tapscott et al.  (2000)  proposes a network - and value -centered taxonomy that distinguishes between  
five types of value networks, which differ in their degree of economic control and value integration  
(see Figure 15 and Table 4). They call these types b -webs (business webs). The first one, the so -called 
Agora facilitates exchange between buyers and sellers, who jointly discover a price through on -the-
spot negotiations (e.g. eBay). In the second type, the Aggregation b-web, one company leads in  
hierarchical fashion, positioning itself as a value -adding intermediary between producers and  
customers (e.g. Amazon.com). In the third b-web, the Value Chain, a context provider structures and  
directs the network to produce highly int egrated value propositions (e.g. Dell). The fourth network, the 
Alliance, strives for high value integration without hierarchical control (e.g. Linux). The last type,  
Distributive Networks, keeps the economy alive and mobile (e.g. FedEx).  
 
Figure 15: b-webs (Tapscott, Ticoll et al. 2000)  Type of b -web Description  
Agora  Applies to markets where buyers and sellers meet to freely negotiate and 
assign value to goods. An Agora facilitates exchange between buyers and 
sellers, who jointly "discover" a price. Because sellers may offer a wide and 
often unpredictable variety or quantity of goods, value integration is low.  
Aggregation  In Aggregation b -webs there is a leader that takes responsibility for selecting 
products and s ervices, targeting market segments, setting prices, and ensuring 
fulfillment. This leader typically sets prices in advance and offers a diverse 
variety of products and services, with zero to limited value integration.  
Value Chain  In a Value Chain, the so -called context provider structures and directs a b -web 
network to produce a highly integrated value proposition. The seller has the 
final say in pricing.  
Alliance  An Alliance strives for high value integration without hierarchical control. Its 
participan ts design goods or services, create knowledge, or simply produces 
dynamic, shared experiences. Alliances typically depend on rules and 
standards that govern interaction, acceptable participant behavior, and the 
determination of value.  
Distributive Network  Distributive Networks are b -webs that keep the economy alive and mobile. 
They play a vital role in ensuring the healthy balance of the systems that they 
support. Distributive Networks service the other types of b -webs by allocating 
and delivering goods.

Table 5: Linder and Cantr ell’s (2000)  categorization of business models  
Weill and Vitale  (2001)  describe eight so -called atomic business models. Each model describes a  
different way of conducting business electronically.  They describe these atomic e-business models as  
the basic building blocks of an e -business initiative (see Table 6).  Atomic Business Model  Descript ion 
Content Provider  Content providers are firms that create and provide content (information, 
products, or services) in digital form to customers via third parties.  
Direct to Customer  In this model, the buyer and seller interact directly often bypassing  traditional 
channel members.  
Full-Service Provider  Firms in this category provide total coverage of customer needs in a particular 
domain, consolidated via a single point of contact. Domains cover any area 
where customer needs cover multiple products and  services, such as financial 
services or health care.  
Intermediary  The intermediary links multiple buyers and sellers. Usually the sellers pay the 
intermediary listing fees and selling commissions and it is possible that the 
buyer may also pay a purchase  or membership fee. Advertisers also provide 
revenue for intermediaries. There are six major classes of intermediaries, 
namely electronic mall, shopping agents, specialty auctions, portals, electronic 
auctions and electronic markets.  
Shared Infrastructur e In this atomic business model a firm provides infrastructure shared by its 
owners. The shared infrastructure generally offers a service that is not already 
available in the marketplace, and it may also be a defensive move to thwart 
potential domination b y another major player.  
Value net Integrator  The value net integrator coordinates product flows from suppliers to allies and 
customers. He strives to own the customer relationship with the other 
participants in the model, thus knowing more about their op erations than any 
other player. His main role is coordinating the value chain.  
Virtual Community  In this model the firm is in the center, positioned between members of the 
community and suppliers. Fundamental to the success of this model is that 
members a re able to communicate with each other directly.  
Whole -of-
Enterprise/Government  The single point of contact for the e -business customer is the essence of the 
whole -of-enterprise atomic business model. This model plays an important 
The Business Model Ontology - a proposition in a design science approach  
29 role in public -sector or ganizations but also applies to the private sector.   
Table 6: Weill and Vitale’s (2001)  atomic business models  
For Rappa (2001)  a business model spells -out how a company makes money by specifying where it is  
positioned in the value chain.  His classification scheme consists of nine generic forms of e-business 
models, which ar e Brokerage, Advertising, Infomediary, Merchant, Manufacturer, Affiliate,  
Community, Subscription and Utility (see  Table 7). These generic models essentially classify  
companies among the nature of their value proposition or their mode of generating revenues (e.g.  
advertising, subscription or utility model).  Type of Model  Subcategories  Description  
Brokerage

 Marketplace Exchange, Business 
Trading Community, Buy/ Sell

Portal, Classifieds, Registered Users, 
Query -based Paid Placement, 
Contextual Advertising  The broadcaster, in this case a web site, 
provides content (usually for free) and services 
(like email, chat, forums) mixed with 
advertising messages i n the form of banner 
ads. The banner ads may be the major or sole 
source of revenue for the broadcaster. The 
broadcaster may be a content creator or a 
distributor of content created elsewhere.  
Infomediary

(information intermediaries) by either 
collecting data about consumers or collecting 
data about producers and their products.  
Merchant 
Model  Virtual Merchant, Catalog Merchant , 
Click and Mortar, Bit Vendor  Wholesalers and retailers of goods and 
services.  
Manufacturer 
Model  Brand Integrated Content  Manufacturers can reach buyers directly and 
thereby compress the distribution channel.  
Affiliate Model   The affiliate model provid es purchase 
opportunities wherever people may be surfing. 
It does this by offering financial incentives (in 
the form of a percentage of revenue) to 
affiliated partner sites. The affiliates provide 
purchase -point click -through to the merchant 
via their web sites.  
Community 
Model  Voluntary Contributor Model,  
Knowledge Networks  The community model is based on user 
loyalty. Users have a high investment in time 
and emotion in the site. In some cases, users 
are regular contributors of content and/or 
money.  
Subscription 
Model  Content Services, Person -to-Person 
Networking Services, Trust Services, 
Internet Service Providers  Users are charged a periodic – daily, monthly 
or annual – fee to subscribe to a service.  
 
Utility Model   The utility model is based on meter ing usage, 
or a pay as you go approach. Unlike subscriber 
services, metered services are based on actual 
usage rates

3.1.3  Business Model Components  
While defining what business mod els actually are has brought some order into the confusion, many  
authors have gone further to define of what elements business models are composed of. This is the  
first step to making business models a tool for business planning that help managers understa nd and  
describe the business logic of their firm. In this section I outline these attempts to define the business  
components, also referred to as “elements”, “building blocks”, “functions” or “attributes” of business  
models. I classify this literature amon g two main aspects , which are, on the one hand product, business 
actor - and network -centric literature and on the other hand marketing -centric literature. The authors of  
the second category most often cover both aspects mentioned above.  
However, it must be said that the different approaches and business model component descriptions  
vary greatly regarding their depth and rigor, ranging from simple enumerations to detailed  
descriptions. Some of these concepts are highly abstract and very precise and some are  merely lists of  
relatively low conceptual contribution.  In this section I simply list and describe the business model  
elements of the authors that mention business model components. It is only in section 3.1.5  that I will  
dig deeper into some of the more formal modeling approaches.  
3.1.3.1  Product -, Actor - and Network -Centric Business Model Frameworks  
Mahadevan (2000)  indicates that a business model consists of a config uration of three streams that are 
critical to the business. Firstly, the value stream , which identifies the value proposition for the business 
partners and the buyers. Secondly, the revenue stream, which is a plan for assuring revenue generation 
for the bu siness. Thirdly, the logistical stream, which addresses various issues related to the design of  
the supply chain for the business.  
Afuah and Tucci  (2003)  in contrast explain that a business model should include answers to a number  
of questions: What value to offer customers, which customers to provide the value to, how to price the 
value, who to charge for it, what strategies to undertake in providing the value, how to provide that  
value, and how to sustain any advantage from providing the value. The busine ss model approach they  
outline is value -centered and takes in account the creation of value through several actors.  In their  
conception of a business model one can find a list of business model components presented in Table 9. Comp onent  Questions for all business models  
Customer Value  The firm must ask itself if it is offering its customers something distinctive or at 
a lower cost than its competitors  
Scope  A company must define to what customers it is offering value and what rang e of 
products and services embody this value  
Pricing  Pricing is about how a firm prices the value it offers  
Revenue Source  A firm must ask itself where the income comes from and who will pay for what 
value and when. It must also define margins in each ma rket and find out what  
drives them.  
Connected Activities  The connected activities lay out what set of activities the firm has to perform to  
offer its value and when. It explains how activities are connected.  
The Business Model Ontology - a proposition in a design science approach  
31 Implementation  A company has to ask itself wha t organizational structure, systems, people, and  
environment suit the connected activities best. It must define the fit between  
them.  
Capabilities  A firm has to find out what its capabilities are and which capability gaps it has  
to fill. It should ask its elf if there is something distinctive about these  
capabilities that allow the firm to offer the value better than other firms and that 
makes them difficult to imitate.  
Sustainability  A company should understand what it is about the firm that makes it diff icult for 
other firms to imitate. It must define how it can keep making money and sustain 
a competitive advantage.  
Table 9: Afuah and Tucci’s elements of a business model  (2003)  
In line with Timmers’ business mode description abov e (1998) , Stähler  (2001; 2002)  has a network -
centric approach to business models and also excludes the marketing model from his business model  
framework. For h im a business model consists of four components as summarized in Table 10. Firstly, 
a business model contains a description of what value a customer or partner (e.g. a supplier) receives  
from the business. Stähler calls this the va lue proposition. It answers the question of what value the  
business creates for its stakeholders. Secondly, he introduces a link between the firm and the customer, 
which is the product. Thus, a business model contains a description of the product or servic es the firm  
is providing the market. It answers the question of what the firm sells. Thirdly, a business model  
contains the description of the architecture of value creation. The value architecture delineates the  
value chain, the economic agents that parti cipate in the value creation and their roles. The value  
architecture answers the question of how the value is created and in what configuration. Finally, a  
business model describes the basis and the sources of income for the firm. The value and the  
sustain ability of the business are being determined by its revenue model. This component answers the  
question of how a company earns money.  BM component  Questions to ask  
Value Proposition  What value does the company create for customers and partners?  
Product/Se rvices  What does the firm sell?  
Architecture  How and through what configuration is value created?  
Revenue Model  How does the company earn money?  
Table 10: Stähler’s business model components (based on (Stähler 2001; St ähler 2002)  
Similar to Stähler  (2001)  and also based on Timmers  (1998) , Papakiriakopoulos and Poulymenakou  
(2001)  propose a network -centric business model framework that focuses on actors and relationships.  
Their model consists of four main components, namely coordination issues, collective competition,  
customer value and co re competences. The first component aims at defining the management of  
dependencies among activities. For example the sharing of an information resource among several  
actors requires coordination mechanisms that affect the structure of the organization. Th e second  
component, collective competition, describes the relationship to other companies, which can be  
competitive, co -operator, or both at the same time. This construct resembles the concept of co -
opetition described by Brandenburger and Nalebuff  (1996) . The third component, customer value,  
aligns the business model with the market and customer needs. Finally, the core competencies def ine 
how a firm exploits its resources facing the opportunities of the market.  
Maitland and Van de Kar  (2002)  apply a  business model concept to a number of case studies in the  
mobile information and entertainment services. They describe the value proposition, the market  
segment, the companies involved and the revenue model of different innovative com panies in the  
mobile telecommunications service industry.  
Chesbrough and Rosenbloom (2000)  simply list six main functions of a business model. These are  the 
Knowledge of the Problem Domain  
32 articulation of the value proposition, the identification of the market segment, the definition of the  
structure of the value chain within the firm, the definition of the cost structure and profit potential, the 
description of the position of the firm  within the value network, including identification of  
complementors and competitors and finally the formulation of the competitive strategy.  
Unlike most other authors on business model components Alt and Zimmermann  (2001)  include  
elements such as mission, processes, legal issues and technology into their framework. The six generic 
elements they mention are outlined in Table  11. BM element  descripti on 
Mission  A critical part of the business model is developing a high -level understanding of the  
overall vision, strategic goals and the value proposition including the basic product or  
service features.  
Structure  Structure determines the roles of the di fferent agents involved and the focus on  
industry, customers and products.  
Processes  Processes provide a more detailed view on the mission and the structure of the business 
model. It shows the elements of the value creation process.  
Revenues  Revenues are  the "bottom line" of a business model.  
Legal issues  Legal issues influence all aspects of the business model and the general vision  
Technology  Technology is an enabler and a constraint for IT -based business models. Also,  
technological change has an impa ct on the business model design.  
Table 11: Alt and Zimmermann's (2001)  business model elements  
3.1.3.2  Marketing -Specific Frameworks  
Authors presented in this section include marketing specific issues into their business model  
frameworks. A very interesting business model proposition has been developed by Hamel (2000) . For  
him a business model is simply a business concept that has been put into practice, but for which he  
develops a number of elements. He identifies four main business model components that  range from  
core strategy, strategic resources over value network to customer interface. These components are  
related to each other through three “bridges” and are decomposed into different sub -elements. The 
main contribution of this concept illustrated in  Figure 16 and Table 12 is a view of the overall picture  
of a firm.

33   Name  Description  
Core Strategy  This element defines the overall business mission, which captures what the  
business model is designed to accomplish. Further, it defines the product and  
market scope and specifies in what segments the company competes. Finally, it  
outlines how the firm competes differently than its competitors.  
Strategic 
Resources  This element c ontains the core competencies of a firm. In other words, what a firm 
knows, its skills and unique capabilities. Then it specifies the strategic assets, such 
as infrastructure, brands and patents. Last, this element outlines the core processes  
of the firm; it explains what people actually do.  
Customer 
Interface  This element is composed of fulfillment and support, which refers to the way the  
firm goes to market and reaches its customers (e.g. channels). Second, information 
and insight defines all the knowle dge that is collected from and used on behalf of  
the customer. Third, the relationship dynamics refer to the nature of the interaction 
between the producer and the customer. Finally, the pricing structure explains what 
you charge the customer for and how y ou do this.  Elements  
Value 
Network  The value network outlines the network that surrounds the firm and complements  
and amplifies the firm’s resources. It is composed of suppliers, partners and  
coalitions. Partners typically supply critical complements to a final  product or  
solution, whereas coalitions represent alliances with like -minded competitors.  
Configuration  This connection refers to the unique way in which competencies, assets, and  
processes are combined and interrelated in support of a partic ular strategy.  
Customer 
Benefits  This link intermediates between the core strategy and the customer interface. It  
defines the particular bundle of benefits that is actually being offered to the  
customer.  Connections  
Company 
Boundaries  This bridge refers to the dec isions that have been made about what the firm does  
and what it contracts out the value network.  
Table 12: Hamel’s (2000)  business model components  
Like Hamel  (2000) , Linder and Cantrell  (2000)  propose a comprehensive  approach to business  
models. Further, they stress the fact that many people speak of business models when they actually  
only mean a specific component of a business model.  They list the following components: the pricing  
model, the revenue model, the chann el model, the commerce process model, the Internet -enabled 
commerce relationship, the organizational form and the value proposition (see Figure 17).

Figure 17: Linder and Cantre ll’s (2000)  business model concept  
Weill and Vitale  (2001)  have a slightly different approach, they give a system atic and practical  
analysis of eight so called atomic e-business models as describe in  Table  6. These atomic business  
models can be combined to form an e -business initiative. Every one of these atomic e -business mod els 
is analyzed according to its strategic objectives and value proposition, its sources of revenue, its  
critical success factors and its core competencies. In addition the authors also outline the elements to  
analyze an e-business initiative which are a business model’s channels, customer segments and IT -
Infrastructure.  BM Element  Description  
Strategic Objective 
and Value 
Proposition  Gives an overall view of the target customer, the product and service  
offering and the unique and valuable position targeted by the firm. It  
defines what choices and trad -offs the firm will make.  
Sources of Revenue  A realistic view of the sources of revenue is a fundamental question for e -
business models.  
Critical Success 
Factors  These are things a  firm must do well to flourish. There are a set of general 
critical success factors for every atomic business model.  Business model summary  
Core Competencies  These are the competencies necessary that should be created, nurtured,  
and developed in -house and contribute to the pow er of a business model.  
Customer Segments  According to Weill and Vitale an e-business initiative should always start 
with the customer. This means understanding which customer segments  
are targeted and what the value p roposition is for each segment.  
Channels  A channel is the conduit by which a firm's products or services are offered 
or distributed to the customer. Reaching target customer segments  
requires careful channel selection and management. Interestingly the  
authors add that in e-business the channel should be considered a feature  
of the product offer and thus part of the value proposition.  Elements of an e -business 
initiative  
IT Infrastructre  The IT infrastructure is used in to connect the different parts of the firm  
and link to suppliers, cust omers, and allies.  
Table 13: Weill and Vitale's business model and e -business initiative elements (2001)  
The business model approach by Petrovic, Kittl et al.  (Petrovic, Kittl et al. 2001)  suggests that a  
business model can be divided in to seven sub -models, which are the value model, the resource model,  
the production model, the customer relations model, the revenue model, the capital model and the  Who are our

The Business Model Ontology - a proposition in a design science approach  
35 market model. These sub -models and their interrelation shall describe the logic of a busine ss system  
for creating value that lies behind the actual processes.  The value model describes the logic of what  
core products, services and experiences are delivered to the customer and other value -added services  
derived from the core competence. The reven ue model describes the logic of how elements are  
necessary for the transformation process, and how to identify and procure the required quantities. The  
production model describes the logic of how elements are combined in the transformation process  
from the  source to the output. The customer relations model scribes the logic of how to reach, serve,  
and maintain customers. It consists of the following sub -models: a distribution model  – the logic  
behind the delivery processes, a marketing model  – the logic beh ind reaching and maintaining  
customers and a service model  – the logic behind serving the customer. The revenue model describes  
the logic of what, when, why, and how the company receives compensation in return for the products. 
The capital model describes  the logic of how financial sourcing occurs to create a debt and equity  
structure, and how that money is utilised with respect to assets and liabilities over time. The market  
model describes the logic of choosing a relevant environment in which the business  operates.  
Compared to the previous authors Magretta  (2002)  has a very simple and pragmatic view on business  
models. She distinguishes between two elementary parts of a business model. On the one hand the  
business activities associated wi th making something (e.g. design, procurement, and manufacturing)  
and on the other hand the business activities associated with selling something (e.g. customer  
identification, selling, transaction handling, distribution and delivery).  
3.1.4  Representation Tool s 
In addition to outlining the components of a business model, some authors offer a set of business  
model representation tools. Weill and Vitale  (2001)  have developed a formalism to assist analyzing e-
business initiatives, which they call e-business model schematic. The schematic is a pictorial  
repre sentation, aiming to high -light a business model's important elements. This includes the firm of  
interest, its suppliers and allies, the major flows of product, information and money and finally the  
revenues and other benefits each participant receives. By  using such a representation the authors  
intend to uncover major contradictions of a business model, highlight the core competencies to  
implement the model, show the position of each player in the industry value chain, deduce the  
organizational form and IT  infrastructure for implementation and reveal which entity owns the  
customer relationship, data, and transaction.

The design approach of Gordijn  (2002) , which among other things aims at visualizing business models 
is outl ined in the following section.  
3.1.5  Ontological Modelling  
Whereas the business model frameworks presented until here stay relatively informal and descriptive  
this section treats of ontology -style models. Under ontological  modelling I understand a rigorous  
approach to defining business models. In other terms this means carefully and precisely defining  
business model terms, concepts, components and their relationships. From the authors analyzed in  this 
literature review Gordijn  (2002)  provide s the most rigorous conceptual modeling approach, which  he Service Provider Customer    Firm of Interest Supplier Customer Ally $ 0 i Electronic Relationship Primary Relationship Flow of Money Flow of Product Flow of Information 
Knowledge of the Problem Domain  
36 calls e3-value ™. This methodology is based on a generic value -oriented ontology specifying what's in 
an e-business model. On the one hand it has the goal of improving communication and decision  
making related to e-business and on the other hand it aims at enhancing and  sharpening the  
understanding of e-business operations and requirements through scenario analysis and quantification  
(cf. 3.1.5 ). e3-value consists of a number of generic concepts and relationships illustrated in Figure  19. 
Gordijn  specif ies actors that produce, distribute or consume objects of value by performing value  
activities. The objects of value are exchanged via value interfaces of actors or activities. Value  
interfaces have value  ports offering or requesting objects of value. The trade of value objects is  
represented by value exchanges, which interconnect value ports of actors or value interfaces.  
 
Figure 19: e3-value ontology f or e-business (Gordijn, Akkermans et al. 2001)  
The e3-value methodology has been applied to a real world business case and evaluated one -year-and-
a-half later  (Gordijn and Akkermans 2003) . Lessons learned include that the method is lacking a  
marketing perspective, that business units should be included in the analysis and that it would be  
helpful to work with evolutionary scenarios. However, Gordijn and Akkerman s are positive about  
their methodology enhancing the common understanding of business ideas, which was not possible by  
traditional e.g. verbal ways. Furthermore, they believe that a model -based approach to business  
problems can help asses the consequences of changes in business models.  
3.1.6  Business Models and Change  
Because models are static by nature and simply take a snapshot of a current situation, a number of  
authors add a time trajectory to business models and introduce the concept of change. This allows  
them to go from a current state or business model to a desired state or new business model. Linder and 
Cantrell (2000) , for example, mention that business models  are a picture at a point in time, but that  
most firm’s business models are under constant pressure to change because of numerous pressures in  
the firm’s environ ment (e.g. technology, law and competition)(cf. also  2.3). Therefore and in order to  
coordinate and channel change inside a company they introduce so -called change models.  They 
distinguish four basic types according to their degree to which they change the core logic of a  
company, namely realization models , renewal models, extension models and journey models (see  
Figure 20). The realization model focuses on small changes in the existing business model of a firm in  
order to maximize its potential. It often involves preoccupations, su ch as brand maintenance, product  
line extensions, geographic expansions or additional sales channels. Renewal models are characterized 
by consistent revitalization of product and service platforms, brands, cost structures and technology  
bases. According to  Linder and Cantrell a renewing firm leverages its core skills to create new  
positions on the price/value curve. This kind of change model also often involves attacking untouched  
markets and introducing new retailing formats. Extension models expand busine sses to cover new  
ground. An extending company stretches its operating model to include new markets, value chain  
functions, and product and service lines. This kind of model often involves forward, backward and  Actor

37 horizontal integration in the value chain. Fi nally, journey models provoke most change and take a  
company to a complete new business model.  
 
Figure 20: Change Models (Linder and Cantrell 2000)  
Tapscott, Ticoll et al.  (2000)  propose a change methodology in six steps towards creating a b-web 
company (cf. Figure 15 and Table 4). The first step consists of describing the current value proposition 
by defining end -customers, offerings, customer value and the value proposition’s strengths and  
weaknesses from a customer’s perspective. The second step consists of disaggrega ting and identifying 
the entities that contribute to the total value -creation system. The following step envisions b-web 
enable value. In other words, planners must step outside their day -to-day mental models to develop  
creative and discontinuous views of  doing business. This means asking what new business models  – 
ways of creating, setting, and delivering value and facilitating relationships with customers, suppliers,  
and partners  – could be envisaged. In the fourth step the company must reaggregate. This  step entails  
repopulating the categories of value contributors and assigning contributions to the various classes of  
participants. The fifth step consists of preparing a value map, which is a graphical depiction of how a  
b-web operates. It identifies the participants, such as strategic partners, suppliers and customers and  
their exchanges of value. The last step consists of doing the b -web mix, which means considering how 
each type and subtype might enhance customer value, provide competitive differentiatio n and  
advantage and reduce costs for the participants.  
In his e3-value methodology Gordijn  (2002)  outlines a change methodology based on value model  
deconstruction and reconstruction, which is mainly inspired by Tapscott, Ticoll et al.  (2000)  Evans  
and Wurster  (2000)  and Timmers  (1999) . He splits the process into two questions, namely, which  
value adding activities exist, and which actors are willing to perform these activities.  
Petrovic, Kittl et al. (2001)  specify that the improvement and change of a real world business model is 
related to the ability to change a manager’s mental model. According to them, people often talk about  
reducing time and costs via automati ng or redesigning processes when really they want to improve  
their business model. To change this Petrovic, Kittl et al. introduce double -loop learning to explicit  
mental models through a systemic business model concept in order to provide a holistic, broa d, long -
term and dynamic view to help redesign business models.  
Papakiriakopoulos and Poulymenakou  (2001)  propose a transformation method for constructing e-
business models based on their analytical framework outlined in secti on 3.1.3.1 . The method includes  
4 steps, ranging from the identification of players, over highlighting the value flows and identifying  
key competitive drivers to constructing a feedback chain. Thus, the first step consists of defining the  
context and the scope of the business model. This means identifying the list of stakeholders and  
describing their strategy. The second step consists of drawing the relationships and flows between the  
actors in order to capture the value chain concepts. Papakiriakopoulos and Poulymenakou recognize  
two main flows, which are the financial flows and the communication flows. The next step of this  
methodology is about identifying the nature of competition in the marketplace. The fourth and final  
step of the method aims at constructing a so called "feedback chain". The objective of the feedback  
chain is to examine and collect all the information resources that could help and empower some  Journey model

38 processes that are placed on the value chain. The authors have app lied this method to a case in the  
media industry that broadcasts advertisements in the form of video and/or interactive content and  
wants to measure efficiency in order to offer personalized information through a TV set -top box in the 
consumer's household.  Papakiriakopoulos and Poulymenakou found that the framework and  
methodology helped highlighting several issues corresponding to the four elements of their model,  
namely coordination, customer value, competition and core competencies.  
3.1.7  Business Model Evalu ation and Indicators  
A last, but nevertheless very important and challenging field of business model research concerns the  
definition of indicators, business model measurement and evaluation. A number of authors have  
written on this question, attacking the  problem from different angels  (Hamel 2000; Gordijn 2002;  
Afuah and Tucci 2003) .  
Hamel (2000) , for example, talks of the wealth potential of a business model that covers four factors.  
Firstly, it questions to which extent the business concept is an efficient way of delivering customer  
benefits. Secondly, it covers the extent to which the business con cept is unique. Differentiation is of  
immense importance because the more similar business models, the less probable are chances for  
above -average profits. Thirdly, it analyzes the degree of fit among the elements of the business  
concept. Finally, it quest ions the extent to which the business concept exploits profit boosters that  
have the potential to generate above -average returns. Under profit boosters Hamel understands  
increasing returns, competitor lock -out, strategic economies and strategic flexibility .  
Afuah and Tucci  (2003)  appraise business models on three levels. Namely profitability measures,  
profitability predictor measures and business model component attribute measures. The first level  
embraces earnings and cash flows, two frequently used indic ators by analysts. If a firm's earnings or  
cash flows are better than those of competitors, this would mean that it has a competitive advantage.  
The second level comprises profit margins, revenue market share and revenue growth. Again, a firm  
has a competi tive advantage if these measures indicate a better performance than competitors.  The 
third and capital level provides benchmark questions for each of Afuah and Tucci's business model  
components (cf. section 3.1.3.1 . and see Table 14). Component of Business 
Model  Benchmark Questions  
Customer Value  Is customer value distinct from that competitors? If not, ist the firm's level of 
value higher than that of competitors?  
Is the firm's rate of increase in cust omer value high relative to that of  
competitors?  
Scope  Is the growth rate of market segments high?  
Is the firm's market share in each segment high relative to that of  
competitors'?  
Is potential erosion of products high? If so, in what segments?  
Pricing  Is the quality -adjusted price low?  
Revenue Source  Are margins and market share in each revenue source high?  
Are margins and market share in each revenue source increasing?  
Is the firm's value in each source of revenue distinctive? If not, is the level of 
value higher than that of competitors?  
Connected Activities  What is the extent to which activities:  
Are consistent with customer value and scope?  
Reinforce each other?  
Take advantage of industry success drivers?  
Are consistent with the firm's distinctive c apabilities?  
Make the industry more attractive for the firm?

Table 14: Appraising a Business Model: Component Measures (Afuah and Tucci 2003)  
The probably most advanced proposition for evaluating business models is outlined by Gordijn (2002)  
and is part of their e3-value method. They propose studying th e economic feasibility of an e-business 
idea in quantitative terms by creating a profit sheet and assessing the value of objects for all actors  
involved. This is possible because their method is highly actor -, network - and value -centered and  
focuses and th e value exchanges among business model participants (cf. 3.1.5 ). The authors admit that 
this evaluation serves for building confidence in an e-business idea rather than calculating precise  
profit estimations, which would be unrealistic. Further, Gordijn introduce s an additional confidence -
building step through  the elaboration of “whati -if” scenarios. This helps stakeholders understand the  
sensitivity of e-business models with respect to its parameters, such as financials, future trends or  
customer behavior.  
3.2  ONTOLOGIES  
The second field of research that has infl uenced this dissertation is ontologies, particularly in IS. I  
outline some of the existing work in the following lines.  
The term Ontology (with a capital "O") has its origin in philosophy and denotes the philosophical  
discipline that deals with the nature  and the organization of reality, contrary to Epistemology, which  
deals with the nature and sources of our knowledge  (Guarino and Giaretta 1995) . In this thesis I use  
the term ontology (with the lowercase "o") to which I refer to with Gruber's  (1993)  definition as an  
explicit specification of a conceptualization. And I refer to a conceptualization as an intentional  
semantic structure which encodes the implicit rules constraining the  structure of a piece of reality  
(Guarino and Giaretta 1995) .  
In order to clarify what an ontology is Ushold and Gruninger  (1996)  refer to a quote from the SRKB  
(Shared Re -usable Knowledge Bases) electronic mailing list that nicely summarizes its signification  
and the various forms and contexts it arises in.  
"Ontologies are agreements about shared conceptualizations. Shared  
conceptualizations include conceptual frameworks for modeling domain knowledge;  
content -specific protocols for communication among inter -operating agents; and  
agreements about the representation of particular domain theories. In the knowledge  
sharing context, ontologies are  specified in the form of definitions of representational  
vocabulary. A very simple case would be a type hierarchy, specifying classes and their 
subsumption relationships. Relational database schemata also serve as ontologies by  
specifying the relations tha t can exist in some shared database and the integrity  
constraints that must hold for them."  
After emerging in the artificial intelligence community and being applied to knowledge engineering  
ontologies are increasingly used in IS and IT. The main goal of applying ontologies in IS is the  
development and implementation of an explicit account of a shared understanding in a given subject  
area in order to solve a problem  (Ushold and Gruninger 1996) . Furthermore,  Moschella (2002, p.25)  
describes IT ontologies as "logical supersets that combine metadata, taxonomies and semantics into  
formal systems that can be encoded in software, enabling diverse Web applications to truly understand 
one another". He also indicates that after the IT industry standardization efforts have focused on  
hardware, software and communication technologies the frontier is constantly shifting towards  
information itself . Moschella  (2002, p.25)  believes this will "require the systematic management of  
business terms and their usage". T he main set of problems this shift addresses can be found in a text by 
Knowledge of the Problem Domain  
40 Ushold and Gruninger (1996) : 
• poor communication within and between people and their organization.  
• difficulties in identifying the requirements and the specification of IT systems.  
• poor inter -operability.  
• poor use of potential re -use and sharing.  
• as a consequence of the above much effort is wasted in re -inventing the wheel.  
Concretely, the effort to define ontologies in business has taken two different forms. Firstly, there are  
those ontologies that belong in the category of the so -called enterprise ontologies that describe the  
concepts related to the nature and structure of the business enterprise. Secondly, there are the  
transaction related ontologies, essentially used in e-business and aimed at specifying information in  
electronic business transactions in order to improve and automate these transactions (Fensel 2001) . For 
the purpose of this thesis we will shortly survey the efforts in the former category. These are enterprise 
models with the goal of being a computational representation of the structure, activities, processes,  
information, resources, peop le, behavior, goals and constraints of a business, government, or other  
enterprise (Fox and Grüninger 1997) .  
3.2.1  Business Engineering Model (BEM)  
This model represents a set of formalisms to specify the core metadata found in the op erational and  
data warehousing environment of enterprises, in order to support interoperability among them  
(Bertolazzi, Krusich et al. 2001) . The concepts are described in UML. The model c aptures information 
on business goals, the organization, the business processes and business rules.  
3.2.2  The Edinburgh Enterprise Ontology  
The work of the Edinburgh Group is aimed at proposing an enterprise ontology  (Ushold, King et al.  
1997) , i.e. a set of carefully defined concepts that are widely used for describing enterprises in general  
and that can serve as a stable basis for specifying software requirements  (Bertolazzi, Krusich et al.  
2001) . The group has developed tools for modeling enterprises and processes . The Enterprise  
Ontology is proposed as a way to communicate, integrate and represent in a unique way the various  
aspects of an enterprise. The Enterprise Ontology is represented in an informal way (text version) and  
in a semi -formal way (Ontolingua). The  ontology first presents natural language definitions for all the  
terms, starting with the foundational concepts, such as entity, relationship and actors (i.e. the meta -
ontology). These are then used to define the main body of terms, which are divided into  four subject  
areas (Ushold, King et al. 1997) , namely:  
• Activities  
• Organiz ation  
• Strategy  
• Marketing  
3.2.3  The Toronto Virtual Enterprise (TOVE)  
The Toronto Virtual Enterprise  aims at delivering a model that supports model -driven enterprise  
design, analysis and operation  (Fox and Gruninger 1998) . This project has formally defined a set of  
concepts that are general enough to allow their use in different applications. The concepts, similarly to 
the Enterprise Ontology, a re grouped into thematic sections. For each concept, properties and relations 
are defined. However, unlike the semi -formal Enterprise Ontology, the Toronto Virtual Enterprise is  
rigorously formal. In other words, it has meticulously defined terms with form al semantics, theorems  
and proofs of such properties as soundness and completeness (Ushold and Gruninger 1996) . Basically, 
the generic, reusable enterprise data model has the following characteristics (TOVE 2002) . It:  
• provides a shared terminology for the enterprise that each agent can jointly understand and use,  
The Business Model Ontology - a proposition in a design science approach  
41 • defines the meaning of each term (i.e. semantics) in a precise and as unambiguous manner as  
possible,  
• implements the semantics in a set of axioms that will enable  Toronto Virtual Enterprise  to 
automatically deduce the answer to many "common sense" q uestions about the enterprise, and  
• defines a symbology for depicting a term or the concept constructed thereof in a graphical  
context.  
3.2.4  Enterprise Ontologies versus Business Model Ontology  
In this dissertation I pick up the idea of building a business on tology aiming at improving  
understanding, communication and flexibility just as do the  Enterprise Ontology  and the  Toronto 
Virtual Enterprise . But while these overall objectives might seem quite similar, the domain and  
content of the ontology delivered in the following chapters of this dissertation is substantially different. 
While the  Enterprise Ontology  and the  Toronto Virtual Enterprise  focus essentially on structural  
aspects of business I aim at formalizing business concepts in the business model domain . My goal is to 
provide a semi -formal ontology for business models by following Ushold and Gruninger's  (1996)  
guidelines for building an ontology:  
• Capturing & coding the ontology: Identify the key concepts and relationships in the domain of 
interest and  produce unambiguous text definitions of them.  
• Evaluating the ontology: Test the internal and external consistency of the ontology.  
• Documenting the ontology: Meticulously document the provided ontology.  
The Business Model Ontology  
42 4 THE BUSINESS MODEL O NTOLOGY  
4.1  INTRODUCING THE ONT OLO GY 
4.1.1  The Nine Building Blocks  
As explained in several previou s sections of this dissertation  the main goal of this research is to  
provide an ontology that allows to accurately describe the business model of a firm. In order to  
achieve this I have, in a firs t step, identified four main  areas  that constitute the essential business  
model issues of a company. In a second step I have broken these  areas  down into a set of nine  
interrelated building blocks that allow to conceive a business model.  
Influenced by the  Balanced Scorecard approach  (Kaplan and Norton 1992)  and more generally  
business management literature  (Markides 1999)  I suggest adopting a framework which  
emphasizes on the following four areas  that a business model has to address:  
 
• PRODUCT: What business  the company is in, the  products  and the value proposition s 
offered to the market.  
• CUSTOMER INTERFACE : Who the company's target customers are, how it delivers  
them products and services, and how it builds a strong relationships with them.  
• INFRASTRUCTURE MANAGEMENT: How the compa ny efficiently performs  
infrastructural or logistical issues, with whom, and as what kind of network enterprise.  
• FINANCIAL ASPECTS: What is the revenue model, the cost structure and the business  
model’s sustainability.  
 
These four  areas  can be compared to  the four perspectives of Norton and Kaplan's Balanced  
Scorecard approach  (Kaplan and Norton 1992) . The Balanced Scorecard is a management  
concept developed in the e arly 90s that helps managers measure and monitor indicators other than 
purely financial ones. The authors compare their now quite well known tool to an airplane cockpit 
where the pilot flies the plane by reacting to the information they get from their boar d tools.  
Evidently this information has to cover all relevant aspects of flying a plane. The same applies to 
companies where managers have to monitor the essential areas of a business in order to lead it.  
Norton and Kaplan identify four perspectives of the  firm on which executives must keep an eye to 
conduct successful business. In the customer perspective the company asks itself how it is seen by 
its customers. In the Internal perspective the company reflects on what it must excel at. In the  
innovation and  learning perspective the company analyzes how it can continue to improve and  
create value. Finally, in the financial perspective a company asks itself how it looks to  
shareholders. These perspectives seem quite adequate as a starting point for a business  model 
ontology, all the more since Norton and Kaplan propose that they can serve for mapping strategy 
in some of their later work (Kaplan and Norton 2000) .  
Markides (Markides 1999)  follows a similar path by providing a very simple recipe to business  
strategy. He recommends looking at the "who" the "what" and the "how" of a business. This  
means the first question executives must ask themselves is who they should target as customers.  
The second question is about what products or services a company should offer. The last question 
is abo ut how these services can be delivered best to customers. These three intuitive trajectories  
are comparable to the perspectives mentioned above if one adds the financial aspect to Markides'  
recipe. In Table 15 I show how the pillar s of the ontology compare to Kaplan and Norton (2000)  
and to Markides (1999) .

Table 15: The four business model pillars  
But as I do not want to stay at this level of  low granularity and description  and want to mov e 
towards something more detailed  and formal  I split the four pillars of the business model  
ontology into nine interrelated business model building blocks, or simply business model  
elements . While the four areas are a rough categorization the nine elements  are the core of the  
ontology. These elements, presented in  Table 16, are a synthesis of the business model literature  
review described in section  3.1 and consist of value proposition, target customer, distribution  
channel, relationship, value configuration, capability, partnership, cost structure and revenue  
model.  Pillar  Building Block of 
Business Model  Description  
Product  Value Proposition  A Value Proposition is an overall view of a company's  
bundle of products and services that are of value to the  
customer.  
Target Customer  The Target Customer is a segment of customers a company 
wants to offer value to.  
Distribution Chan nel A Distribution Channel is a means of getting in touch with 
the customer.  Customer 
Interface  
Relationship  The Relationship describes the kind of link a company  
establishes between itself and the customer.  
Value Configuration  The Value Configur ation describes the arrangement of  
activities and resources that are necessary to create value  
for the customer.  
Capability  A capability is the ability to execute a repeatable pattern of 
actions that is necessary in order to create value for the  
custome r.  Infrastructure 
Management  
Partnership  A Partnership is a voluntarily initiated cooperative  
agreement between two or more companies in order to  
create value for the customer.  
Cost Structure  The Cost Structure is the representation in money of all the 
means e mployed in the business model.  
Financial Aspects  
Revenue Model  The Revenue Model describes the way a company makes  
money through a variety of revenue flows.  
Table 16: The nine business model building blocks  
Figure 21 gives  the reader a first overview of the business model ontology and how the specific  
The Business Model Ontology  
44 elements relate to each other.  The elements will be described in further detail in the following  
sections.  
 
Figure 21: The  Business Model Ontology  
However, before coming to a detailed ontology description I show that the nine business model  
elements are based on a synthesis of the existing business model literature in  Table 17 and Table 
18. In other words, I have identified what business model building blocks have been proposed by  
the other authors in the field and constructed a new model taking their contributions  into account. 
As explained in the literature review, some autho rs have simply mentioned their proposed  
elements, others have explained them and a last group has conceptualized them. The aim of this  
dissertation was to propose a business model integrating the existing work and going a step  
further by conceptualizing ev ery singly element and then integrating them into a whole.  
Basically, the nine elements of the ontology cover all the business model building blocks  
mentioned by at least two authors. Furthermore, I have excluded elements related to the  
competitive landsc ape and to implementation, which I understand as related to the business model 
but not as internal part of it.  Table 17 and Table 18 name the elements proposed by the other  
authors and show how they relate  to the ontology.  Some authors have proposed elements not  
covered in the ontology. For example, Petrovic, Kittle et al. (2001)  mention the capital model  and 
the market model  as a business model componen t. I believe these are, though important  part of  
the business, exterior to the business model of the firm. Former is important to realize a business  
model (Chesbrough and Rosenbloom 2000)  and latter is important to situate a business model in  
the competitive landscape ( cf. section  2.3), but they  are not part of the business model. Similarly, 
Afuah and Tucci  (2003)  mention the profit site, which is a company's location in a value  
configuration vis -à-vis its suppliers, customers, rivals, potential new entrants, complementors,  
and su bstitutes. In my approach I would rather see this element as a part of strategy, positioning  
the firm in the competitive landscape and designing the company's business model accordingly.  
Likewise, two authors mention elements related to business model impl ementation in their  
business model concept (Linder and Cantrell 2000; Afuah and Tucci 2003)  that I do not conceive 
as internal to the bus iness model but related to its execution.  
Finally, in the evaluation section ( see section  1) I will show how the ontology relates to the other  
authors in the domain in regard to modeling intensity of the different business model building  
blocks.  Channel  Value Configuration  Value Proposition  Capability  Customer

 47 4.1.2  Notation and Labeling of the Ontology Elements  
The business model ontology is a set of elements and their relationships that aim at describing the 
mone y earning logic  of a firm. As outlined above the ontology contains nine business model  
buildin g blocks, so -called business model elements.  The characteristics of each of them is  
described in the form of a table (cf.  Table 19) and thereafter explained in more detail in the  
following pages.  Every business model element can be  decomposed into a set of defined sub -
elements. This decomposition allows studying business models on different levels of granularity  
in more or less detail and according to specific needs.  
Name of BM -Element  NAME  
Definition  Gives a precise description o f the business model element.  Part of  Defines to which pillar of the ontology the element belongs to or of which  element it is a sub -element  Related to  Describes to which other elements of the ontology an element is related to.  
Set of  Indicates into whi ch sub -elements an element can be decomposed.  Cardinality  Defines the number of allowed occurrences of an element or sub -element inside the ontology.  Attributes  Lists the attributes of the element or sub -element. The allowed values of an 
attribute are in dicated between accolades {VALUE1, VALUE2}. Their 
occurrences are indicated in brackets (e.g. 1 -n).  
Each element and sub -element has two standard attributes which are NAME and DESCRIPTION that contain a chain of characters {abc}.  
References  Indicates the  main references related to the business model element.  
Table 19: Description of a business model element  
Every business model element is described precisely, textually and graphically (cf.  Figure 22). In 
the graphical presentation the yellow boxes indicate the elements and sub -elements that are being 
discussed in a specific section. The grey boxes indicate the related elements.  
As illustrated in the graphical descriptions and defined in the tables element  and a sub -element 
are related to each other through a "setOf" and "isA" relationship. The former relationship  
indicates that an element can be decomposed into a finer level of granularity, whereas the latter  
indicates that there is a relationship of inheri tance between element and sub -element.

48 4.2  PRODUCT  
Traditionally, companies concentrated on positioning themselves in the right place on the value  
chain, with the right products and market segments and the right value -added services. But  
through globalization, rapidly changing markets and new technologies things have become more  
complex and complicated. Companies increasingly organize in networks and offer bundles of  
products and services as a group. Today the art of crea ting and co -producing value with others is  
clearly at the centre of strategic tasks  (Normann and Ramírez 1993) . As shown previously this is  
essentially due to the falling costs of ICT and the increased connectivity of actors, which has  
opened up new possibilities for creating co -engineered information goods and services, new  
information -based value -added services or information -rich physical goods. Especially e -business 
value propositions tend to be complex and hard to communicate in an easy way.  
The major impact of ICT on product innovation was the separation of information and physical  
goods (i.e. the physical carrier of information) and the resulting ease of distribution (cf.  
Illustration Box  3). Look at this following simple illustration. A book is made of content (which  
is an information good) and paper (which  is its physical carrier). By separating information and  
carrier the book can be diffused through a variety of electronic or bricks -and-mortar channels.  
Imagine you were in a local book store and you were looking for something they do not have in  
stock. If  the store had so -called print -on-demand facilities they could download the content and  
print out the book in a matter of minutes. A similar concept is very common in some music  
stores. Customers can chose song titles out of a large data base and get them  burnt on a CD  
immediately. In fact, many people already download or buy music over the Internet directly to  
their homes. In more economic terms these examples meant that one is not limited to the  
economics of things anymore, but enters the "new economics o f information" (Evans and Wurster 
1997) . This simply means that a company can easily reach a large number of customers and  
provide them with very rich information or added value in form of multimedia data, personalized  
information or customized products. One company that realized this very quickly was Federal  
Express. In 1994 it extended its value proposition by offering additional services on a newly  
launched Website. FedEx was the first to offer online package status tracking, which allowed  
each and every customers to follow their package during its delivery. While this has not  
profoundly changed the shipping industry, other sectors, such as the music an d film industry risk  
to be completely transformed because their products can be entirely digitized. An example of the  
trembling fundaments of the music industry was the notorious fight of the major record  
companies against the file -trading platform called  Napster (Rupp and Esthier 2003) . This forced  
them to rethink their value proposition or even their entire business model  (Durlacher 2001) . In 
general, companies that are not able to constant ly innovate risk to fall into the commoditization  
trap because successful products are rapidly copied by an ever more global competition. Of  
course innovation is no guarantee for success, but recent research shows that superior market  
performers are essent ially companies that are able to innovate and constantly transform their  
value proposition  (Kim and Mauborgne 1997; Chen and Kai -Ling Ho 2002) . In the business  
model ontology this is expressed in product innovation, which is one of the main four pillars of a 
business model.

Definition : PRODUCT covers all aspects of what a firm offers its customers. This comprises not  
only the company's bundles of products and services but the manner in which it differentiates  
itself from its competitors. PRODUCT is composed of the element VALUE PROPOSITION,  
which can be decomposed into its elementary OFFERING(s) (see Figure 23). 
 
Figure 23: Product  
4.2.1  Valu e Proposition Element  
The VALUE PROPOSITION is the first of the nine elements of the business model ontology and 
can be understood as the statements of benefits that are delivered by the firm to its external  
constituencies (Bagchi and Tulskie 2000) . I describe it as the definition of how items of value,  
such as products and services as well as complementary value -added services, are packaged and  
offered to  fulfill  customer needs  (Kambil, Ginsberg et al. 1997) . In order to better understand  
value and to construct new and innovative bundles of products and services, I propose a  
conceptual approach outlined in the VALUE PROPOSITION element. This al lows firms to  Value Proposition  Target Customer  
Offering  setOf  isA Capability  Digital Product Innovation at  Audible  
Audible is  a company that  sells spoken audio content, such as audio versions of books, magazines,  newspapers or radio programs. As opposed to its more traditional competitors, Audible does not deliver its content in form of CDs or audio cassettes. It converts audio books and other spoken audio programs to digital files that can be delivered directly to the customer's PC over the internet and are enjoyed on  the computer or on a range of hand -held electronic devices like Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) or  MP3 players. Through the unbundling of the information component and its physical carrier, Audible  can offer a whole new value proposition that has redefined the industry it is competing in. Firstly,  because it carries no physical inventory it can propose a browsable catalog of more than 5,800 digital  audio books and more than 15,000 other audio selections on its audible.com Website. Secondly,  delivery is instant and depends only on the customer's Internet bandwidth. Thirdly, because the audio  content is delivered as a digital file it stays portable and can be burnt on a CD or transferred to a mobile audio player. And finally, audible.com is accessible from any PC with and Internet connection.  The target customers the firm wants to address are essentially  people that take their Audible programs  to their workout at the gym,  commute in their cars or the subway or simply want to turn their downtime  into productive time. In order to deliver its value proposition the company has to have a number of  capabilities at its disposal. Most importantly, it must be able to offer supreme content that its customers value. Furthermore it must excel in Information Technology (IT), in order to manage digital content, its Website and the digital delivery  of audio files.

Furthermore, such a systematic approach makes value innovation easier. The construct of the  
VALUE PROPOSITION explained in the following paragra phs is inspired by the works of  
(Kambil, Ginsberg et al. 1997)  and (Kim and Mauborgne 2002) , which provide the foundation for 
a more conceptual approach to value.  
The element VALUE PROPOSITION is an overall view of one of the firm's bundles of products  
and services that together represent value for  a specific CUSTOMER SEGMENT. It describes the 
way a firm differentiates itself from its competitors and is the reason why customers buy from a  
certain firm and not from another.  Name of BM -Element  VALUE PROPOSITION  
Definition  A VALUE PROPOSITION represents value for  one or several TARGET 
CUSTOMER(s) and is based on one or several CAPABILITY(ies). It can be 
further decomposed into its set of  elementary OFFERING(s). A VALUE 
PROPOSITION is characterized by its attributes DESCRIPTION, 
REASONING, VALUE LEVEL and PRICE LEVEL and an optional LIFE 
CYCLE.

While the VALUE PROPOSITION element gives an aggregated view of a value bundle that a  
company off ers a CUSTOMER SEGMENT it can be further decomposed into a set of elementary 
OFFERINGs. By describing these different components of a VALUE PROPOSITION a firm can  
better observe how it situates itself compared to its competitors. This will potentially allo w a 
company to innovate and differentiate to achieve a competitive position.  
An elementary OFFERING describes a part of a firm's bundle of products and services. It  
illustrates a specific product, service, or even product or service feature and outlines it s assumed  
value to the customer. A set of elementary OFFERINGs together represent a  VALUE 
PROPOSITION.

Table 21: Offering  
REASONING : This attribute captures the reasoning on why the firm thinks its VALUE  
PROPOSITION or a specific elem entary OFFERING could be valuable to the customer.  
Normally value is created either through  use (e.g. driving a car), reduction of the customer's  risk 
(e.g. car insurance) or by making his life easier through reduction of his  efforts  (e.g. home  
delivery of  groceries).  
{Use}  
The bulk of value usually derives from the actual use of a bundle of products and services and is  
created when product attributes (e.g. features, design, value -added services, support) correspond  
to customer needs. In other words value is produced when assumed customer value matches  
perceived customer value after the consumption of a VALUE PROPOSITION or a specific  
elementary OFFERING.  
{Risk} (based on (Kambil, Ginsberg et al. 1997) ). 
Value can be crea ted by reducing the customer's several risks. This can simply be a financial fear  
that the price of a purchased good will go down in the future or that the price of a good purchased 
through a long -term contract might go up (e.g. common in commodity markets ). Insurance  
contracts, buy -back guarantees, and financial options are some of the ways to protect neutralize  
price risks. Another risk is that a product will not perform as predicted or expected, now or in the 
future (e.g. obsolescence). This represents a substantial problem to the customer. If you look at  
software investments for instance, one of the biggest problems is compatibility between different  
programs, operating systems and sometimes even versions of the same software. There are many  
different wa ys a company can address customers' risks.  
{Effort}  
Companies must also think of new and innovative ways of making their customers' life as easy as 
possible. Reducing his efforts means creating value through lower search, evaluation and  
acquisition costs, but also easier and cheaper maintenance, operations and training.  
VALUE LEVEL (CUSTOME R UTILITY) : Measuring the utility for the customer by measuring  
the value level of a company's offer allows a firm to compare itself to its competitors. To do this I 
introduce a qualitative value scale that relates to the value offered by competitors rather than  
using a quantitative scale that ranges from low to high. The measure goes from me-too value (e.g. 
commodities), over  innovative  imitation  (e.g. pocket pc) and  excellence  (e.g. Swiss watches) to  
innovation  (e.g. Viagra in the 90's).  
{Me-too} 
A me-too value level simply means that the value of the bundle of products and services the firm  
offers its customers does not differentiate itself from the one of the competiti on's. However,  
differentiation may still take place through a lower price, which is captured in the PRICE LEVEL 
attribute of the VALUE PROPOSITION or of an elementary OFFERING.  
{Innovative  imitation}  
Innovative imitation  means that a company imitates an ex isting VALUE PROPOSTION or  
elementary OFFERING, but improves value by adding innovative elements. Dell has done this  
when they combined mass -market direct selling of PCs over the Internet with the possibility to  
personalize the configuration of your PC. Tr aditionally, retailers only sold pre -configured PCs  
The Business Model Ontology  
52 and customers had to visit speciality stores if they wanted to personalize their PCs.  
{Excellence } 
Excellence  means that value is pushed to its extremes. An illustrative example of value perfection 
is the  offer of the Switzerland based company Jet Aviation. They provide wealthy private and  
business customers with a private jet service. The firm claims that it can meet customers travel  
plans on demand within hours at any airport worldwide at any time. Of co urse this kind of offer  
comes with a hefty fee.  
{Innovation}  
Innovation means  that a firm introduces either a completely new product or service or a  
revolutionary combination of products and services. Recent research has shown that consumers  
highly valuate  innovation and would be willing to pay for new value propositions  (Nunes and  
Johnson 2002) . One of the keys to innovation is distinc tiveness and impact, which often implies  
changing the rules of the game and bringing new players into the fold who were not initially  
considered to be part of the game  (Chen and Kai -Ling Ho 2002) . When  Diners Club issued the  
first credit card to 200 customers in 1951, it launched a revolutionary change in payments that  
had a tremendous impact on the financial industry. I pla ce innovation at the high -end of the scale  
because it gives a firm a temporary competitive advantage through incomparable products,  
incomparable services or new breakthrough markets  (Linder and Cantrell 2000) . Of course, at  
some point unique value and premium rents to the innovator will disappear, either through  
commoditization (e.g. auto matic teller machines) or the introduction of a superior technology  
(e.g. the fax machine being pushed aside by e -mail) (Ruggl es 2002) . 
Measuring the VALUE LEVEL  can happen at the aggregate level of a VALUE PROPOSITION or 
at the detailed level of an  elementary OFFERING. But by decomposing a VALUE  
PROPOSITION into its  elementary OFFERINGs and by capturing each ones  VALUE LEVEL  a 
company can plot its offerings against the one of its competitor's.  In order to achieve this,  (Kim 
and Mauborgne 1997)  have introduced the concept of the value curve  (1997) , which they later  
called strategy canvas  (2002) . This allowed them to capture and visualize offerings on a graph  
and visualize a company's competitive position (see Theory Box 2). 
 
Theory Box 2: Strategy canvas (Kim and Mauborgne 2002)  
The strategic profile of Southwest  Airlines differs dramatically from  those of its competitors in the short -haul airline industry. Note how  Wouthwest's profile has more in  common with the car's than with the  profile of other airlines.  Strategy canvas  
The Business Model Ontology - a proposition in a design science approach  
 53 PRICE LEVEL : This attribute compares the value proposition's price level with the one's of their 
competitors. The scale goes from  free (e.g. online newsticker) over  economy  (e.g. Southwest,  
EasyJet, RyanAir) and market  (e.g. stocks) to high-end (e.g. Rolex).  
{Free}  
Some companies offer a VALUE PROPOSITION to the customer without asking for financial  
compensation. They can do this because their business model is based on other sources of  
income. One example are the free daily newspapers that are distributed to co mmuters in large  
agglomerations. The income of these papers are essentially based on advertising and classified  
ads. Similarly, so -called "free business models" have mushroomed during the summit of the  
Internet boom, but crashed because of unsustainable re venue streams (e.g. declining advertising  
revenues). Other companies offer free value and derive revenues from these activities, such as  
selling freely collected customer information to marketers. Another completely different example 
of free value in the software industry has mainly become possible because of the Internet. Meant  
is so -called open -source software, like the operating system Linux or the Office Suite  
OpenOffice, that are freely available for download over the Web.  
{Economy}  
This is the low -end of the price scale where a company offers a price that is more attractive than  
the one of the bulk of its competitors. Often, but not necessarily this goes hand in hand with a  
lower value level. In order to be able to offer attractive prices over a susta ined period of time a  
firm has to streamline other elements in its business model, such as its activity configuration or its 
complementary revenue streams. Through attractive prices, made possible because of just -in-time 
production and direct selling over  the Internet, the computer seller Dell was able to achieve a  
dominant position in computer retailing.  
{Market}  
Pricing at the market simply means little price demarcation from the rest of the market.  
Nevertheless, a market price can still seem attractive if special features or attributes of the value  
proposition signal additional value.  
{High -end} 
Represents the upper boundary of the price scale. High -end prices are usually found in luxury  
goods, but also for new and innovative value propositions that still  allow charging a premium  
(Linder and Cantrell 2000) . 
By capturing the two elementar y characteristics of an offering, the value level and the price level  
(Anderson and Narus 1998) , a company can draw a so -called value map (Kambil, Ginsberg et al. 
1997) . This helps defining its relative position in an industry along the price -value axis (cf.  
Theory Box  3). Such a map also contains the value frontier, which defines the maximum value  
(performance of a value proposition) currently feasible for any given cost (minimum price of a  
value proposition). Market leaders will either extend and rethink their position in the value map to 
differentiate themselves from their competitors  or radically innovate to shift the value frontier.  
The first strategy consists in extending the value frontier towards the low -end, as has been  
demonstrated in the airline industry by Southwest in America or easyJet and Ryanair in Europe.  
These three carr iers have adopted a low -frills, low -cost service through which they have become  
the most successful airlines of the industry. The second strategy is to extend the value frontier  
towards the high end, as McKinsey, a strategy consulting company, has done dur ing the 1980s  
and 1990s. By only working with the very best people and only accepting customer projects at the 
highest level of management, they have dominated high -level consulting for a very long time.  
The third strategy is to shift the value frontier. T his means providing the same level of value at a  
The Business Model Ontology  
54 lower price, or more value at the same price or even better more value at a lower price than the  
rest of the industry. This can be achieved through business model innovation, most often based on 
technologica l change (e.g. e-business). Dell Computer is a widely cited example of a company  
that was able to shift the value frontier as it offers its customers high value at moderate prices.  
Through direct selling and online customer services Dell was able to rapidl y achieve a dominant  
market position in computer and server retailing.  
 
Theory Box 3: Positioning in the airline industry  
LIFE CYCLE : A value proposition should be studied over its entire life cycle  (Anderson and  
Narus 1998) . Therefore I introduce an attribute, which has the goal of capturing  at which one of  
the five stages of the value li fe cycle an elementary OFFERING creates value. This can be at the  
moment of the  value  creation  (e.g. customization), its  purchase  (e.g. Amazon's one -click 
shopping), its use (e.g. listening to music), its renewal  (e.g. software updates) or its transfer  (e.g. 
disposal of old computers, selling of used books).

Major airlines  Braniff  underperformers  Executive jets  
BA/AF Concored  In the airline industry the major airlines  converged towards similar value  propositions, resulting in commoditization  and lower profit margins. On the other  hand, the extremes of the curve show  companies which provide significantly  different services. Southwest Airlines is the typical low -cost, low -frills supplier, yet  still provides the basic performance  attributes customers expect (frequent  departure, on -time arrival, good customer  service). Executive jets and the Concorde  on the other end of the curve, providing  extremely high -quality service (flexibility,  comfort, privacy) at a corresponding  highprice.

after its 
consumption, its 
expiry, or after it 
becomes obsolescent.

created by adding 
new features to the 
existing value 
proposition.  Value can be

The Business Model Ontology - a proposition in a design science approach  
 55 Traditionally the customer has been more or less excluded from the  value  creation proces s. 
Products and services were designed by the R&D and marketing department, based on historical  
customer data and then thrown on the market. But through the help of ICT the customer can  
become an important part of the  value creation  process  (Piller 2002) . The concept of mass -
customization and agile manufacturing  (Maskell 2001)  allow company's to integrate their  
customers by letting them personalize or configure their value package (cf. Illustration Box  4).  
 
Illustration Box  4: Value Creation and Customer Participation  
{Value purchase} (acquisition)  
Value can also be created during the  purchase  phase by ameliorating and facilitating the  
customer's buying experience. The first step to improve ment is streamlining the transaction in  
itself. An often cited example of convenient buying of consumer goods is Amazon.com's one -
click shopping, which allows customers to purchase items through a single mouse click on their  
Website. For more expensive and  complex industrial goods ameliorating the buying experience  
can include innovative price negotiation mechanisms, contract management, convenient billing  
and payment or attractive financing mechanisms. The next step to creating value in the  purchase  
phase is improving fulfillment. As outlined above, Federal Express improved their VALUE  
PROPOSTION of delivering packages by offering an online tracking service. Some companies  
go even further and build their entire VALUE PROPOSTION on fulfillment. Online grocer ies, 
such as Peapod in the United States or LeShop in Switzerland essentially distinguish themselves  
from traditional competitors by offering home delivery of perishable food.  
{Value use} (ownership)  
Probably the most traditional and best known phase of th e value life cycle is the value derived  
from its  use. In other words the value that comes from the actual consumption of a products and  
services. The dominant part of the VALUE PROPOSITION is often found at this stage of the  
value life cycle. Some companie s define a core bundle of value, a basket of basic products and  
services, around which they “build” complementary value at additional cost. ABB and Microsoft  
have dubbed this "naked solutions" or "naked systems" (Anderson and Narus 1995)  around which 
they wrap other services. However, as explained above ICT has opened up a lot of new  
opportunities for creating informa tion-based or information -enriched products and services  Value Creation and C ustomer Participation  
A Dell customer can chose from a limited set of electronic  components and compose his own PC or  server on the company's Website. CMAX, a company founded by experienced shoe crafters who honed their skills at adidas and Nike, allow their customers to design their personal footgear over the Internet and get them delivered to their home. Customization may also allow manufacturers to charge higher  prices. In the sport shoe market, Adidas can charge up to 50 percent  higher premiums for its customized sport shoes brand “mi  adidas”  (Piller and Moeslein 2002) . However, the concept of customer  participa tion in  the value creation process is not limited to more or less simple consumer goods.  Through the help of ICT manufacturers can go as far as abandoning their attempts to understand user  needs in detail and let their customers design their own products and service by giving them appropriate toolkits to do this  (von Hippel 2001) . The chip industry in the early 1980s, for example, has been  completely transformed by an innovative company called LSI Logic  (Thomke and von Hippel 2002 ). Through user -friendly toolkits they let their customers test chip designs, using simulation and digital  prototypes. The market for such custom -integrated circuits reached about $15 billion in 2000. Another  illustrative example is the one of BBA, now called International Flavors and Fragrances. The company developed an Internet -based tool containing a large data -base of flavor profiles. A customer can select  and manipulate that information on a computer screen and send his new design directly to an automated machine that will manufacture a sample within minutes (Thomke and von Hippel 2002) .

56 (Evans and Wurster 1997) .  
{Value renewal} (ownership)  
In some cases it can be interesting to  renew  value after or during its consumption. This can be  
necessary when value is used up (e.g. an empty phone card), expires (e.g. expiry of a magazine  
subscription), becomes obsolescent (e.g. outdated machinery) or is disfunctional (e.g. need for a  
car ser vice). Sometimes it may also be interesting to create additional value  by adding new  
features to an existing value proposition (e.g. new titles for a game console). Finally, value  
renewal could also mean gradually updating value, as it is very common for software products  
where software patches, general updates or major upgrades to newer versions increase customer  
value.  
{Value transfer} (retirement)  
At this last stage of the value life cycle, the customer has the possibility to  transfers the value he  
has acquired. He may want to do this because the VALUE PROPOSITION has lost value for him, 
but he can still gain something by transferring this value. Amazon.com, for example, lets its  
customers sell their used books over the same Website they sell new books from. In other cases  
value may become a burden after its consumption, because it has do be disposed. This is the case 
for refrigerators, computers and batteries, where sellers offer to take charge of disposal.  
Similar to a VALUE PROPOSITION's overall price,  every  elementary OFFERING equally  
comes at a specific price. But often  elementary OFFERINGs are for free because they have the  
sole function of complementing and making a core  elementary OFFERING more attractive. The  
VALUE PROPOSITION of an online booksel ler, for instance, is composed of a multitude of  
elementary OFFERINGs, such as the large range of books, personalized book recommendations,  
excerpts and book critics. But the only costs the customer finally has to bear is the book price and 
probably delive ry charges. However, it makes a lot of sense to price  elementary OFFERINGs 
because it allows a better comparison to the competitors' set of  elementary OFFERINGs that may 
be priced differently . Also, companies increasingly start to offer so -called "naked so lutions" or  
"naked systems" (i.e. core elementary OFFERINGs) to which customers can add further features  
according to their requirements (i.e. complementary  elementary OFFERINGs) at an additional  
cost (Anderson and Narus 1995) . This essentially allows firms to offer cheaper core VALUE  
PROPOSITIONs.  
4.2.3  Analyzing Value Propositions - the Case of easyMoney.com  
The main go al of conceptualizing VALUE PROPOSITIONs and decomposing them into their  
elementary OFFERINGs is a better understanding of the value a firm offers to its customers and  
the possibility to compare them to a competitor's VALUE PROPOSITION. Further, it allows  a 
firm to understand where it could innovate and use ICT to add new information -based value  
components. The strategic tools we can derive from this conceptualization are the strategy canvas 
(Kim and Mauborgne 2002) , the value map  (Kambil, Ginsberg et al. 1997)  and a combination of  
the two, by also cons idering the entire value life cycle. I illustrate this with a mini case in the  
credit card industry.  
easyMoney.com is a credit card company founded by Haji -Ioannou who has also created easyJet,  
easyCar, easyInternetCafé, easyValue.com and easyCinema.com. I ts value proposition consists of 
customized credit cards at attractive prices. Through transparent pricing, clear product offerings,  
the use of ICT and avoiding cross -subsidies between products and customers the credit card client 
only pays for what he get s. Table 22 and Figure 25 give an overview of the core elementary  
OFFERINGs of easyMoney.com. The data has been collected from the easyMoney.com website.

The Business Model Ontology - a proposition in a design science approach  
 59 essential for companie s. The problem is that hundreds of application vendors praise the merits  
and miracles of their CRM software (see  Figure 28 for IT use in customer relations).  
Consequently, CEO's and CIO's sometimes tend to reduce managing customer  relationships to a  
problem that can be resolved by technology. Rather, they should perceive customer relationships  
and CRM as a conceptual management problem that can be resolved with the assistance of IT.  
Therefore managers should consider a conceptual ap proach to customer relationship as I do in the 
customer relationship pillar of the business model ontology. This will help understanding the  
essence of and the relation between a company's value proposition, target customer segments,  
distribution channels  and the actual customer interactions. This understanding is particularly  
important in a time where e-business multiplies the number of channels, intermediaries and  
customer interactions and therefore causes more complexity.  
The customer relationship eleme nt refers to the way a firm goes to market, how it actually  
reaches its customers and how it interacts with them.  ICT has traditionally had a very strong  
influence on the ways companies organize their customer relationships. The use of databases for  
managi ng customer related information, the introduction of scanners in supermarkets, the offering 
of toll -free numbers connected to call centres or the use of new distribution and communication  
channels are just some of the numerous applications that have transf ormed customer relationship. 
Especially the dissemination of the Internet has further increased the range of possibilities of  
interacting with customers. Generally, it can be said that the falling cost and improving  
performance of ICT has contributed to th e facilitation of customer -related information gathering  
and customer - and product -related information diffusion.  Data warehousing, data mining and  
business intelligence, for example, are technologies that have allowed managers to gain insight on 
their cus tomers buying behavior and improve customer relationship. These insights are used to  
create what Hamel  (Hamel 2000)  calls the positive feedback effect. A firm with a large base of  
users, and a way of rapidly extracting feedback and information from those users, may be able to  
improve its products and services faster than its competitors. In this virtuous ci rcle products and  
innovation can be improved, which in return attracts new customers. Further, exploiting customer 
information can allow managers to discover new and profitable business opportunities and can  
allow them to ameliorate customer satisfaction. As shown previously ICT also helps companies to 
provide their customers and prospects with ever richer information (Evans and Wurster 1997)  and 
offer th em innovative ways of interaction and thus contribute to the firms value proposition.  
Finally, in order to serve customers better or to reach new markets companies introduce new  
distribution and communication channels, such as the Internet or mobile phones , but also new  
relationship mechanisms, such as personalization and trust.  
The Business Model Ontology

Figure 28: Increasing IT use in the customer relationship (Muther 2002)  
Definition : The CUSTOMER  INTERFACE  covers all customer related aspects. This comprises  
the choice of a firm’s TARGET CUSTOMERs, the CHANNELs through which it gets in touch  
with them and the kind of RELATIONSH IPs the company wants to establish with its customers.  
The CUSTOMER  INTERFACE  describes how and to whom it delivers its VALUE  
PROPOSITION, which is the firm’s bundle of products and services (see Figure 29). 
 
Figure 29: Customer Interface  
4.3.1  Target Customer Element  
The TARGET CUSTOMER is the second element of the business model ontology. Selecting a  
company's target customers is all about segmentation. Effe ctive segmentation enables a company  
to allocate investment resources to target customers that will be most attracted by  its value  
proposition. The most general distinction of target customers exists between business and/or  
individual customers, commonly  referred to as business -to-business (B2B) and business -to-
consumer (B2C).  The TARGET CUSTOMER definition will also help a firm define through  
which channels it effectively wants to reach its clients.

Table 23: Target Customer  
Segmentation has a long history and goes back to the 1950s (Winter, 1984). But even nowadays, 
in the one -to-one marketing era, where  customers can potentially be addressed one by one,  
market segmentation keeps its value. In fact, ICT helps companies make the strategic choice to  
target their market at any level between “mass” and “one -to-one by balancing revenue against  
cost (Wedel, 2001 ). Especially post -hoc market segmentation techniques like data mining,  
multidimensional segmentation and data clustering with artificial neural networks can lead to  
more efficient marketing and enhance profitability (Neal and Wurst, 2001).  
With the expans ion of reach through ICT, such as the Internet, companies increasingly target not  
only groups that are geographically localisable, but also widely dispersed online communities  
with common characteristics. Hagel and Armstrong  (1997)  divide these into communities of  
transaction, interest,  fantasy and relationship.

62 and particularly the Internet has had an impact on how companies reach their customers. Early  
predictions of e-commerce forecaste d a demise for intermediaries between producers and  
consumers. The rationale was that lower transaction costs would enable producers to bypass  
intermediaries and deal directly with consumers  (Malone, Yates et al. 1987) , which would  
therefore benefit from lower prices  (Benjamin and Wigand 1995) . Ever since, a debate on  
disintermediation has raged in both practitioner and research publications  (Scott 2000) . While  
disintermediation essentially stresses process and cost issues, it pays less attention to other value -
adding roles of intermediaries, such as brand management and customer "possession". Take  
Sunburst Farms, a flower growing and importing cooperative, as an example  (Gallaugher 2002) . 
Under the name FlowerNet they were one of the first firms to take flower orders over the Web, 
thus eliminating both the local floral shop and order -taking flower networks like FTD. But  
despite early market -entry and low prices for fresh flowers FlowerNet failed, whereas  
competitors FTD.com and 1800Flowers.com can present impressive results. Thi s can be mainly  
explained through the negative impacts of disintermediation, which were the elimination of the  
strongest brands in the eyes of consumers. Beyond disintermediation, time has shown that ICT  
has also opened up new markets and new opportunities , for new intermediaries. These so -called 
cybermediaries (Sarkar, Butler et al. 1995)  or Channel Extending Intermediaries (CEIs)  
(Gallaugher 2002)  insert themselves between existing elements of the chain, aggregating buyers  
and suppliers into new markets and leveraging opportuniti es to add value that address weaknesses 
in traditional systems (cf.  Theory Box  4). Priceline.com, for example, positioned itself as a  
liquidation service for the travel industry. On their website customers can name a price they wan t 
to pay for such things as an airline ticket or a hotel room and priceline.com's brand -name partners 
will accept this request based on their availability. In summary it can be said that ICT has  
threatened intermediaries in many industries, but has equally  created new opportunities.  
Specifically, buyers, suppliers and intermediaries must reassess where value can be added  
through ICT and which functions become redundant.

The Business Model Ontology - a proposition in a design science approach  
 63 4.3.4  Channel Element  
The distribution CHANNEL is the third element of the business model ontology. Distribution  
channels are the connection between a firm's VALUE PROPOSITIONs and its TARGET  
CUSTOMERs. A distribution CHANNEL allows a company to deliver va lue to its customers,  
either directly, for example through a sales force or over a Website, or indirectly through  
intermediaries, such as resellers, brokers or cybermediaries. The topic of channels has become  
exciting in recent years with the proliferation  of new successful channels and the promise of a  
stream of more new ones resulting from advances in ICT  (Wyner 1995) . But this magnitude of  
change demands a strategic perspective that views channel decisions as choices from a  
continually changing array of alternatives for achieving market co nverge and competitive  
advantage (Anderson, Day et al. 1997) . In this part of the ontology I outline the concepts that  
allow  firms to formulate a channel strategy, which can be defined as the organization of a set of  
mechanisms or a network via which a company “goes to market” .  
A distribution CHANNEL describes how a company gets in touch with its customers. Its purpose  
is to make the right quantities of the right products or services available at the right place, at the  
right time to the right people  (Pitt, Berthon et al. 1999)  - subject of course, to the constraints of  
cost, investment, and flexibility  (Anderson, Day et al. 1997) . A distribution CHANNEL links a  
company’s VALUE PROPOSITION to its CUSTOMER(s) and can be maintained by a firm itself 
or by its partners.  
Name of BM -Element  CHANNEL  
Definition  A distribution CHANNE L describes how a company  delivers a VALUE  PROPOSITION to a target CUSTOMER SEGMENT. Normally a firm disposes of one or several direct or indirect CHANNEL(s) that can be decomposed into  their LINK(s).

ICT, and particularly the Internet, has a great potential to complement rather than to cannibalize a 
business’s existing channels  (Porter 2001; Steinfield, Bouwman et al. 2002) . However, selling  
through several  channels simultaneously eventually causes channel conflict when they compete to 
reach the same set of customers (Bucklin, Thomas -Graham et al. 1997) . 
The Business Model Ontology  
64  
Figure 31: Distribution Channel  
4.3.5  Link Element  
While the CHANNEL element gives an aggregated view of how a company reaches its customers 
it can be further decomposed into its channel LINKs. I do this because channels are not the basic 
building blocks of a marketing system; the channel tasks are  (Moriarty and Moran 1990) . By 
describing these different components of a CHANNEL a firm can better observe how it gets in  
touch with its customers compare d to its competitors.  
A channel LINK describes a part of a firm's CHANNEL and illustrates specific marketing tasks.  
A set of channel LINKs together represent a CHANNEL. The channel LINKs of the different  
CHANNELs may sometimes be interrelated, in order to  exploit cross -channel synergies. In  
addition to the traditional role of simply delivering value, modern channels and their channel  
LINKs increasingly have a potential for value creation and thus contribute to a firm's VALUE  
PROPOSTION (Wyner 1995) . Therefore the channel LINK element inherit s the characteristics of 
the element OFFERING because it can simultaneously be part of a channel and of the firm's  
value creating elements (i.e. the VALUE PROPOSITION).

The Business Model Ontology - a proposition in a design science approach  
 65 {Use}  
ICT has had an enormous impact on transforming simple distributi on channels into value adding  
components of value propositions. Actually the term communication channel is more appropriate 
because throughout the channel tasks the exchange of information between firm and customer is  
gaining importance. Corporate Websites  for instance are not only a place for ordering products,  
but also a source for product and service information, for online problem solving or specific after 
sales services. A LINK creates value if it matches customer needs and can be integrated into a  
company's VALUE PROPOSITION.  
{Risk} (based on (Kambil, Ginsberg et al. 1997) ) 
A LINK may also reduce risk. Think of the difference of a customer buying a computer on a  
Website and a customer buying a computer in a specializ ed PC store. The former may buy online 
because he knows exactly what he wants and does therefore not need advice, whereas the latter  
may prefer the recommendations of an in store vendor to chose the right PC. Although these two 
channel functions fulfil the  same role, letting the customer buy a computer, the store and the  
vendor add value by reducing the customer's risk of buying a PC that does not correspond to his  
profile. On the other hand a firm might use a Website to provide a variety of product related  
information that can help customers make informed choices by themselves. A different example  
of reducing the customer's risk is integrating him into the value creation process through  
customization, as described previously in the elementary OFFERING. This  often takes place  
through virtual channels such as the Internet.  
{Effort}  
One of the most recognized impacts of ICT on channels and value creation has been on the  
reduction of customer efforts. Numerous companies have betted on the Internet as a channel for 
convenient shopping, but not all of them have fully understood the consequences. If you look at  
the grocery industry, Websites for online shopping have mushroomed during the late 90's. And  
even though they provided magnificent consumer -friendly shopping  sites with home delivery,  
practically all of them failed. This is essentially due to their biased business models. Although  
they created impressive customer value through reducing customer efforts, they have neglected  
other business model elements, like infrastructure management and the resulting costs. However,  
if online channels are soundly integrated into a business model they can have remarkable impacts. 
Many companies have improved after -sales through the use of virtual channels. They have  
reduced cus tomer efforts through online troubleshooting, manuals, FAQs or direct links to  
product engineers.  
CUSTOMER BUYING CYCL E 
A channel should be studied over the customer's entire buying cycle. Therefore I introduce an  
attribute, which has the goal of identify ing which one of the functions of the customer buying  
cycle a channel LINK fulfils (based on  (Ives and Learmonth 1984; Ives 1999; Muther 2002) ). 
From the customer realizing his needs, through the collection of product and price information , 
the sales transaction all the way to the use of the product or service, the Customer Buying Cycle  
reflects all possible contact points between a supplier and a customer in the context of the  
acquisition, possession and disposal of the product or service (Muther 2002) . The cycle is divided 
into four phases, namely the customer's  awareness  (e.g. promotions), the  evaluation of his  needs  
and the matching to the company's VALUE PROPOSTION (e.g. sales force), the moment of  
purchase  (i.e. the actual transaction and fulfilment), and after sales  (e.g. maintenance). Figure 32 
resumes the roles of the four stages.  Its cyclical form indicates the ultimate goal of retaining the  
customer after the sales and re -introducing him into the first stage of the buying cycle.  
The Business Model Ontology  
66  
Figure 32: Customer Buying Cycle (CBC)  
{Awareness } 
At this stage of the Customer Buying Cycle the customer identifies a company's VALUE  
PROPOSITION that may match his needs. He develops the awareness that an organization exists 
and that it might be able to fulfill his requests. The company tries to reach  as many potential  
customers as possible by means of advertising, promotions, public relations and partnerships.  
Amazon.com was highly successful in reaching and attracting new customers through exploiting  
the Internet media hype on the one hand and by imp lementing a network of affiliated Websites on 
the other hand. Affiliate or associate programs pay commissions to somebody who refers visitors 
to their products or services and who makes a purchase.  
{Evaluation}  
Once a customer has identified a specific fir m as a potential solution provider to his problem or  
his needs he will want to learn more about the organization and the bundle of products and  
services it offers. At this stage of the customer buying cycle it is important to provide the  
customer with all the information necessary to assist him in his evaluation process. As mentioned 
earlier, ICT helps firms improve reach and richness of the information they offer their customers  
(Evans and Wurster 1997) . This includes detailed information on the organization and its  
references, the value proposition, or availability of products. Besides trained sales forces or value 
added resellers (VAR), companies increa singly make use of multimedia applications that are able 
to demonstrate certain aspects of their value proposition. The advice the customer seeks for can  
be provided either by human intervention, by ICT tools or a mixture of both. The recent advances 
in ar tificial intelligence (AI) and electronic agents have allowed to partially replace human  
assistance in customer advice. However, it is important to let the customer chose between human 
and machine advice by offering him access to personal assistance. Sever al tools, such as Online  
Chat, Voice -over-IP or Web cams streamline the consulting process and may make physical face -
to-face contact unnecessary. But clients do not necessarily rely exclusively on the information  
provided by a company and additionally inf orm themselves through user communities or  
consumer groups. Finally, many companies let their customer test their value proposition in one  
way or another to let them decide if their perceived customer needs correspond to a value  
proposition's assumed custo mer needs.

The Business Model Ontology - a proposition in a design science approach  
 67 During the purchase phase the actual transaction takes place. This includes negotiation, decision,  
contract, order & tracking, billing & payment and fulfillment. Whereas negotiation, decision and  
contracting are very important in B2B  they are less significant in B2C. However, technology  
allows to streamline these steps and handle them in new kinds of ways and through new channels. 
Electronic contracting can make processes for buyers and sellers more efficient, and, with the  
legal accep tance and adoption of digital signatures, electronic contracts have the same legal  
bindings as their traditional paper counterparts. Order tracking becomes an important element for  
customers after the transaction has taken place and allows them to convenie ntly follow their  
orders on the sellers Website. Finally, billing and payment increasingly move towards electronic  
channels. An evolution that remains to be followed is the one of micro -payments where  
customers pay minimal amounts of money for "small" prod ucts, such as newspaper articles.  
{After sales}  
This last phase is probably the most promising one, because it has the potential to create loyal  
customers. After sales services enormously contribute to a customer's satisfaction by helping him 
profit from the value proposition and by assisting him in case of problems. It can embrace  
implementation and use, training, maintenance, monitoring, troubleshooting and reverse logistics  
(i.e. disposal).  
Figure 33 gives an overview of the spec ific tasks that can be found throughout a channel and that  
are grouped by the stages of the customer’s buying cycle.

68 4.3.6  Channel strategy  
Before coming to the next business model ontology element I show a short example of how  
conceptualizing channels can lead to a management tool. The distribution CHANNEL element  
has important implications for management because companies reach their customers through  
various different channels. While the sports brand The Gap owns a network of over 2000 retail  
stores, Tupperware sells its food storage containers through over 950'00 0 independent  
Tupperware "consultants". The car manufacturer BMW reaches its customers in the United States 
through about 300 franchised dealers selling its automobiles, but designs and implements national 
advertising itself  (Dolan 2000) . As illustrated earlier, the computer manufacture Compaq (now  
HP) sells its products primarily through third -party resellers, whereas Dell concentrates on  direct 
channels, such as the Internet and telephone. These examples illustrate just some of the multiple  
ways to go to market, while the advances in ICT promise even more to come (Wyner 1995) . This 
evolution increases complexity and calls for an integrated approach to channel design and  
mana gement.  
The management tool I propose to tackle these issues is based on the Customer Buying Cycle  
(Ives and Learmonth 1984; Ives 1999; Muther 2002)  and the so -called Hybrid Grid (Moriarty and 
Moran 1990; Dolan 2000) . This tool consists of a matrix with the different phases of the cus tomer 
buying cycle on the one axis and a company's range of CHANNELs on the other axis. I illustrate 
this in  Figure 35 with a simplified example of the bookseller Barnes and Nobles who has a wide  
range of virtual and physical chann els. The most important channel is the network of  
approximately 900 Barnes & Nobles stores that employ more than 32'000 booksellers. Under the  
pressure of Amazon.com and other online bookstores B&N launched its own online store in 1997 
and established its  first virtual channel. Shortly after followed a further virtual channel, B&N's  
affiliation program that allowed partners to sell B&N books over their own websites and earn a  
commission. The first truly innovative online channel followed with Barnes & Noble  University  
that offers courses over the Internet in order to stimulate the company's bookselling. The boxes in 
Figure 35 which you find at the intersection of the CHANNELs and the four phases of the  
customer buying cycle represent  the aggregated  channel LINKs of the company.  These LINKs  
are connected to each other inside and/or across different CHANNELs. The first described  
channel, the Barnes & Nobles stores, is a fully integrated channel with LINKs from awareness to 
after sales. The B&N’s affiliation network on the other hand is only a partial channel with LINKs 
that fulfill the role of creating awareness and helping in evaluation. The other roles are fulfilled  
by other channels, to which the affiliation network is connected to. Yet, connections can also  
exist between two full CHANNELs, such as between B&N’s stores and its website. With the  
online store locator offline customers can find physical outlets on B&N’s website and on the  
other hand online customers have the possibility to return the books they bought over the Web at 
offline stores.

Another illustration of a company's channel strategy is presented in Figure 36 where I outline the 
case of the mobile phone manufacturer Nokia, who has a wide range of virtual, physical, owned  
and partner CHANNELs.  As in the previous figure on Barnes & Noble the boxes represent the  
aggregated channel LINKs and are connected to each other inside and/or across different  
CHANNELs. Nokia's most important sales channels are the national mobile phone network  
operators, which sell the bulk of its phones, and, the various electronics or other retailers. But the 
other channels, such as No kia.com, Club Nokia or Nokia Academy (a place to learn about Nokia 
phone features) also have a very important role to play. Club Nokia, for instance, re -establishes a 
direct communication link between Nokia and the final customer, which has traditionally b een the 
operators' sphere of influence. This link has an enormous value in loyalizing customers, selling  
them additional products and collecting information on their behavior.  Specialized affiliate

4.3.7  Channel Conflict  
An important element of a channel strategy in a business model is managing channel conflicts.  
When more than one channel competes for the same customers there is a high chance of channel  
conflict (Bucklin, Thomas -Graham et al. 1997) . An illustrative example is the one of the  
computer manufacture Compaq (now HP) . When it started to copy Dell's direct channel strategy  
in the late 90's  it drew a hostile reaction from its resellers, who correctly felt the company was  
competing with them.  In 1999, the company's Board of Directors forced out CEO Eckhard  
Pfieffer, partially due to his inability to successfully balance the direct and indirect channels  
(HBSS 1999) . In the record industry the  majors, such as Sony Music, EMI or Warner Music long 
hesitated to introduce digital music distribution (e.g. online channels, MP3 players, in -store CD  
burning) because they were frightened of profit cannibalisation, channel conflict and illegal  
copying. Sony for instance, who disposes of a huge consumer electronics and a strong music  
department, could have easily introduced the MP3 player. These tiny walkman -like devices are  
capable of storing and playing the popular digital music format MP3. But Sony was  not 
favourable to the proliferation of its content in a portable digital form and thus let the MP3 player 
market to be dominated by small start -up firms. The record companies’ hesitation to act on the  
Internet was an even bigger disaster, because through their initial indecision to introduce a viable 
online distribution channel the market was soon dominated by free music trading platforms, like  
the infamous Napster. Though record companies avoided channel conflict between an online  Advertising of new

 71 channel and their traditi onal distribution system (i.e. retailing) and though they escaped from  
cannibalising their royal offline profits, their inaction was short -sighted. Many consumers got  
used to the free (illegal) content on the diverse online music trading platforms, because  the majors 
long offered no appropriate alternative. Clearly, evaluating the trade -off between channel conflict, 
cannibalisation and introducing new channels is a difficult task.  
4.3.8  Relationship Element  
The fourth element of the business model ontology conce rns the relationships a company builds  
with its customers. All customer interactions between a firm and its clients affect the strength of  
the relationship a company builds with its customers. But as interactions come at a given cost,  
firms must carefully  define what kind of relationship they want to establish with what kind of  
customer. Profits from customer relationships are the lifeblood of all businesses. These profits  
can be achieved through the acquisition of new customers, the enhancement of profitab ility of  
existing customers and the extension of the duration of existing customer relationships (Grant and 
Schlesinger 1995) .  
Companies must analyze customer data in order to evaluate the type of customer they want to  
seduce and acquire, are profitable and worth spending retention efforts and are likely to be subject 
to add -on selling  (Blattberg, Getz et al. 2001) . Then firms must define the different mechanisms  
they want to use to create and maintain  a customer relationship and leverage customer equity.  
This means using relationship mechanisms to optimize the acquisition, the retention of, and  
selling of additional products to a firm's customers, and the maximization of the value to the  
company of the  customer relationship throughout its life cycle  (Blattberg, Getz et al. 2001) . The  
trend to move from simple tran sactions to more complex customer relations makes sense, since  
an arsenal of new ICT tools has made this possible at reasonable costs. The notion of the  
customer life time value (LTV) reflects this desire to leverage customer acquisition investments  
by bui lding up long -term customer relationships.  
Name of BM -Element  RELATIONSHIP

72  
Figure 37: Relationship  
CUSTOMER EQUITY : I classify relationships according to their customer equity goals, which  
are acquisition, retention, add -on selling (Blattberg et al., 2001).  
{Acquisition}  
It's very straightfo rward to say that companies must acquire customers to do business. Even firms 
with high retention rates lose customers and thus must continuously acquire new customers to  
stay in business. Because customer acquisition is a very expensive affair and because  the 
relationship developed during the acquisition phase strongly influences retention and add -on 
selling it must be carefully managed and evaluated. Take the acquisition race at the summit of the 
dotcom euphoria as a bad example. Believing that market sha re was the main driver of success,  
dotcom companies spent enormous sums for, admittedly innovative, but exaggerated customer  
acquisition. Huge advertising budgets, plenty of giveaways and massive product subsidies were  
common. However, success did not occu r for lack of customer focus and integration in the overall 
relationship strategy. Generally it can be said that customers lured with low prices or initial price  
reductions have a low retention rate, show little loyalty and leave at even small price increa ses. A 
more subtle acquisition strategy is to attract customers with a low price good and earn money on  
frequently purchased components or complementary goods and services. The Gillette Company,  
for example, earns most money on their relatively expensive disposable razor blades and not on  
the razor itself. Hewlett Packard sells very cheap inkjet printers and makes money from ink  
cartridges. Many mobile phone operators subsidize new and expensive mobile phone models to  
make them affordable to customers and cash in on the new services they can sell them (e.g. data  
and multimedia services).  
{Retention}  
The goal of customer retention is to leverage customer acquisition investments. Because customer 
acquisition is normally more expensive than retention it makes  sense to find ways and  
mechanisms to extend the duration of the relationship between firm and customer. Of course the  
focus must be set mainly on the most profitable customers. But this is still not as self -evident as it 
sounds: Most retailers focus their  marketing on driving traffic into their stores by using hot  
promotions, even though the majority of their profits come from a small fraction of their  
customers. Blattber, Getz et al.  (2001)  mention the following drivers that affect customer  
retention: customer expectation versus delivered quality, the value of the good or service, product  
uniqueness an d suitability, loyalty mechanisms, ease of purchase, customer service and ease of  
exit. In this model I only consider the mechanisms that can be directly assigned to retaining  Value Proposition  Target Customer

 73 customers, such as loyalty programs, customer defection programs or installing switching cost.  
The best known example of a retention strategy in the market is probably the frequent flyer miles  
which airlines award their customers with.  
Increasingly, customer retention is also influenced by switching costs. In other words, the costs o f 
terminating a relationship and building a new one have an influence on customer defection. When 
General Electric offered their airline customers to not only deliver airplane engines, but to take  
charge of every aspect of their customers airplanes, they did nothing else than locking them in.  
Admittedly, the airlines were freed from airplane maintenance, but became dependant of General  
Electric. An example of switching costs in the B2C market are personalized websites.  
Amazon.com offers its customers person al wish lists, personalized book recommendations based  
on their purchase history and other features that they cannot export to another book vendor.  If a 
customer switches suppliers he is forced to rebuild all this information.  
{Add -on selling}  
Add-on selli ng is the activity associated with selling any additional products and services to  
current customers (Blattberg, Ge tz et al. 2001) . These products can, but do not necessarily have to 
be related to each other. getAbstracts.com, a start -up that sells abstracts of business books online  
allows its customers to purchase these books directly over their website. Telecommunic ation 
companies and recently also mobile phone operators try to increase their revenues by selling their 
existing customers additional data services. When the Swiss financial corporation Credit Swiss  
Group acquired the Winterthur insurance company its goal  was to exploit synergies by selling its  
banking customers insurance contracts.  
4.3.9  Mechanism element  
The relationship MECHANISM is part of a RELATIONSHIP. It is a specific mechanism that has 
a function in relationship building with a company's customers. The y contribute to  
personalization, trust and brand building.  
Name of BM -Element  relationship MECHANISM

{Personalization}  
Historically, vendo rs had a personal relationship with their customers. The typical example is the  
Mom and Pop grocery store where the shopkeeper knows every client personally and is familiar  
with his needs and habits. But these shops have made way to bigger and impersonal u rban stores  
The Business Model Ontology  
74 with a larger trading area and thousands of employees. Because of their size, lower employee -to-
customer ratios and high turnover among employees it has become impossible for most  
companies to maintain one -to-one human relationships with their  customers. ICT now allows  
companies to re -introduce a more personalized relationship with their customers at a reasonable  
cost. Many firms have established information strategies to gather and exploit knowledge about  
their customer in order to personalize  interactions. Customer profiles with historical buying  
behavior, tastes and needs and their contact history with the firm are stored in large databases.  
This data can then be used to simulate a kind of Mom and Pop store relationship, where the  
customer has  the impression to be known personally to the firm with all his needs and  
preferences. But personalization does not necessarily mean a one -to-one relationship. Rather it  
could mean personalizing for a group of customers with common characteristics, which i s known 
as one -to-tribe marketing. The choice between one -to-one and one -to-tribe depends on the  
relationship a company wants to establish and the cost factor.  
The personalized approach I tackle in this section is comparable to the mass customization  
appro ach in the value creation process of the value proposition (see  4.2.2 ). Whereas mass  
customization is more product related and tied to mass industrialized production tailored to the  
customer's wishes, personalization is more ab out customizing marketing, services and  
supplementary offers to the core value proposition.  
An important field of personalized mechanisms is one -to-one marketing. This is nothing else than 
tailoring marketing activities to specific customers, their needs,  behavior and their particular  
transaction history. Of course a company must be able to collect or posses enough customer  
information before it can enter into a real one -to-one relationship with its clients. Pine II, Peppers 
et al.  (1995)  call this a learning relationship - an ongoing connection that becomes smarter as the  
two interact with ea ch other, collaborating to meet the customer's needs over time. In good hotels 
or restaurants it is common to reward loyal customers with their favorite table or a welcome gift  
in the room. Airlines know when a frequent first class flyer enters an airplane  and a stewardess  
welcomes him personally. But things could go much further. Imagine an airline customer that by  
accident has taken two delayed flights the same week. Wouldn't he be pleased if the airline were  
able to detect this incidence and address him  personally with an excuse letter or maybe even a  
goodie? This would certainly have important impacts on customer loyalty and thus improve the  
bottom line.  
Another example of a personalized customer relationship are product recommendations to  
specific custo mers. This becomes possible through so -called recommending systems, which are  
based on attributes, item -to-item correlation or user -to-user correlation  (Schafer, Konstan et al.  
2000) . The first technique is based on a set of rules that makes recommendations derived from a  
customer's profile of attrib utes. An online music store that learns that a particular customer only  
buys discounted CD's may offer him price reductions the next time he surfs the Website. The  
second technique identifies items frequently found in association with items in which a cust omer 
has expressed interest. The third technique, also known as collaborative filtering and to date the  
most powerful method  (Sarwar, Karypis et al. 2000) , recommends products to a customer based  
on the correlation between his profile and other customers who have a similar purchase behavior.  
The problem of  true personalization is that it requires the integration of several information  
sources spread across the company. Collecting and combining real -time information from sales,  
marketing and service channels in order to better serve the customer is a problem  that most  
industries are still working on.  
{Trust}  
In business a certain level of trust between economic agents is indispensable so that business can  
take place. "Trust of a party A in a party B for a service X is the measurable belief of A in that B 
The Business Model Ontology - a proposition in a design science approach  
 75 will behave dependably for a specified period within a specified context" (Dimitrakos 2001) . This 
shows that the notion of expe ctation is central to the concept of trust  (Jones 2002) . Traditionally, 
trust has been based on identity, assumed quality or the perception o f risk and it deepens over the 
time of a relationship  (Daignault, Shepherd et al. 2002) . But in a business environment that has  
become increasingly global, transactions more and more virtual and where the implicated parties  
do not necessarily know each other anymo re before conducting business, new trust mechanism  
have gained importance. ICT offers a large range of innovative or improved mechanisms to build 
trust in e-business environments  (Friedman, Kahn et al. 2000)  by improving the expected output  
of a transaction (cf. Illustration Box 5).  
Especially the role of reputation has rec eived a boost through ICT. The large body of literature on 
this subject shows how reputation is based on communities, dedicated reputation systems or third 
parties. Take, for instance, virtual communities. They are a powerful but two edged instrument of 
trust. Besides content officially published by a company, the members of a virtual community of  
transaction compare and aggregate their experiences and thus give a perspective independent of  
vendors and advertisers  (Hagel and Armstrong 1997; McWilliam 2000) . However, companies 
have a very limited direct influence on virtual communities and often fear their power. A quite  
similar mechanisms of trust is the survey of a company's performance history stored in so -called 
reputation systems (i.e. the accumulated feedback of second parties). Third parties can also play  
an important role in providing trust mechanisms as long as they are perceived as trusted and  
independent. They can offer so -called labeling services, such as the TRUSTe's Privacy Seal  
(McKnight, Choudhury et al. 2000) , certification services as provided by VeriSign, or  
authorization and verification services.  Further, similar to second party reputation systems third  
party ratings are also a trust mechanism that receive muc h attention by customers.  
SmartMoney.com, the online branch of the well -known investor's magazine provides annual  
ratings of online and offline brokers and a tool called "broker meter" that will show you how fast  
your broker's site is compared to other bro kers.  
More traditional instruments to establish trust are mediation services in case of disputes or  
insurance guaranties to prevent financial loss. Further, technology also plays an important role in  
establishing trust. Often it is perceived to be either  secure or insecure and accordingly has an  
impact on the trust a customer will have in a company or a service. For a very long time  
customers were reluctant to use the Internet for transaction purposes because it was perceived as  
an insecure technology.

Illustration Box 5: Trust at eBay  
{Brand}  
Brands constitute a pivotal resource for generating and sustaining competitive advantage  (Aaker 
1989) . They are an important part of relationship building and help creating  a distinction among  
entities that may satisfy a costumer's need  (Berthon, Hulbert et al. 1999) . When designing  
business models companies should have a clear brand identity with depth and textures so that  
those designing and implementing the communications programs  do not inadvertently send  
conflicting or confusing messages to customers  (Joachimsthaler and Aaker 1997) . Some even  
compare a brand identity and can be compared to the identity of a person. For instance, Absolut  
vodka personified tends to be describe d as a cool, hip, contemporary 25 -year old (Aaker 199 7).  
A brand is influenced by every interaction with a customer or with a firm's environment. This  
includes transactions, marketing, public relations and generally its behavior in society. For the  
purpose of the ontology I understand brand mechanisms as specific actions that are devoted to  
identity and brand building.  Trust mechanisms at eBay.com  
eBay is an online auction and trading platform in which buyers and sellers are brought together to buy  and sell items such as antiques, computers, stamps and toys, but also business and industrial goods. In  2002 the company had earnings of over 1 billion dollars and an income of almost 190 million dollars. A part of its business model are the mechanisms to establish trust which are crucial for such a virtual  platform where buyers and sellers have never done business before. Therefore eBay has installed a  range of state -of-the-art trust mechanisms under the so -called SafeHarbor program:  
Feedback Forum. Every eBay user has a Feedback Profile made up of comments from other eBay users and allows to check the "reputation" or business practices of any buyer or seller at eBay.  
Escrow Service . This is a service co -offered with Escrow.com that protects both buyer and seller by  acting as a trusted third -party during the transaction, which manages the payment process from start to finish.  
Fraud Protection Program . eBay users are covered for up to $200 on most items for free. Further, the  company works closely with their community of members to ensure a safe trading environment.  
ID Verify. This is a mechanism that verifies the identity of a user and helps others trust him as their  tradin g partner. The verification is based on personal information that is cross -checked against  consumer and business databases for consistency.  
Authentication Services. Authentication helps to find out whether an item is genuine based on an  independent authent icator's physical inspection. The service is co -offered through authentication  companies listed on the website.  
Verified Rights Owner (VeRO). eBay's Verified Rights Owner (VeRO) Program ensures that items  listed for sale do not infringe upon the copyright, trademark or other intellectual property rights of third parties.  
Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) . This is an independent service co -offered with Square Trade that  provides a neutral place to work out disputes online efficiently and effectively.  
eBay Pay ments Policy . eBay offers buyers  full purchase protection for both credit card and electronic  check payments. Sellers  are also protected  from chargeback resulting from fraudulent transactions.

4.3.10  Mini -Case Orange  
In this section I apply the relationship elements outlined in the previous lines to a mini -case in the 
mobile phone industry. Orange is  one of the three mobile telecommunication operators in  
Switzerland and is a 100% subsidiary of France Télécom. With about 1'600 employees, 78 points 
of sale and its Network that covers 98% of the Swiss population it makes a turnover of CHF475  
million and an EBIDTA of CHF33 million. Besides building and maintaining its networks,  
managing customer contracts belongs to Orange’s main business tasks. In the following I outline  
a part of the company’s relationship strategy in acquisition, retention and add -on sel ling by using 
the framework described in this chapter. The case is illustrated in  Figure 38. The columns  
represent the RELATIONSHIP MECHANISMs of Orange and the lines represent their attributes, 
the related CHANNELS and TARGET CUST OMERs. It remains to be said that besides the  
elements outlined below, Orange maintains a number of sponsorships, such as OrangeCinema,  
OrangeOpera and HandyHero in order to contribute to brand building.  
 
 
 Brand building  When Nestlé acquired Buitoni, an old Italian pasta company and brand, they used a set of innovative brand building mechanisms to expand in the United Kingdom pasta market, where consumers did not seem to have a wide variety of pasta recipes in their repertoires  (Joachimsthaler and Aaker 1997). They challenge was to expand consumers' use of the product, but in a way that benefited its own brand and not its competitors' brand. Buitoni achieved this by establishing the Casa Buitoni Club that was  positioned as a helpful authority on Italian food to which consumers could turn for advice on the many varieties of pasta and their preparation.  
Nokia, the Finnish mobile  phone manufacturer, esta blished a  strong brand in the mobile phone  market . The brand is an important but not the most important part of Nokia's business model.  The 
company contributes to its image of a young and dynamic innovator by sponsoring such events as the Nokia Snowboard FIS World Cup tour or sponsoring a number of top -ranked beach volleyball  professionals. But Nokia also uses ICT for branding proposes. Owners of a Nokia phone can join the Club Nokia online by entering their serial number and then benefit from games, cartoons, movies,  images and ring tones. Nokia's branding strategy proved to be very successful resulting in a No.6  ranking in Interbrand's year 2002 list of the world's top 100 brands (Bensinger 2003) .

The Business Model Ontology - a proposition in a design science approach  
 79 4.4  INFRASTRUCTURE MANA GEMENT  
The Infrastructure Management pillar  is about the how a company creates value. It describes what  
abilities are necessary to provide its VALUE PROPOSITION s an maintain its CUSTOMER  
INTERFACE . Infrastructure Management outlines the value network that generates economic  
value through complex dynamic exchanges  between one ore more enterprises, its customers,  
suppliers, strategic partners and the community  (Allee 2000) . In other words, this  pillar  specifies  
the business model’s capabilities and resources, their owners and providers, as well as who  
execut es which activity and how they relate to each other. As linkages  between companies  are 
more and more electronic, the members of a network are flexible in coordinating schedules,  
sharing assets, utilizing each other’s competencies and resources, and they de velop, pursue and  
close business together  (Andrews and Hahn 1998) . The ultimate goal from a senior  
management’s perspective would be a company with plug -and-play characteristics. From their  
point of view they should  be able to divest themselves of one business and plug in another one  
without rebuilding all the reporting and administrative system (Herman 2002) . 
Definition: INFRASTTRUCTURE MANAGEMENT describes the value system configuration  
(Gordijn, Akkermans et al. 2001)  that is necessary to deliver the value proposition  and maintain  
customer interfaces . This comprises the  VALUE CONFIGURATION  of the firm, in other words  
the activities to create and deliver value, and, the relationship between them, the in -house 
CAPABILITYies  and those acquired through the firm’s  PARTNERSHIP network (see  Figure 
39).  
 
Figure 39: Infrastructure Management  
4.4.1  Capability Element  
CAPABILITY is the  fifth element of the business model ontology.  Wallin (2000)  describes  
capabilities as repeatable patterns of action in the use of assets to create, produce, and/or offer  
products and services to the market (cf.  Theory Box  5). Thus, a firm has to dispose of a set of  
CAPABILIT Yies in order to provide  its VALUE PROPOSITION. These capabilities depend on  
the assets or resources of the firm  (Bagchi and Tulskie 2000) . And, increasingly, they are  
outsourced to partners, while usin g e-business technologies to maintain the tight integration that  
is necessary for a firm to function efficiently. In other words, ICT has made it possible for  
companies to "unbundle" and outsource capabilities and resources that do not belong to their core  
competencies (Hagel III and Singer 2000) . Reflecting on core capabilities helps companies  
streamline their organization and build competitive advantages (cf. Illustration Box 7).

4.4.2  Resource Element  
In order to create value, a firm needs resources  (Wernefelt 1984) . In this rega rd Grant (1991)  
distinguishes between tangible and intangible assets and people -based skills. Tangible resources  
include plants, equipment and cash reserves. Intangible reso urces include patents, copyrights,  
reputation, brands and trade secrets. Human resources are the people a firm needs in order to  
create value with tangible and intangible resources.  Core Capabilities at Dell and e asyJet.com  The core capabilities of the IT retailer Dell concern two domains, which are supply chain excellence  and 360 degree mastery of the customer relationship over the Internet or through the call center. The  former allows the company just -in-time del ivery of required components, build -to-order production and thus low stocks and consequently competitive prices. The latter is crucial because Dell does not dispose of a dealer network and for cost reasons only makes use of direct channels to sell its product. If it does not excel in customer relationships it has no possibility to reach, gain or retain customers. The core  capabilities of EasyJet.com are the maintenance of a cheap fleet of airplanes with high air time and the ability to fill airplanes. Both allow EasyJet.com to provide its main offering of relatively low airfares.

Two important features of  generative capability can be identified,  innovation and execution.  Is the capability to listen to and understand the customer, as well as the ability to  communicate to the customer the value -
creation possibilities of the firm, and to do  
so over long  periods of time  Refers to the capability to deploy firm -addressable assets and capabilities inside  and outside the boundaries of the firm. The  resource -integration capability can be  divided into internal integration and  external integration  External

Table 31: Resource  
RESOURCE TYPE : I classify the groups of resources a firm or its partners dispose of among  
three rough categories, namely, tangibles, intangibles and people -based skills.  
{Tangible} .  
This category  concerns the most conventional resources, such as plants and equipments. These  
resources traditionally appear in a company's balance sheet.  For instance, easyJet.com’s main  
tangible assets are 64 Boeing 737 (and soon 120 Airbus A319) that allows it to keep  its fleet costs 
low (easyJet.com 2002) . 
{Intangible} .  
This group  of resources  concerns a category that has gained importance over the last  decades . 
Even though they are difficult to evaluate and accountants are sometimes reluctant to put them on 
the balance sheet, it is  undeniable that patents, brands and similar resources are of immense value 
to the contemporary firm. The Finnish cellular phone manufacturer Nokia has emerged as one of  
the strongest brands of the world and uses this asset to further consolidate its compe titive 
position.  
{Human} .  
Depending on the type of firm people -based skills are of crucial value. Examples include  
consultancies, hospitals, universities and firms that rely on innovation. The Swiss pharmaceutical  
company Novartis and its competitors bas e their competitive advantage on the ability of their  
research teams to create new products, which are protected by patents and generate high margins.  
The American chip manufacturers Intel and its competitor AMD both rely on huge teams of  
scientists in ord er to win the Sisyphus -like “race” of providing the consumer market with the  
“fastest” computer processor.  
RELATED TO ACTIVITY : A RESOURCE  relates to one  or several ACTIVITYies . Their  
linkages have a specific nature. I distinguish between fit, flow and sh ared (based on (Malone and  
Crowston 1999) ). 
{Fit}  
A RESOURCE fits an ACTIVITY when an ACTIVITY requires more than one RESOURCEs  
(cf. Figure 41).

4.4.3  Value Configuration Element  
The VALUE CONFIGURATION is the sixth element of the business model ontology.  As 
outlined above, the main purpose of a company is the creation of value that customers are willin g 
to pay for. This value is the outcome of a configuration of inside and outside activities and  
processes. The VALUE CONFIGURATION shows all activities necessary and the links among  
them, in order to create value for the customer. To define the value creat ion process in a business 
model, I use the  value chain framework  (Porter 2001)  and its extension, such as defined by  
Stabell and Fjeldstad  (1998) . These two authors extend the idea of the value chain with the  value 
shop  and the  value network . The former describes the value creation process of service providers  
(e.g. consultancies), whereas the latter describes brokering and intermediary activities (e. g. banks  
and telecommunication companies). It is in this component of the e-business framework that I  
describe such activities as Supply Chain Management (SCM), Efficient Customer Response  
(ECR), or e -procurement.  Name of BM -Element  VALUE CONFIGURATION

CONFIGURATION TYPE : I distinguish between three basic value configuration types, which  
are the value chain  (Port er 2001) , the value shop and the value network  (Stabell and Fjeldstad  
1998) .  
{Value chain}  
The value chain contains the different activities a firm performs to deliver low -cost or  
differentiated products. The  main activities of the value cha in framework  (Porter 2001)  include  
inbound logistics, operations, outbound logistics, marketing and sales, and service. The value  
creation logic of a value chain is the transfor mation of inputs into products. The main interactivity 
relationship logic is sequential (Stabell and Fjeldstad 1998) . 
{Value shop}  
The value shop represents an extension to the value chain framework provided by  (Porter 2001) . 
Stabell and Fjeldstad  (1998)  argue that service provisioning has a different value creation logic  
than manufacturing. Service providers tend to come up with new solu tions, rather than fixing on  
one solution and reproducing it time and again such as in the value chain. In this value  
configuration a firm concentrates on discovering what the client wants, figures out a way to  
deliver value, determines whether the custome r’s needs were fulfilled and repeats the process in  
an iterative way if necessary. The proposed  main  activities of  a value shop contain problem  
finding and acquisition, problem solving, choice, execution and control and evaluation. The value 
creation logic  of a value shop is resolving customer problems. The main interactivity  relationship 
logic is cyclical (Stabell and Fjeldstad 1998) . 
{Value network}  
In the value network value is created by linking clients or customers who are or wish to be  
interdependent. The firm itself is not the network, but it provides a networking service  (Stabell 
and Fjeldstad 1998) . Afuah and Tucci  (2001)  see the value network as a direct outgrowth of  
brokering. According  them  authors this is the value configuration that exists when a firm is an  
intermediary, such as a broker  or a market maker. Rather than focusing on logistics such as the  
importation and delivery of raw materials and how they are transformed into finished goods, the  
intermediary must focus on network promotion and contract management, service provisioning  
and infrastructure operations. The value creation logic of a value network is linking customers.  
The main interactivity relationship logic is mediating (Stabell and Fjeldstad 1998) .

Table 33: Activity  
ACTIVITY LEVEL : I distinguish between the firm's primary and support activities (Porter 1985) . 
{Primary activity}  
Primary activities are those that are involv ed in the creation of the value proposition and its  
marketing and delivery.  
{Support activity}  
Support activities are the underlying fundament that allow the primary activities to take place.  
This includes activities such as firm infrastructure, human res ource management, technology  
development and procurement (Porter 1985) . 
ACTIVITY NATURE : The  ACTIVITY NATURE  describes the type of a primary activity and  
depends on the  CONFIGURATION TYPE  attribute in the  VALUE CONFIGURATOIN element.  
The three types of configurations, value chain, value shop and value network have different  
primary activities.  
Value chain (five primary activities, cf. Figure  43) 
• {Inbound logistics}.  Activities associated with receiving, storing, and disseminating inputs to 
the product.  
• {Operations}. Activities associated with transforming inputs into the final product form.  
• {Outbound logistics}. Activities associated with collecting, storing, and phy sically 
distributing the product to buyers.  
• {Marketing and sales}. Activities associated with providing a means by which buyers can  
purchase the product and inducing them to do so.  
The Business Model Ontology  
86 • {Service}. Activities associated with providing service to enhance or maint ain the value of  
the product.  
 
Figure 43: Value Chain  
Value shop (five primary activities, cf. Figure 44) 
• {Problem -finding and acquisition}. Activities associated with the record ing, reviewing, and  
formulating of the problem to be solved and choosing the overall approach to solving the  
problem.  
• {Problem -solving}. Activities associated with generating and evaluating alternative solutions.  
• {Choice}. Activities associated with choosi ng among alternative problem solutions.  
• {Execution}. Activities associated with communicating, organizing, and implementing the  
chosen solution.  
• {Control and evaluation}. Activities associated with measuring and evaluating to what extent 
implementation has  solved the initial problem statement.  
 
Figure 44: Value Shop  
Value network (three primary activities, cf. Figure 45) 
• {Network promotion and contract management} consists of acti vities associated with inviting 
potential customers to join the network, selection of customers that are allowed to join and  
the initialization, management, and termination of contracts governing service provisioning  
and charging.  
• {Service provisioning} co nsists of activities associated with establishing, maintaining, and  
terminating links between customers and billing for value received. The links can be  
synchronous as in telephone service, or asynchronous as in electronic mail service or  
banking. Billing  requires measuring customers’ use of network capacity both in volume and  
time.  
• {Network infrastructure operation} consists of activities associated with maintaining and  
running a physical and information infrastructure. The activities keep the network in an alert  
status, ready to service customer requests.  Inbound  Logistics Operations  Outbound  Logistics Marketing & Sales Services  In the value chain , firms create value by transforming inputs into more refined outputs. The process of 
value creation is sequential: value is added at each step (Fjeldstad and Haanaes 2001) . Examples 
essentially concern production and manufacturing.

2001) . Examples include consultancies, doctors, 
venture capitalists and so on. Value shops sell 
competencies and approaches to help solve 
unique problems .

Before coming to the description of the next element I illustrate the VALUE CONFIGURATION, 
ACTIVITIES and  RESOURCES through ColorPlaza, a Swiss company in the photography  
industry (s ee Figure 47). ColorPlaza let's their customers upload their digital photos over the  
Internet and get them printed on photo paper, t-shirts and other gadgets, which are then delivered 
directly to their homes. In fact, ColorPlaza wa s so successful with this service that it is now sold  
under the name of big partners, such as Sony Europe, Nokia or Microsoft (through the Windows  
XP operating system). These tight co -operations are based on a close integration of the  
information systems  of the different partners involved.

The Business Model Ontology - a proposition in a design science approach  
 89 4.4.6  Partnership Network Element  
The seventh element of the business model ontology is the PARTNERSHIP NE TWORK. A 
company’s partner network outlines, which  parts  of the activity configuration and which resources are 
distributed among the firm’s partners. In e-business literature there are several terms arising for these  
new forms of strategic networks in the value creation process, some call them b -webs (Tapscott, Lowi 
et al. 2000) , or fluid and flexible organizations (Selz 1999) , others call them value networks (Nalebuff 
and Brandenburger 1997) . The appearance of such netwo rks of firms in which market and hierarchical 
governance mechanisms coexist has significantly enhanced the range of possible organizational  
arrangements for value creation (Doz and Hamel, 1998; Gulati, 1998). In general, partnerships and  
alliances have bec ome an essential component in the strategies implemented by most companies.  
Although they have been used by some firms for decades already, today’s partnerships and alliances  
have changed in nature. The more traditional concepts of joint ventures (e.g. for  penetration of new  
geographic markets) have made place to strategic alliances that aim at creating and enhancing the  
competitive positions of the firms involved, in a highly competitive environment  (Dussauge and  
Garrette 1999) . For decades already management literature has emphasized the importance of  
partnering and alliances and has produced a large bo dy of literature from which I take two definitions. 
Gulati and Singh  (1998)  define alliances as any voluntarily initia ted cooperative agreement between  
firms that involves exchange, sharing or co -development, and it can include contributions by partners  
of capital, technology, or firm -specific assets. Dussauge and Garrette  (1999)  add some elements by  
defining alliances as links formed between two  - or more  - independent companies which choose to  
carry ou t a project or specific activity jointly by coordinating the necessary skills and resources rather  
than pursuing the project or activity on their own, taking on all the risks and confronting competition  
alone or merging their operations or acquiring and di vesting entire business units. To better understand 
co-operation and partnering Child and Faulkner  (1998)  propose drawing insights from economics,  
game theory, strategic -management theory, and organization theory.

Figure 48: Partnership  
The origins of partnering and alliances can be found in transaction cost economics (TCE)  (Coase 
1937; Williamson 1975) . The basic idea behind TCE is that economic decisions can not be made on  
the basis of production costs alone, but com panies must further consider the cost of transactions  
through the market or inside the company. This provides a powerful framework with which firms  
identify intermediary situations in which alliances are more efficient than either turning to the market  
or internalizing transactions (Dussauge and Garrette 1999) . However, this perspective on partnerships  
puts the spotlight mainly on optimization through alliances where companies focus on their core  
competencies and rely on partner networks and outsourcing for other non -core competencies and  
activities (cf. Illustration Box 8).  
 
Illustration Box 8: Outsourcing  
A second perspective based on the so -called resource -based view of the firm highlights the  
contribution of partnering for acquiring resources that the firm does not  possess.  This may include  
such broad resources as a large customer database, a powerful brand name or simply patents and  
technology that a firm does not possess (cf. Illustration Box 9).  
 
Illustration Box 9: Acquiring resources  
A third perspective on partnering and co -operation that is closely linked to the resource -base view  
focuses on organizational learning (cf. Illustration Box 10).  Partnering for customer acquisition  
On the Internet or in the mobile phone industry content providers partner with portals respectively telecommunication operators because they have a large customer base. ColorPlaza, a Swiss provider of digital image printing services for amateur photographers, partners with powerful brands like Sony,  Microsoft, Nokia and Agfa because of their br and name and their customer base.  Outsourcing in the financia l sector  Many financial firms, such as GE Capital have outsourced activities covering finance and accounting or remote -marketing to places like India. GE Capital already employs 13’000 people there  (Economist 2003) . Standard Chartered, the largest foreign bank in India even wants to go a step further become the back office for many of the bank’s operations in 56 countries. Evalueserve, an Indian company that was founded by former executives from McKinsey and IBM, provides research an analysis to banks,  venture capitalists and consultants. SmartAnalyst, another Indian company, can already call four of the top ten American investment banks their clients for their tailored internet -based research service  (Economist 2003) .

A fourth perspective on partnering emphasizes the acquisition of markets, but also the creation from  
the scratch of completely new markets. Whereas the f ormer, more traditional strategy has already been 
exploited for many years in the form of joint ventures to conquer foreign markets, the latter is rooted  
mainly in contemporary markets. Even partnering between competitors in order to create new markets  
or to achieve common standards is not uncommon today. This so -called co -opetition (Brandenburger 
and Nalebuff 1996)  is a combination of competition and cooperation, which is linked to the increased  
risk and capital investments that characterize today’s competitive landscape.  Furthermore , because  
many of today’s technologies are based on network externalities  (Katz and Shapiro 1985)  and the  
winner often tak es all  it is advantageous to form a consortia of partners (cf. . Illustration Box 11). 
 
Illustration Box 11: Co-opetition  Partnering to share risks in developing new markets  Remember the video format Betamax that has lost out to VHS or the computer operating system (OS)  Macintosh that only plays a very minor role beside Microsoft’s Windows. To avoid this kind of battle a large number of actors in the mobile industry have partnered to create Symbian, an OS for cellular  phones. Still, another two OS’ compete in this market, namely Microsoft’s Windows and the open  source software Linux and it remains to be seen if the winter takes all. Yet an illustrative example that  demonstrates that co -opetition can be  advantageous  is the European mobile telecommunication  industry. In Europe, governments have agreed on adopting a common communication standard,  the Global System for Mobile communication (GSM). This has given the then still young mobile phone  industry a large boost and created a huge new market. In America on the contrary, there has been no  standard in the mobile industry. They primarily relied on market forces. This has led to the proliferation of several incompatible standards and hindered the growth of the mobile telecommunication market in  the United States. Another famous example of partnering for creating or at least boosting a market is  the alliance between Microsoft and the chip manufacturer Intel. Intel’s chief executive Andy Grove’s  strategy was (and still is) to continuously push his customers to the next level of technology through  partnering with processor -intensive software makers. Intel has created alliances with Microsoft for its  OS, with Hollywood’s Creative Artists to produce virtual reality video games for the PC, it has invested in ProShare for desktop video conferencing and it has formed an alliance with the telecommunication  provider MCI to get more fiber and capacity into company networks  (Nalebuff and Brandenburger  1997) .  Partnering to acquire knowledge  
General Motors and Toyota set up an alliance where they created a jointly owned plant in order  to 
replicate Toyota's manufacturing system in the US market. One of the main objectives of the alliance  was to transfer certain Japanese management skills to General Motors and, conversely, to help Toyota  acquire knowledge about the US market (Dussauge and Garrette 1999) .

4.4.7  Agreement Element  
Because partnerships are voluntarily initiated cooperative  arrangement  between two or more  
independent companies to carry out a an activity jointly they are based on a commonly negotiated  
terms and conditions.  This is the reason I introduce the AGREEMENT sub -element. It aims at  
explaining the motivation, function and conditions of an arrangement between business partners.  Agora  Alliance

VALUE INTEGRATION  CONTROL  Self-organizing 
Hierarchical Low High B-Webs  (Tapscott, Ticoll et al. 200 0) 
Tapscott et al. (2000) distinguish between five types of value networks, which differ in their degree of economic control and value integration. They call this types B-Webs. The first one, the so -called Agora  facilitates exchange between buyers and  sellers, who jointly discover a price through on  -the-
spot negotiations (e.g. eBay). In the second type, the  Aggregation  B-Web, one company leads in  hierarchical fashion, positioning itself as a value -adding intermediary between producers and  customers (e. g. Amazon.com). In the third B -Web, the Value Chain, a context provider structures and directs the network to produce highly integrated value propositions (e.g. Dell). The fourth network,  the Alliance , strives for high value integration without hierarchical control (e.g. Linux). The last type, Distributive Networks  keep the economy alive and mobile (e.g. FedEx).  
Hierarchical.  Hierarchical networks have a dominant player, which leads value proposition, pricing and flow of  transaction. For example, General Motors designs and leads the integrated supply networks to  produce preconceived products.  
Self-organizing . 
In self -organized networks there is no dominant player. The market and its dynamics define the value and price of goods and services. In the open -source software movement, there is no management -
imposed blueprint, because the product evolves through an organic development process.  
High value integration . 
A high degree of value integration means facilitating the production of a specific product or service by integrating value contributions from multiple sources. Dell achieves a high value integration by  partnering with a number of suppliers and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to receive  components and transform them into computers.  
Low value integ ration . A low degree of value integration means focusing on selection; that is, providing a basket of choices rather than a single integrated solution. Ingram Micro, which is a leading wholesaler of computer  hardware and software, partners with over 1500 manufacturers and simply integrates their products  into its offering.

REASONING : Companies engage in partnershi ps for specific reasons. This attribute describes the  
firm’s motivation to conclude a partner agreement. I distinguish between three rough categories of  
motivation; these are  either optimization and economies of scale, reduction of risk and uncertainty  or 
finally acquisition of resources  (cf.. Illustration Box 12). 
{Optimization and economies of scale}  
The goal behind many partner agreements is the optimization of a company’s operations. This can take 
the form of outsourcing (i.e. make or buy), but also shared infrastructure  (Lu 2001) . By entering these  
agreements a firm can profit of its partner's or supplier's economies of scale or of it's specialized  
knowledge, which it could not achieve on its own.  
{Reduction of risk and uncertainty}  
In a com petitive environment that is characterized by uncertainty and high risk partnerships can  
increase anticipation and thus reduce the risk premium  (Mariti and Smiley 1983) . Companies can’t  
afford launching costly experiments in the field anymore, because they have become too expensive  
and prefer engaging in temporary alliances with competitors (i.e. co -opetition) (Brandenburger and 
Nalebuff 1996) .  
{Acquisition of resources}  
As described above firms must reflect on what kind of partner resources could leverage their business  
model and their own competencies.  One frequent form of resource acquisition are partnerships to  
conquer foreign markets.  But many other types of partnerships exist in this domain, such as  
knowledge acquisition, data, or customer access.

STRATEG IC IMPORTANCE  {0-5}: The strategic importance of a partnership how relevant a  
relationship is to the business success of a company. The more strategic a partnership the higher the  
score, which goes from 0 to 5.  
DEGREE OF COMPETITIO N {0-5}: The degree of competition indicates if the partner with whom  
the firm has signed an AGREEMENT is a competitor or not. Partnerships between competitors in one  
domain while they compete in others are quite common today as outlined above.  
DEGREE OF INTEGRATIO N {0-5}: The de gree of integration measures how closely two ACTORS  
are linked together. This can differ from one type of partnership and agreement to another. The loosest 
link between two ACTORS is through independent third -party marketplaces (e.g. stock markets) and  
the closest link are tightly integrated supply chains (e.g. traditional EDI). Of course the frontier is  
unclear and there are plenty of cases situated between these two extremes. MarketSite, Commerce  
One's online marketplace has customized catalogs for Schlum berger, an American oil exploration  
company with the prices and product offering the company prenegotiated with vendors  (Ovans 2000) . 
Private cataloging is favored in transactional purchasing, where the reason for joining on -line markets  
is to reduce opera ting costs (Dai and Kauffman 2002) .  {Optimization and economies of scale}  In the apparel industry, the big player's like Benetton, The Gap or Hennes & Mauritz rely heavily on  partners for their supply and production networ k (Camuffo, Romano et al. 2001). However, they apply  different models. Benetton builds on a strong upstream vertical integration through its 32 production centers for strategic and capital intensive activities (weaving, cutting, dyeing) and out sources  production of clothes (sewing) to a network of small and midsize enterprises that are directly controlled by the production centers. Benetton's competitors on the other hand rely on complete outsourcing. An  example of shared infrastructure is the alliance between the Swedish car manufacturer Volvo and  Renault of France in 1990. To stay competitive they initiated joint cooperation in R&D, design and  procurem ent, as well as in manufacturing components for cars, trucks and buses (Mason 1993) . 
{Reduction of risk and uncertainty}  
In the wireless industry a number of leaders  started a cooperation  in 1998 to create an open standard OS for data -enabled mobile phones  in order to limit risk and uncertainty. Jointly, Ericsson, Nokia,  Panasonic, Motorola, Psion, Samsung Electronics and Siemens set up a collectively owned software  licensing company called Symbian. By doing  this they avoided risking a balkanized mobile telephony  market with incompatible operating systems, decreased R&D costs and reduced uncertainty. The  players had a strong incentive to cooperate on the OS in order to profit from increasing returns of  network  externalities and compete on other grounds.  
{Acquisition of resources}  
In 1992, Playboy, a famous magazine form men decided to set up a joint -venture with VIPress, a Polish press group, to launch its Polish edition (Dussauge and Garrette 1999). RiverOne, an online market for electronics parts sells knowledge to support buying decisions. Using the firm's  on-line research center, electrical engineers can view product specification, learn how to use components, and compare  alternatives across an aggregate catalog of some 7 million parts  (Dai and Kauffman 2002). Instill  Corporation, an electronic market for the food services industry not only helps restaurant chain  operators improve procurement, but also standardize and integrate purchase data, which enables buyers to understand how their expenses were allocated across different purchase areas  (Dai and Kauffman  2002) .

4.5  FINANCIAL ASPECTS  
FINANCIAL ASPECTS  is the last block of our framework: It is transversal because all other pillars  
influence it. This block is the outcome of the rest of the business model's configuration. FINANCIAL  
ASPECTS is composed of the company’s REVENUE MODEL and its COST STRUCTURE.  
Together they determine the firm’s profit - or loss -making logic and therefore its ability to survive in  
competition.  
 
Figure 49: Financial Aspects  
4.5.1  Revenue Model Element  
The REVENUE MODEL  is the eighth element of the business model ontology and it  measures the  
ability of a firm to translate the value it offers its customers into money and incoming revenue streams. 
A firm’s REVENUE MODEL can be composed of different revenue streams that can all have differ ent 
pricing mechanisms.  Integrating partnerships  
An example of a  type of  closely integrated relationship between two companies can be found in the  retailing business. Because ICT has lowered coordination and transaction costs and facilitated the flows of information, many retailers have introduced a concept called Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI).  This is a process where the supplier generates orders for his customer based on demand information  sent electronically by the customer. This means that the buyer completely transfers supply management to his supplier, who controls the stock of the buyer and refurnishes automatically, when necessary.  Benefits comprise lower inventory for supplier and customer, lower administrative costs and increased  sales (Hall 2000) . 
VMI makes sense for economical reasons, but it also means that a firm shifts responsibility, authority  and hence knowledge about replenishment to its supplier and therefore enters a dependent relationship  (Tanskanen, Holstr öm et al. 2002) . When the American no -frills Airline, Southwest, signed a ten -year engine maintenance contract with General Electric, paying GE on a rate per flight hour basis for  practically all engine maintenance it entered an even bigger dependency. But through this agreement  Southwest was able to reinforce its low -cost airline strategy by reducing its capital investments and  cutting maintenance costs substantially (Corbett 2001) .

4.5.2  Revenue Stream and Pricing Element  
The revenue streams a company can capture from its value  creating activities are pivotal to its long -
term survival. A firm can have one to many different revenue streams and each of them can have one  
or several different pricing mechanisms. In general it can be said that ICT has helped companies  
diversify their  revenue streams and has facilitated the adoption of more accurate pricing mechanisms.  
The great variety of pric ing mechanisms enabled by ICT helps companies improve revenue  
maximization . Particularly the Internet has had an important impact on pricing and has created a whole 
new range of pricing mechanisms (Klein and Loebbecke 2000) . In general the Internet has had a heavy 
impact on  pricing, as it has become much easier to compare prices. As a consequence this will  
probably conduct firms to abandon fixed or at least comparable pricing. Furthermore,  these changes  
may bring  customers the freedom to advance from the simple servitude of the price -taker to a more  
powerful position of the price -maker (Pitt, Berthon et al. 1999) .  Value Proposition  Revenue Model  Target Customer

Another important evoluti on having implications on pricing is the economic logic underlying value  
creation in the knowledge economy . According to Varian  (1996)  "the classic prescription for  
economically efficient pricing ---set price  at marginal cost ---is not relevant for technologies that exhibit 
the kinds of increasing returns to scale, large fixed costs, or economies of scope found in the  
telecommunications and information industries". This means that firms will have to increasingl y focus 
on the customer's marginal willingness to pay and apply differential prices (i.e. different prices for  
different customers).

References  (Klein and Loebbecke 2000)  
(Pitt, Berthon et al. 1999)  
Table 37: Revenue Stream and Pricing  
STREAM TYPE : The stream type describes the type of economic activity with which a company  
generates a revenue stream. A company can generate  income through  selling , lending  or licensing  a 
product or service, taking a cut of a transaction  or relying on different sources of advertising .  
{Selling}  
For the purpose of describing revenue stream types I define selling as the activity of giving away  
certain aspects of ownership of a good or service in exchange for money. A record company that sells  
CDs loses the ownership rights on the CDs it sells but keeps the intellectual rights of its content. Once  
the CD is sold it can not generate additional rev enue.  Price comparison shopping  
With the growing popularity of the Internet price -comparison shopping has enjoyed a huge success. In numerous countries and domains Websites and price -comparison engines have popped up that allow  customers to compare  product offerings of online and offline sellers and reveal almost complete  information on the alternatives  (Kocas 2002). In economic terms this means that the search costs for  customers to find an alternative are low enough to make the effort. For sellers this consequently has  implications on customer loyalty. The German start -up Gue nstiger.de  for example, even makes in -store price comparison possible. It allows customers to send a product name to a computer by Short Message System (SMS) through a mobile phone. Seconds later the reply -SMS with the cheapest store and  product  in town follows from a database. An even more luxurious version is offered to those that don't like writing SMS': th ey can simply connect a small barcode scanner to their phone. All this gives the  customer the choice to either go to the store with the lower price or start negotiating with the vendor,  referring to the price indicated in the SMS.  
The Business Model Ontology  
98 {Lending}  
Lending is the activity of giving something to someone for a period of time, expecting it to be given  
back. A company can generate an income from this activity. An important characteristic of lending,  
making it different from licensing, is  that the object given away can not be used during the time it is  
away. The implication for revenues is that the object lent generates an income at the moment it is  
given away but cannot generate income while it is away. If a bank or other organization len ds money, 
it gives money to someone who agrees that  he will pay the money back in the future, usually with  
additional money added to the original amount. While the money is lent, the bank cannot generate any  
additional revenue  on the sum given away tempora rily. 
{Licensing}  
Licensing is the activity of giving someone official permission to do or have something. A  patent - or 
copyright -holder can accord another company a permission to use, produce or sell a patented invention 
or protected intellectual property  in exchange for a  licensing fee . Contrary to lending licensing can  
theoretically generate unlimited income, except in the case of exclusive licenses. Licensing is a  
commonplace way for patent - and copyright -holders to generate revenues from their property  while  
not necessarily having to produce and commercialize a good or service.  
Franchising is a specific form of licensing when a business, the franchisor, licenses its trade name,  
brand and business methods to an organization, the franchisee. The franchise e agrees to operate the  
business in accordance with the Franchise Agreement with the franchisor’s support. In return the  
franchisee pays a fee as well as on -going royalties. This enables a company to expand and distribute  
goods or services while giving ind ividuals the opportunity to operate their own business under a  
recognized brand or trademark.  
{Transaction Cut}  
A business transaction is doing and completing a business activity between two or several  
organizations where goods or services are exchanged for money. A transaction cut or commission is  
the fee that is paid to the party that has organized, facilitated, or performed the deal. Transaction cuts  
are the main revenue streams of many electronic business platforms who provide the matchmaking  
facilitie s for buyers and suppliers. Investment banks are another category of organizations that rely  
heavily on transaction cuts of the deals they make.  
{Advertising}  
Advertising is the activity of telling about or praising something publicly, as through a media (e.g. 
press, TV, web, billboard, etc.) so as to influence the choice, opinion or behavior of those addressed. It 
can be defined as any paid message communicated by an advertising media. Every product or event  
enjoying a large attention is interesting to an  advertiser. Therefore the media sector and event  
organizers rely heavily on advertising as a revenue stream.  
However, as ICTs have made it a lot easier to target specific groups of people, advertisers are  
increasingly interested in "advertising carriers" that are able to address an identified segment.  
PERCENTAGE : This attribute simply measures how much a specific revenue stream contributes to  
the total REVENUE MODEL.  
PRICING METHOD : I differentiate between three main categories of pricing mechanisms, whi ch are  
fixed pricing , differential pricing  and market pricing , which all have a number of different pricing  
mechanisms (see Table 38).  
{fixed pricing}  
Fixed pricing mechanisms produce prices that do not differentiate in function  of customer  
characteristics, are not volume dependant and are not based on real -time market conditions. The major  
mechanisms of this category are pay -per-use, subscription and menu pricing.  
In pay -per-use the customer pays in function of the time or quant ity he consumes of a specific product  
or service. For example, the customer of an online music provider may  be charge d for every time he  
The Business Model Ontology - a proposition in a design science approach  
 99 listens to a piece of music, a car rental agency may charge him for every kilometer driven or an online  
newspaper may c harge for every article read.  
In the case of  a subscription mechanism the customer pays a  flat fee in order to access the use of a  
product or to profit from a service. Actually, in the online music industry pay -per-use and subscription 
pricing often coexi st and it is let to the user to chose between the mechanisms according to his  
preferences.  
Menu pricing stands for a fixed price that is often found in a list or catalog and is used in relationship  
with the terms list price or catalog price.  
{differential  pricing}  
Differential pricing refers to pricing mechanisms that produce prices that are either based on customer 
or product characteristics, are volume dependant, or are linked to customer preferences, but not based  
on real -time market conditions. The maj or mechanisms of this category are product -feature -dependant, 
customer -characteristic -dependant, volume -dependant and value -based pricing.  
Pricing mechanisms based on product -features are increasingly popular since products and services  
become more and mor e configurable. Sellers prefer these variable prices because it makes it harder for 
customers to compare prices. Bundling of different products and services also fall in this category.  
Customer -characteristic -dependant pricing mechanisms have existed for a long time but they have  
known a real boom with the rise of cheap ICTs. Because nowadays it is affordable to build and  
maintain large customer databases with detailed customer profiles, prices can theoretically be tailored  
to the characteristics of every s ingle customer.  
Volume -dependant pricing is less sophisticated than the former mechanism and simply differentiates  
prices on the basis of purchased volumes.  
Value -based pricing puts the customer back into the driving seat and gives him an important role in 
the price -making process. This means that the final price will strongly depend on the customer's  
valuation of a value proposition.  
 
Illustration Box 15: Value -based pricing at Priceline  
{mar ket pricing} (dynamic)  
Market pricing stands for pricing mechanisms that produce prices based on real -time market  
conditions. The major mechanisms of this category are bargaining, yield management, auctions,  
reverse auctions and dynamic market (e.g. stock markets).  
Bargaining between buyers and sellers is the most traditional  dynamic pricing mechanism and has  
existed for thousands of years. But in large and depersonalized markets bargaining has become less  
and less efficient, started to disappear and only  persists for large product - or service -contracts. 
However, in some cases ICT has made bargaining efficient again. The price outcome of bargaining  
heavily depends on the existing power relationships between the parties involved.  
Yield management is the prac tice of maximizing profits from the sale of perishable assets, like airline  
tickets or a night in a hotel room, by controlling price and inventory. It is a way to provide flexibility  
as market conditions change without undermining value in the customer's m ind . Yield management is 
an economic technique to calculate the best pricing policy for optimizing profits based on real -time 
modeling and forecasting of demand behavior  (Weigand 1999) . This pricing mechanism  Priceline  Priceline provides an online market platform where customers can specify their preferences, including  price, on a range of products from airfares over hotels to co mplete vacations  (Klein and Loebbecke  2000). On this platform it is the customer that makes a price offer for a service, such as for example an airfare, which is binding and backed -up by his credit card. These offers are open enough that they can be forwarded to different service providers that will then decide to accept or refuse the offer based on  their current load factor and price policy.  
The Business Model Ontology  
100 revolutionized the airline industry in the early 1980s and has found its way into many other domains.  
Especially the Internet has helped companies achieving a positive impact on profitability thanks to  
yield manageme nt (Marmorstein, Rossomme et al. 200 3). 
Auctions have existed for many years, but their major expansion to a large number of other domains  
has particularly happened with the rise of the Internet. In a classical auction the seller lists the goods  
he wants to sell  and buyers bid in increasing  increments of price. The high bidder wins the right to  
purchase the item. There exists a large variety of different auction types and mechanisms.   Pricing mechanism  seller  Interaction

the right to sell the item.  
Under dynamic marke t I understand a price mechanism that produces prices that are the reflection of  
real-time and close -to-optimal market conditions. This means that a price is the outcome of a large  
number of buyers and sellers that have indicated their price preference, bu t are not able to influence  
this price as individual  sellers .

applied in different circumstances.

customers. It sets a price ta g on all the resources, assets, activities and partner network relationships

activities and relies on partner networks for other non -core competencies and activitie s there is an  
important potential for cost savings in the value creation process.

An account simply defines a specific type of expenditures. This can be a detailed account according to 
accountancy theory or an aggregate of expenditures. Maître an d Aladjidi  (1999)  use revenues, cost of  
goods sold, gross margin and operating expenses to present the financial situation of different business 
models. Further, they split operating expenses in R&D, S&M and general and administrative expenses 
for a more detailed but still aggregate representation.

 103 5 CASE STUD Y: MJF  
The case study of the Montreux Jazz Festival MJF serves as an illustration of the business model  
ontology. Furthermore it exa mines the ontology's applicability to a real -world case and shall help  
eliminate incoherencies. The case study was accomplished through information research on the  
Internet, a series of open interviews with executives and employees of the MJF and a study on the  
MJF and its impact on the region  (UERT 2002) . In addition I have drawn from my personal  
experience when I worked in the MJF administration of the 2003 Festival edition.  
The presentation of the MJF in the next sections is structured according to the business model  
ontology . It is just one of the several possible presentations.. A characteristic of the business model  
ontology is that it allows presenting a business model on two, ten or 40 pages accordin g to specific  
needs and usages . This particular presentation aims at givi ng a condensed and understandable  
overview of the MJF's business model on the first two levels of abstraction of the business model  
ontology. The fully seized business model of the MJF containing all the details of the business model  
ontology can be found  at www.hec.unil.ch/aosterwa/PhD . Below I present a dozen -page -long 
overview of the MJF's business model as well as a bird's eye view (see Figure 52) 
5.1.1 The Montreux Jazz Festival  
In 2003 the Montreux Jazz Festival, which was founded in 1967, celebrated its 36th anniversary in the  
little Swiss city of Montreux at the shores of the Lake of Geneva.  Led by the inspirational figure,  
Claude Nobs, the Festival has become a genuine international venture with a presence on four  
continents  and has grown to a budget of 15 million Swiss francs . Beside the main annual festival in  
Montreux, Switzerland, licensing agreements have led to the creation of "The Montreux -Detroit Jazz  
Festival", "The Montreux -Atlanta Jazz Festival", "Montreux Festival On To ur" and "The Montreux  
Jazz Festival in Monaco". Until 1995 the Festival was linked with the Montreux Tourist Office. At that 
time the Montreux Jazz Festival Foundation was created and since then the Festival has been its main  
activity and responsibility un der the direction of Claude Nobs and the supervision of an eight -man 
strong foundation board. At the same time Montreux Sounds was born, a fully independent  
incorporation owned by Claude Nobs and Thierry Amsallem, to manage the rights of the huge archive 
of MJF recordings and clips accumulated since 1967.  
At its beginnings the  Festival concentrated  mainly on jazz, but over the years  it has also widened its  
musical horizons and offers a range of styles that cater for all the public. Besides its main concerts  the 
Montreux Jazz Festival has become a broad happening with its so -called "off  Festival " events,  
featuring free concerts and a variety of food and commerc ial stands.  The Festival numbers of 2003  
include an estimation of 240'000 visitors, the sales of 94' 300 tickets, the participation of 44 DJs, 326  
groups. 1'200 diverse staff members ensured the proper course of the event and served 140'000 liters  
of beer. Furthermore, the Festival's popularity is also true in terms of media, illustrated by the presence 
of 502 national and international journalists.

The Business Model Ontology - a proposition in a design science approach  
 105  
Figure 53: The Montreux Jazz Festival's Value Propositions  
VALUE PROPOSITION 1: MJF concerts . The main  attraction and VALUE PROPOSITION of the  
MJF are its prestigious concerts with stars from jazz, pop, rock, hip -hop and more. The MJF has made 
itself a name with the regular by featuring unforgettable jazz musicians like Miles Davis, Keith Jarett,  
Charlie Mi ngus, Ella Fitzgerald and later stars from other fields like Bob Dylan, Phil Collins or Guru's 
Jazzmatazz. The 2003 event was starring artists across the musical range, such as George Benson,  
Joao Gilberto, Simply Red or Cypress Hill. This VALUE PROPOSITIO N can be decomposed into a  
set of three OFFERINGs:  
MJF evening concerts . The evening concerts comprise the major event of payable concerts on  
three different stages, the Stravinski Auditorium, the Miles Davis Hall and the Casino.  
MJF boats . As Montreux is  situated at the shores of the charming Lake of Geneva the MJF  
organizes cruises departing in the afternoon and returning in the evening. The MJF boats have 
already become famous for their parties on the lake.  
MJF trains . The MJF offers  musical train journe ys along the idyllic Riviera and Alpine  
scenery. The beautiful sights are underlined with great sounds.  Three trains make their way  
through the mountains  to the village of Rochers -de-Naye and three others travel to the famous 
village of Gstaad. All trains depart and return from/to Montreux.  
VALUE PROPOSITION 2: MJF off . The MJF attracts thousands of people, an estimated 240'000, for  
its renown festival atmosphere at the so -called "off Festival". This includes free concerts, food from  
around the world and sh opping stands along the shores of the Lake of Geneva. This VALUE  
PROPOSITION is composed of a set of five OFFERINGs:  
MJF off stages . There are nearly 300 free concerts on offer across three main stages. In  
addition, there are a variety of improvised acts t hroughout the town of Montreux.  
Montreux Jazz Café . It is the place to be for all the festival goers. The Jazz Café is a free night 
club which features sets from international and national DJ's mixing all styles of electronic  
music. It opens every evening of the Festival  and lets people party until dawn . 
MJF off atmosphere . The MJF attracts people from all over for its great atmosphere at the  
shores of the  Lake of Geneva . A large variety of diverse food and handicraft stands compete  
for the attention of the  festival goers.  
MJF workshops . The workshops have been organised since the  Festival  began, in order to  
offer the public privileged moments with some of the artists that perform at the Stravinski  
Auditorium or Miles Davis Hall  or allow encountering  teacher s of the Montreux -Vevey 
Conservatory. These are free educational events particularly for amateur musicians and those  
passionate about music.  MJF concerts  Festival visitors  Attractive MJF venue

106 MJF competitions . The MJF seeks to find the stars of tomorrow and features the solo piano,  
sax, and voice competiti ons, as well as the Chrysler Jazz awards. The most promising young  
artists come from across the globe to perform in front of an international jury of renowned  
musicians. As for all the events of the MJF off e ntry is free.  
VALUE PROPOSITION 3: MJF frequenta tion. As the Festival has grown it attracts an ever growing  
crowd. To date an estimated 240'000 people stroll through the Festival "on" and "off". This is an  
attractive VALUE PROPOSITION for advertisers and the stands that populate the streets during the  
Festival.  
VALUE PROPOSITION 4: MJF sponsorship . The international reputation and the size of the MJF  
makes it an ideal partner for sponsorships. With its great concerts, large crowd and international media 
presence it gives affiliated sponsors a large visib ility (see  Illustration Box  16 for a detailed view). A  
Sponsorship comprises four main OFFERINGs:  
Affiliation . The sponsor is affiliated to the Festival's visual identity, is visible on all the prints  
and the Internet site. Moreove r, the Festival has a very high visibility in the national and  
international media, illustrated by  502 officially registered journalists from the four corners of  
the world.  
Advertising space . The MJF is visited by an estimated 240'000 people with 94'300tic kets sold 
for the concerts. The sponsor has a privileged visibility on the site through banners,  
promotional booths and branded stages.  
Sponsors' events . Sponsors benefit from several special events organized for them at the MJF. 
Furthermore, they can enj oy private VIP and catering facilities.  
Free tickets . Sponsors receive free tickets and can profit to invite special employees or their  
best clients to the Festival.  
 
Illustration Box 16: Deta iled VALUE PROPOSITION seizing  
VALUE PROPOSITION 5: MJF recordings . The MJF staff includes a highly professional production  
team that produce great recordings of the event. These recordings can be licensed by TV or radio  
station and music producers. Since 1988, Montreux Sounds SA, owners of the Montreux Jazz Festival  
archives, have accumulated a large collection of video footage.  VALUE PROPOSITION Name : MJF sponsorship  
Description : The international reputation and the size of the MJF makes it an ideal partner for  sponsorships. With its great concerts, large crowd and international media presence it gives affiliated  sponsors a large visibility.  
Reasoning : {Use}: An MJF sponsorship contract  gives a partner the possibility to potentially address 240'000 people  and build be co -branded with the MJF . 
{Risk}: As the MJF is an established  institution with an established brand and a solid  customer base the risk of entering a troubled partnership is very low.  
Value level : {Me-too}: The MJF is a mass advertising "media" among others. Thought it is one of the top established festivals the valu e level of a sponsorship with the MJF is comparable to  
other festivals.  
Price level : {Market}: The price level of a sponsorship at the MJF is situated at market levels.

 107 VALUE PROPOSITION 6: MJF brand & franchising.  After licensing the successful model of the MJF 
to other parts of the world the Fes tival is moving toward franchising to assure the quality of the label  
MJF. Besides licensing and franchising the Festival it also exports the Montreux Jazz Café and Jazz  
Club concept to cities and events all over the globe.  
5.1.3 Customer  Interface  
In this sect ion I describe all customer -related issues of the MJF's business model. I outline which  
TARGET CUSTOMERs it addresses through which CHANNELs it does this and I describe what  
CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPs it maintains.  
TARGET CUSTOMERs  
The MJF's five VALUE PROPOS ITIONS target four different groups of TARGET CUSTOMERS (cf. 
Figure 53).  
TARGET CUSTOMER 1: Festival visitors . The Festival lives from its visitors. Every year the MJF  
attracts an ever growing crowd, registering a 10 percent incre ase in 2003 and reaching an estimated  
240'000 visitors and 94'300 tickets sold. The MJF targets a very large range of people that are  
interested in music and amazed by the Festival atmosphere. A particularity of the MJF is that its  
programming covers all age groups equally (see  Table 41). The visitor group of TARGET  
CUSTOMERS can be split into a set of two CRITERION.  
Concert visitors . People that are ready to pay between CHF 40. - and CHF 120. - for a MJF  
concert.

RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT  
The MJF essentially maintains three relational strategies.  
Relationship 1 with Sponso rs & VIPs.  The MJF carefully pays attention to its relationships with  
sponsors and VIPs that it embraces the same way. During the Festival it makes wants them to live a  
unique experience. Therefore, they installed a special host and protocol service. Guest s of the MJF  
(i.e. sponsors and VIPs) and guests of the sponsors are escorted through the venue, have access to the  
VIP zones and bars and even visit the backstage. The service handles up to 800 guests an evening.

were characterized by focusing on acquisition an d attracting new festival visitors it has today reached  
its capacity limits and directs all its efforts to brand building during and after the event. It aims at  
reinforcing its image of a superior festival and exports this image through franchising. {custo mer

5.1.4  Infrastructure  
In this section I explain what the MJF has to dispose of to offer its VALUE PROPOSITION and  
maintain its CUSTOMER  INTERFACE . I outline the CAPABILITYies necessary, draw a picture of  
the VALUE CONFIGUR ATION and show what kind of PARTNERSHIPs the MJF has entered to  
underpin its business model.  
CAPABILITYies  
In order to make its VALUE PROPOSITIONs possible the MJF has to master essentially five  
CAPABILITYies (see Figure 53).  
CAPA BILITY 1: Attractive MJF venue . One of the integral attractions of the MJF is its ability to  
provide a beautiful festival environment located between the mountains at the shores of the Lake of  
Geneva. Furthermore, the event demands the control of a range of infrastructure and logistics. This  
CAPABILITY mainly consists of the RESOURCEs MJF buildings  and concert logistics .  
CAPABILITY 2: Attract and feature great stars and concerts . The value of the MJF lies in the high  
quality artists and concerts the Festiv al features year for year. Therefore a core capability of the  
Festival is the ability to attract and contract great musicians of the jazz and broader music world. This  
CAPABILITY consists of the set of RESOURCES  star musicians , professional musicians  and the so -
called "Nob's Network".  This is the founder's legendary network of connections and relationships in  
the music world.  
CAPABILITY 3: Atmosphere & experience . One attraction of a festival is its atmosphere. The MJF  
achieves this by providing free conce rts, events, good food and interesting stands for the visitors  
strolling along the Festival venue at the shores of the lake. This CAPABILITY consists of the set of  
RESOURCES musicians,  diverse shops , food shops.  
CAPABILITY 4: Attract people . To break even  the MJF has to be able to attract a certain number of  
visitors and sell a certain number of tickets.  
CAPABILITY 5: Mobilize volunteer staff . Because of the MJF's size it has a large need of staff in order 
to make the Festival turn. It would be impossible to employ all these people at market conditions and  
pay them market salaries. Therefore the MJF relies on 1'200 volunteers motivated by the festival  
atmosphere and free concert entries. This CAPABILITY consists of the RESOURCE staff.  
VALUE CONFIGURATION  
The VALUE CONFIGURTATION describes the MJF's main ACTIVITYies and how they relate to  
each other. The MJF basically functions as a value network (cf. section  4.4.3 ) as it connects festival  
visitors with musicians or visitors with sponsors. The MJF is a place that brings music and music  
lovers together in a beautiful setting. A value network has the three main activity types, which are  
network promotion and co ntract management, service provisioning and network infrastructure  
operation. Accordingly the MJF's ACTIVITYies can be classified among these three categories (cf.  
Figure  56). 
{Network promotion and contract management}  
ACTIVITY 1:  Contracting musicians  (see  Illustration Box  18 for a detailed view). The probably most  
important activity to make the MJF a premium event is the contracting of musicians. Every year the  
Festival organization, with its charismatic  Claude Nobs at the head, succeeds in bringing famous stars  
Case Study: Montreux  Jazz Festival  
112 of all musical genres to Montreux. Among many others, the 2003 event featured stars, such as  
Cassandra Wilson, Radiohead, Craig David and The Roots.  
 
Illustration Box 18: Detailed View of the seizing of an ACITITY  
ACTIVITY 2: Contract sponsors . In order to make the MJF possible the management has to bring in  
powerful sponsors that financially support the event. The relationship between the MJF and contracted 
sponsors often goes beyond the event itself. A sponsor is affiliated to the general communication of  
the Montreux Jazz Festival: this can mean a yearlong involvement in diverse circumstances.  
ACTIVITY 3: Ticketing . Selling tickets means selling a service that will connect the musicians with  
their fans and concert goers during a concert at the MJF.  
ACTIVITY 4: Advertising the MJF . Promoting the MJF is essential in order to attract enough people to 
the Festival and to reach the breakev en point. On the one hand this means advertising the concerts and 
on the other hand it means promoting the MJF off.  
{Service provisioning}  
ACTIVITY 5: Concerts . One of the main services provided during the MJF are of course the concerts  
at the MJF "on" an d "off".  
ACTIVITY 6: Food & beverages . Crucial to the atmosphere of the MJF is its large variety of  
international food stands pampering the festival goers with fancy foods from around the world.  
Besides, at the 2003 event 75,000 bottles of mineral water were consumed in which  the hot weather  
and maybe the spicy food certainly played a role.  Alcohol sales also skyrocketed . In numbers this  
means that alcohol sales included  7'200 litres of beer per day (making a total of 2'500 barrels or  
140'000 litres), 8'00 0 litres of spirits, 70'000 bottles of alco -pops and 14'000 bottles of wine  
(red/white/rosé). In fact, some 1.5 km of tubing was needed to pipe the beer throughout the site bars.  
ACTIVITY 7: Commerce . The MJF off features numerous commerce stands that sel l articles like  
jewelry or services like tattooing.  
ACTIVITY 8: Selling merchandise . The MJF offers its visitors and fans a panoply of merchandising  
goods ranging from t -shirts over posters to special CD editions of the Festival.  
ACTIVITY 9: Selling reco rdings . The large collection of recordings and video footage is sold for  
worldwide TV and media broadcast.  
{Network infrastructure operation}  
ACTIVITY 10: Providing and maintaining MJF infrastructure . An elementary activity is the  
maintenance and operation  of the festival infrastructure during the event. This includes a panoply of  
tasks like maintaining buildings, waste management, organizing drivers and much more. For example, 
the festival crowd generated approximately 1.5 tons of litter daily which requir ed 3,500 bin bags (of  
150 litre capacity) to dispose of.  
ACTIVITY 12: Production(Recording Concerts) . During the festival the MJF staff includes a highly  
experienced sound recording team, camera team and director that produce great images and recordings ACTIVITY Name: Contracting musicians  
Description : The probably most important activity to make the MJF a premium event is the contracting of musicians. Every year the festival organization, with its charismatic Claude Nobs at the head,  succeeds in bringing famous stars of all musical genres to Montreux.  
Configuration type:  Value Network  
Activity level:   Primary

 113 of the event. In addition to filming to feed the screens beside the stages, the team produces a large  
amount of video footage of the MJF stored for further use.  
ACTIVITY 12: Managing Jazz currency . An important activity and infrastructure of the MJF's revenu e 
streams is the management of a special Festival currency, the co -called JAZZ. This currency exists in  
an electronic and coin version and is obligatory for the purchase of food, drinks and goods during the  
MJF event. The currency is a means to control the ft, the turnover of stands, and the corresponding  
transaction cuts (cf. partnering with stands).  
ACTIVITY 13: Managing and coordinating volunteers . Approximately 1,200  volunteers in 35 areas  
contributed to the success and the functioning of the MJF 2003. 580 of these were students and the rest 
were either Swiss nationals or EU citizens. Managing them correctly is a crucial task.  
PARTNER NETWORK  
The MJF can only take place because it relies on a strong partner network. The fields of partnering  
embrace seve n areas.  
PARTNERSHIP 1: Artists . Most important, the MJF 2003 contracted and partnered with about 300  
artists including 36 groups in the Stravinski Auditorium, 11 Djs and 49 groups in the Miles Davis Hall 
and 14 groups at the Casino. The Festival Off prog ram welcomed 227 bands and the Montreux Jazz  
Café had 33 Djs. By the way, the artists used the 60 chauffeurs provided by the MJF, making around  
700 trips and covering some 100,000 kilometres.  A detailed view of this PARTNERSHIP is shown in 
Illustration Box 19. 
 
Illustration Box 19: Detailed view of a PARTNERSHIP  
PARTNERSHIP 2: Sponsoring . The sponsors are the principal Festival partnerships. Their alliance  
with the festi val goes beyond the event itself. A sponsor is affiliated to the general communication of  
the Montreux Jazz Festival: this can mean a yearlong involvement in diverse circumstances. At the  
MJF 2003 the sponsors were Barclay, UBS, Heineken, Chrysler, Genevoi se, NAGRA (Kudelski  
Group), Manor, Bluewin, Extrême (Frisco).  
PARTNERSHIP 3: Shops, food and beverage . The stands that open up during the MJF are an integral  
part and contributor to the festival atmosphere. Those situated in a specific perimeter of the ma in 
Festival building actually enter into a tight partnership with the Festival and agree to transfer a  
percentage of their revenues to the MJF. They also agree to only accept the MJF currency, the so -
called JAZZ, in order to monitor revenue cuts.  PARTNERSHIP Name: Artists  
Description : Most important, the MJF  2003 contracted and partnered with about 300 artists including  36 groups in the Stravinski Auditorium, 11 Djs and 49 groups in the M iles Davis Hall and 14 groups at 
the Casino. The Festival Off program welcomed 227 bands and the Montreux Jazz Café had 33 Djs.  
Reasoning : {Acquisition of resources}: The MJF enters a partnership with artists for a short period of  
time. During this time th e artists represent a RESOURCE for the concerts and events of the Festival.  
Strategic importance: {5}: Artists have a very high strategic importance for the Festival because the  brand stands and falls with name of the performing artists.  
Degree of integrat ion: {0}: There is no degree of integration.  
Degree of competition : {0}: There is competition between MJF and artists.  
Substitutability : {3}: Substitutability is relatively high as there is a large number of artists on the  market. However, substitutability decreases from the time a contract is signed until the Festival, as  substitutable stars will already have made their tour schedules.  
Composed of a set of AGREEMENTs : 
• Star contract  
• "off" contract

The Business Model Ontology - a proposition in a design science approach  
 115 PARTNERSHIP 4: Volunteers . Volunteers become partners of the Festival because with their ubiquity, 
enthusiasm and goodwill for the Festival they substantially contribute to its succes s. In exchange for  
their services volunteers get free entries to all concerts, reductions on merchandising articles and a  
daily indemnity.  
PARTNERSHIP 5: Media . As the name suggests they are directly linked to a medium of  
communication and are therefore vehicles for the promotion of the Festival. There are four types of  
Festival media partners: Internet, print media, radio and television. Each has an agreement that reflects 
the specific nature of their network, the frequency of broadcasts and the inherent  possibilities of their  
medium. At the MJF 2003 media partners included Le Matin, Schweizer Illustrierte, Time, Rolling  
Stone, Télévision Suisse Romande TSR, TV5, Radio Suisse Romande RSR, Couleur3, Marvel  
Communications.  
PARTNERSHIP 6: Infrastructure . Dur ing the Festival time infrastructure needs of the MJF logically  
skyrocket. Consequently, the MJF enters a number of partnerships to satisfy these needs.  
PARTNERSHIP 7: General Festival partners . A general partner's presence is closely linked to a  
product or brand. A partnership contract consists of an exchange of services between the provider and  
the MJF. A partner offers and provides their product in accordance with the given conditions and  
receives in return exclusive rights for that product on site as well as visual exposure in proportion to  
their level of involvement.  
PARTNERSHIP 8: Friends of the Festival . The "Friends of the Montreux Jazz Festival Association " 
was founded in 1978 with the aim of providing constant support for the producers and coordin ators of  
the MJF. Recently restructured, it is now capable of directly financing a concert or event linked to the  
Festival.  
PARTNERSHIP 9: Musical partners . Music instruments partners are not just involved with the  
performers or the venues. Their presence  is closely connected to the material that they put at the  
Festival's disposition. They also manage all technical aspects.  
PARTNERSHIP 10: Montreux municipality.  The Montreux Municipality offers the MJF a wide range  
of free services because the event has a  large and beneficial impact on the region. The municipality  
invests around 1 million Swiss francs in the event. Besides covering the rent of the main buildings of  
the Festival it organizes among other things security, waste disposal and traffic and parking  regulation.  
5.1.5  Financial Aspects  
This section simply shows how the MJF makes money. It outlines the Festival's REVENUE MODEL  
and its COST STRUCTURE.  
REVENUE MODEL  
The MJF has two REVENUE MODELS. The first, most important one, concerns the 16 day long  
annual  Festival in Montreux. The second one concerns annual revenues indirectly linked to the annual  
event.  
Festival revenues . These are all the revenues directly generated during the Festival period.  
Ticket sales . The MJF sold a total of  94'300 tickets ranging  from CHF 40. - to CHF 120. - 
according to event and seat category. This can be broken down to  59'100 tickets for the  
Stravinski Auditorium  (98% of capacity) , 23'080 for the Miles Davis Hall  (68%) , 6'800 for the 
Casino  (88%) , 4'600 the MJF Boats  (100%) , and  720 for the MJF Trains  (96%) . {41% of  
revenues}{type: selling}  
Sponsor revenues . Sponsor contracts are an important source of income for the MJF. The  
sponsors pay a fixed fee for their affiliation to the Festival visual identity, privileged visibility  
and a  range of services. {20% of revenues }{type: advertising}  
Food & Beverages . The MJF partners that do the catering and operate the food stands assign a 
part of their revenues to the Festival. These revenue cuts are carried out and controlled  
through the JAZ Z currency. Beverage sales are entirely controlled by the MJF and offered in  
Case Study: Montreux  Jazz Festival  
116 partnership with Heineken. {28 % of revenues  }{type: revenue cut}  
Merchandising . Every year the MJF produces a new series of merchandising articles in line  
with the annually changi ng Festival graphical appearance of which the MJF poster is the  
nucleus. Over the years a number of famous or raising artists have designed the graphical line, 
including Keith Haring and Andy Warhol. {5% of revenues }{type: selling}  
Annual revenues . These are all the revenues that occur throughout the year.  
Licensing of recordings . Since 1988, Montreux Sounds SA, owners of the Montreux Jazz  
Festival archives, have accumulated a large collection of video footage for worldwide TV and  
media broadcast that can  be licensed for a fee.  Montreux Sounds shares these revenues with  
the MJF. {4% of revenues }{type: revenue cut}  
Diverse . Diverse revenues include growing revenue streams such as franchising and licensing  
offered through the Sunset Music subsidiary. {2% of revenues } {type: franchising}  
COST STRUCTURE  
The MJF has two COST STRUCTURE that cover all the expenses of the MJF's business models and  
classifies them among a number of ACCOUNTS.  
COST STRUCTURE 1: Direct costs . {79% of total costs}  
ACCOUNT 1: Infrastruct ure. {20%}  
ACCOUNT 2: Artists . {29%}  
ACCOUNT 3: Food & Beverages . {10% of direct costs }  
ACCOUNT 4: Merchandising . {2% of direct costs }  
ACCOUNT 5: Production . {16% of direct costs }  
ACCOUNT 6: Diverse.  {2% of direct costs }  
COST STRUCTURE 2: Running costs . {21% of total costs }  
ACCOUNT 7: Fixed costs . {15% of running costs}  
ACCOUNT 8: Promotion and marketing . {4% of running costs }  
ACCOUNT 9: Diverse . {2% of running costs }  
5.1.6 Business Model Actors  
A certain number of ACTORS are involved in the MJF's business  model. These are:  
ACTOR 1: Artists . The musicians, groups and DJs are central actors to the Festival.  
ACTOR 2: Media . Media actors play an important role before, during and after the Festival.   
ACTOR 3: Sponsors . Sponsors are involved in the promotion of  the MJF and profit from its image.  
ACTOR 4: Montreux municipality . As a former owner and organizer of the Festival the Montreux  
municipality has continued to be substantially involved in the MJF.  
ACTOR 5: Volunteers . The festival stands and falls with th e volunteers that are omnipresent.  
ACTOR 6: F&B . This includes caterers and the brewer Heineken that take care of F&B.  
ACTOR 7: Merchants . Merchants belong to the MJF off actors and populate the promenades.  
ACTOR 8: Montreux Sounds Records . This company created in 1995 manages the MJF recordings  
database and the licensing rights.  
ACTOR 9: Sunset Music . This company has been created to sell and market the MJF brand worldwide.  
ACTOR 10: Swiss tourism's "Top Events of Switzerland" TEOS . This is marketing alli ance of seven  
world famous Swiss events in culture and sports. It groups the MJF with Gstaad (tennis), Locarno  
The Business Model Ontology - a proposition in a design science approach  
 117 (film), Basel (art), Lucerne (music), Crans Montana (golf) and St.Moritz (polo).  
ACTOR 11: IJFO International Jazz Festivals Organization . The IJ FO is an umbrella organization to  
currently 12 leading jazz festivals worldwide that partner to create synergies.  
ACTOR 12: SMPA Swiss Music Promoters Association . The SMPA is an association of the 22 biggest 
concert organizers in Switzerland that promote s common concerns and does lobbying at the  
institutional level.  
Application Prototypes: BM2L 
118 6 APPLIC ATION PROTOTYP ES: BM2L 
As described in section  1.2 the business model ontology aims at being a generic framework to  
describe and capture any possible busin ess model. Because the process of capturing a business  
model is largely facilitated by  using  a formalized language I introduce the so -called Business  
Model Modeling Language BM2L. This is nothing else than a codification of the ontology with  
an eXtensible  Markup Language XML structure, XML being a meta -language to describe  
information. BM2L can then serve to describe and capture a specific business model. I have used  
it to seize the entire Montreux Jazz Festival business model (see www.hec.unil.ch/aosterwa/ PhD).  
6.1 FROM THE ONTOLOGY TO  A FORMAL MARKUP LAN GUAGE  
As it seemed appropriate to translate the business model ontology into a formal description  
language and as the eXtensible Markup Language XML has rapidly become the first choice for  
defining document an d data interchange formats I have chosen this technology to formalize the  
business model ontology.  
In fact XML already has a strong foothold in business, especially in business transactions and  
particularly in e-business. Many existing technologies are bei ng re -engineered to take advantage  
of XML’s qualities such as interoperabi lity and reusability  (Dumbill 2001) . A mult itude of XML  
consortiums and projects (e.g. xCBL, cXML) intend to rewrite the concepts of the aging  
Electronic Data Inte rchange (EDI) with XML syntax for bus iness applications on the Internet  
(Haifei Li 2000) . One of the most important projects is the joint initiative of O rganizations for the 
Advancem ent of Structured Inform ation Standards (OASIS) and the UN’s Center for Trade  
Facilitation and Electronic Business (UN/CEFACT). It focuses on en abling transactions across  
industries and businesses, pa rticularly smaller companies, generally left out of EDI  in the past  
(Kotok 2001) . 
However, XML is not limited to tran saction purposes and can serve a wide range of other goals  
(Fensel 2001) . XML  is a metalanguage, which means that it is a standardizing format for  
descri bing structured and semi -structured information  for a wide area of applications . XML  
provides a means of including metadata  (i.e. data on data)  in documents. This makes it ideal for  
my purpose of describing a business model in  a formalized manner. Thus, based on the business  
model ontology I developed BM2L to formally describe business models . Contrary to most  
existing xml languages in business that represent structures for the exchange of transaction -
oriented messages or docum ents, BM2L focuses on the representation of a company's business  
model. Rather than concentrating on e-business pro cesses, like for example the Electronic  
Business using eXtensible Markup Language, short ebXML  (ebXML 2003) , BM2L is situated at  
a higher level of abstraction, the one of the business model /business logic  of a firm. BM2L aims  
at making it possible to encode the business model of any given company. Concrete ly, a business 
model expressed in BM2L is an XML document that respects the constraints and the rules  
imposed by a n XML schema based on the business model ontology.  An XML schema is a model  
that describes the logical structure of an XML document. First att empts to formalize the ontology 
in an XML -based language were already made at the beginning of this research  (Ben Lagha,  
Osterwalder et al. 2001) . 
Such a formal representation and the multitude of existing tools to manipulate XML documents  
have a number of advantages. It becomes easy to verify the validity of a business model to the  
business model ontology. Different business models can be compared or can be evaluated to one  
another. Generating different views (such as specific documents) in function of different needs  
(such as descriptions, graphical representations, business plans, repo rts for financing, reports for  
eventual partners, acquisitions or mergers, etc.) becomes possible. Furthermore, XML's platform  
independence make the maintenance and the exchange of business models in heterog eneous IT  
The Business Model Ontology - a proposition in a design science approach  
 119 environments a lot easier.  
In short I have chosen XML for the following reasons. Because it is:  
• a language to describe structured and semi -structured information  
• an open standard (i.e. it is not proprietary and owned by a company) and recommendation 
of the World Wide Web Consortium ( W3C). 
• platform independent  
• machine readable and can be used by different applications  
• reusable  
• transformable (e.g. to different formats such as HTML or PDF)  
• a metalanguage that facilitates exchange  
• a metalanguage that has open standards for visualization (Scalable V ector Graphics SVG)  
Similarly, Fensel  (2001)  argues that XML represents an interesting solution of knowledg e 
management and electronic commerce. The main reasons are that XML helps defining a language 
for describing the structure and semantics of data, it is a language for processing data and it is a  
protocol for exchanging data.  
6.2 THE BUSINESS MODEL MODELING  LANGUAGE  BM2L 
BM2L is defined by an XML schema. It is composed of a nu mber of concepts (called elements)  
and attributes that represent the vocabulary of the  ontology  and the relationships between the  
elements. Together they  stand for  the construction rules of a business model. In other words,  
BM2L defines the semantics and the syntax of the elements. The elementary elements are found  
on the lowest hierarchical level and contain a textual description of the concepts they repr esent. 
The content of each element  is delimitated by an opening tag in the form of <element> and a  
closing tag in the form of </element> and can have a set of attributes.  
To create  the BM2L schema and  to captur e business models  I have opted for a set of tools  
provided by the Austrian compa ny Altova. The privately held company was founded in 1992 and 
has been actively involved in the XML market from the early conception of XML. Altova's main  
tool, xmlspy, is one of the ma rket leaders in XML editing and offers an appropriate toolset for the 
goals I pursue.  
Concretely, BM2L translates the business model ontology's  semantics and  syntax into an XML  
based language defined by an XML schema.  It can then be applied to a real world business  
model, as I have done to capture the business logic of the Mo ntreux Jazz Festival (see annex  at 
www.hec.unil.ch/aosterwa/PhD ).  
Figure 57 illustrates the syntax of a VALUE PROPOSITION's elements in  BM2L (cf. section  
4.2.1  on VALUE PROPOSITION ). In the following lines I describe the XML schema of the  
VALUE PROPOSITION part in natural language, which might be a bit dull, but it will help to  
understand what I have exactly done in  BM2L. As Figure 57 shows, a company can have one or  
more VALUE PROPOSITIONs. Thus, the  BM2L schema defines that a  BM2L document can  
contain 1 -n VALUE PROPOSITIONs expressed in an envelope of a <ValueProposition> opening 
tag and a </ValueProposition> closing tag. The con tent of the envelope is composed of  a 
<ValuePropositionCharacteristics> and an optional <SetOfOfferings>. A <ValueProposition> has 
three attributes, from which one, ValuePropositionID, is its identifier. The other two attributes,  
AddressesCustomerIDREF and  BasedOnCapabilityIDREF, reference the TARGET  
Application Prototypes: BM2L 
120 CUSTOMERS the VALUE PROPOSITION addresses, respectively the CAPABILITIES on  
which it relies.  
The <ValuePropositionCharacteristics>  envelope contains a sequence of elements that describe  
the VALUE PROPOSITION.  These are two textual elements, <Name> and <Description>,  
followed by the complex element <Reasoning> describing why the VALUE PROPOSITION is  
valuable to a customer. A complex element is an element that is composed of sub -elements. 
<Reasoning> is constitut ed by a sequence of 0-n elements containing text, which are <Use>,  
<Risk> or <Effort>. The next element  after <Reasoning> is the  <ValueLevel>  tag, which 
describes the value level of a VALUE PROPOSITION . It is composed of either <MeToo>,  
<InnovativeInnovati on>, <Excellence> or <Innovation>. <ValueLevel> is followed by  
<PriceLevel>, describing the price level of a VALUE PROPOSITION. It is composed of either  
<Free>, <Economy>, <Market> or <HighEnd>. <ValuePropositionCharacteristics> ends with an  
optional <Life Cycle>, which's attribute LifeCyclePhase defines in which phase the VALUE  
PROPOSITION creates value.  
If a VALUE PROPOSITION is  decomposed into  a set of OFFERINGS,  the 
<ValuePropositionCharacteristics>  tag is followed by the  <setOfOfferings>  envelope . A 
<setOfOfferings> is a sequence of 1-n <Offering> that have an identifying attribute OfferingID.  
An <Offering> is composed of <OfferingCharecteristics> and of an optional <SetOfOfferings> if 
it is decomposable. <OfferingCharecteristics> is the same type as  
<ValuePropositionCharacteristics> and contains the same sub -elements, except that <LifeCycle> 
becomes cumpolsery.  
In Figure 58 you can see how this structure is concretely applied when one describes a business  
model with BM2L. It illu strates parts of the  Montreux Jazz Festival 's VALUE PROPOSITION  
encode with BM2L.

 123 6.3 TRANSFORMING XML DOC UMENTS  
In section  6.2 I have demonstrated how the BM2L schema (i.e. its structure) is conceived, how a  
BM2L document looks like and how it can capture a business model. In the  following, I  
demonstrate some of the potential  usages  that become possible once one has seized a business  
model with BM2L.  
For example , XML documents can easily be transformed into a variety of formats, such as HTML 
used to display web pages or PDF, the de facto standard for documents on the web.  In fact, XML 
documents and structures can be transformed to any other structure and formatting. The standard  
way to describe how to transform (i.e. change) the structure of an  XML  document into an XML  
document wi th a different structure  and presentation  is called XSL Transformation (XSLT). Like 
XML, XSLT is an open standard and recommendation of the World Wide Web Consortium  
(W3C). XSLT can be thought of as an extension of the Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL).  
XSL is a language for formatting an XML document, in order to display it, for  instance  as a web 
page. XSLT shows how the XML document should be reorganized into another data structure.  
Concretely, XSLT is used to describe how to transform the source data  structure of an XML  
document into a new XML document, which can have a completely different data structure.  
Figure 59 illustrates how a transformation works. An XML document is fed to an XSL processor  
that will parse the document structure. Then the processor transforms and formats the document  
according to an XSL stylesheet and emits a new document. This process is quite powerful as it  
allows to select specific information of the input document to put into the new document. In othe r 
words, XSLT allows not only to create different output formats such as HTML or PDF but also to 
select different contents of the input document for the various output documents.  
Applying this to the concept of the business model ontology this means that  if one has seized a  
business model with BM2L one can easily generate different documents tailored to specific needs. 
A venture capitalist might want a two -pager to compare different business models while an  
executive in a company may need a 10 page report  to understand a business model and make  
decisions. And the business process designer might want a really detailed 50 page report to be  
able to engineer processes and workflows.

124 strategy of a company by extracting the information on channels in the BM2L document and  
transforming them into a visual form. To achieve this I apply the transformation capabilities of  
XML addressed in section  6.3 to a BM2L document by conceiving a XSL stylesheet  and feeding  
them to an XSL processor (as illustrated in Figure 60).  
 
Figure 60: Transformation from BM 2L to SVG  
The gener ated image of a company's channel strategy is saved as  a Scalable Vector Graphics

In a nutshell, I applied an XSL document (cf. excerpt  Figure 62) to the MJF case seized in BM2L 
and got a SVG do cument (cf. excerpt Figure 63). This outcome can be read by a web browser and 
gives me a graphical representation of a company's distribution channels (see  Figure 61). The 
goal of this is to achieve a rapid  understanding of a part of a business model, in this case  
channels, through visualization (cf. section 2.4.1  on visualization).

Building on the  same transformation capabilities as demonstrated in the previous example with  
SVG one can also imagine the generation of a specific report from a business model seized with

Application Prototypes: BM2L

Figure 64: screenshot of the PDF report  
6.6 CONCLUDING: WHY USE BM2L 
For this dissertation  BM2L has become more than just a simple prototype and  instantiation of the  
business model ontology. It was a truly practical tool that helped me asses the Montreux Jazz  
Festival case study. Having solely worked with the structure of the ontology and a word processor 
to capture the MJF's business logic at the  beginning I decided to design  BM2L to simplify the  
task. To seize a business model formally and to take into account elements, attributes and  
relationships can be quite cumbersome and complicated without computer assistance. But on the  
other hand computer  assistance for capturing business models only becomes possible after  
formalizing the concepts and making them computable.  
BM2L in combination with the off -the-shelf XML tool xmlspy is comparable to a CASE tool  
(Computer Assisted Software Engineering) in  software or process development. Among other  
things CASE tools particularly help to seize, manage and analyze complex projects. Though a  
simple prototype,  BM2L already makes it possible to seize business models and makes first  
modest steps in the direction  of analysis (e.g. visualization of complexities).  
Pursuing this direction further would include the development of a real business model design  
tool with a graphical interface assisting the designer in capturing and designing elements,  
attributes and rel ationships. The next step would involve adding analyzing and management  
capacities. Some of these ideas that could be based on  BM2L are outlined in section  1 on 
ontology applications and further research.  
Concluding, it can be said that introducing  BM2L has made things easier in regards of capturing  
business models. In my opinion further researching the design and use of similar tools would be a 
genuine ste p forwards in business model research, as they could also be tested in management  
settings.  
Different communications ask for 
different document types with different 
information. These can easily be 
generated, for example as PDF 
documents, from the basic business 
model description captured in BM2L. 
These could target:  
• managers  
• employees  
• customers  • investors

 127 7 EVALU ATION  
As addressed in the methodology section (see  1.3) design science must include some form of  
validation of the research outp uts. In other words constructs, models, methods and instantiation  
built or designed in a first step should be evaluated with an appropriate method according to the  
initial goals of the research. According to March and  Smith  (1995)  the evaluation of constructs  
tends to involve completeness, simplicity, elegance, understandability and ease of use. The  
evaluation of  models should be done in terms of their fidelity with real world phenomena,  
completeness, level of detail, robustness, and internal consistency. Furthermore, to inform  
researchers in the field, the new model must be positioned with respect to existing mode ls. They  
also point out that often existing models are extended to capture more of the relevant aspects of  
the task. Evaluating instantiations proves difficult because it is difficult to separate them from  
constructs, models, and methods which they embody.  And finally March and  Smith  mention that  
in design science "evaluation is complicated by the fact that performance is related to intended  
use, and the intended use of an artifact can cover a range of tasks" (1995, p.254 ) .  
In Figure 65 I illustrate how the two basic activities of design science, build and evaluat e are  
implemented in my research. Building is the process of designing constructs, models, methods  
and instantiations according to initial goals. Evaluating is the process of determining how well the 
constructs, models, methods and instantiations perform c ompared to the initial goals an by using a 
set of metrics.  
In this dissertation I essentially concentrate on evaluating the  constructs and the  model (i.e. the  
business model ontology) as it is the major outcome and contribution of this research. Future  
research should  include further evaluation of the ontology and of its instantiations (i.e. BM2L and 
alignment). In  this thesis  the instantiations  are simply illustrated through cases, though this at  
least proves their applicability.

Evaluation  
128 Evaluating the business model ontology can be done through four direct qualitative methods and  
two indirect  more  quantitative methods (see  Figure 66). A certain form of ev aluation is provided  
by comparing  and positioning  the ontology to the literature in the field of business models  as 
called for by March and Smith  (1995) . This  is achieved in this dissertation by  describing  
similarities and differences and arguing why the ontology signifies and advance in business  
model research. A second form of evaluation can be achieved through  interviews with managers  
and consultants. Though this cannot evaluate a model's performance (which is rather measured  
through evaluating its instantiation), it can give an impression of the model's appropriateness to  
perform the task of describing the busi ness logic of a firm.  This research includes a set of  
interviews that have proven to be very interesting concerning business model use and have  
insofar contributed to the ontology's evaluation as they have revealed the practitioners' interest in  
the concep t.A third form of evaluation is applying the ontology to case studies. This gives an  
indication of its applicability and may give a hint on its appropriateness to describe the business  
logic of a firm.  I have applied the ontology to one instantiation, the  Montreux Jazz Festival. A  
group of masters students have applied the overall structure of the nine elements to a set of  
companies Furthermore, the ontology has been used in a masters thesis to model the business  
model of an e-business project of a company.  A fourth form of evaluation is the research  
community's attention given to the model. If the research community shows an interest in the  
ontology this probably means that at least some aspects of it constitute a certain advance in the  
business model domai n.  
The fifth and the sixth evaluation method are indirect as they happen through the ontology's  
instantiation. The former is testing one of the ontology's instantiations in a real -world business  
setting (e.g. visualization) and see how it performs. The la tter is comparing the performance of  
one of the ontology's instantiations with another existing a method in the field. These two  
methods prove to be very laborious to realize and are not covered in this dissertation.

Interest by the research 
community  Positioning the ontology to the existing business 
model literature sho ws which domains are covered or not and is an indicator of completeness. (7.1) Letting managers and consultants pronounce 
themselves on the ontology gives an indication on its ability to describe the business logic of a firm. (7.2) Describing a real world business model through the ontology's rig orous formalism tests its applicability to a case. (7.3) Observing the research community's interest in the 
ontology demonstrates certain aspects of its 
validity.  
Testing the ontology in the field would take place 
indirectly through applying an instantiation of it to a real-world business setting. (7.4) Testing two models' performance would also be 
indirect by applying them to a real -world business setting and compare the outcome. (7.4)

 129 7.1 LITERATURE REVIEW  
March and Smith  (1995, p.260)  indicate that "building the first of virtually any set of constructs,  
model, method, or instantiation is deemed to be research, provided the artifact has utility for an  
important task. The research contribution lies in the novelty of the artifact and in the  
persuasiveness of the claims that it is effective. Actual performance evaluation is not required at  
this stage ". Though the business model ontology is new in its formal approach to describing the  
business logic of a firm it must be evaluated comp ared to other literature in the business model  
domain. In the terms of March and Smith this means that because the ontology builds on and is  
comparable to  subsequent constructs, models, methods, and instantiations addressing  similar  
tasks  it must be  judged  based on "significant improvement" e.g., more comprehensive, better  
performance.  A thorough literature review as illustrated previously in section 1 and in this section 
in Table 42 can bring a partial answer to this inquiry, but it stays somewhat subjective. That is it  
demonstrates if the ontology is complete compared to the existing literature in the domain and it  
shows it s uniqueness in covering all the relevant issues through a rigorous formal approach. Table 
42 and Figure 67 illustrate what elements of the ontology are covered by other authors and how  
exactly they have be en treated. The various authors in the business model domain define elements 
differently in depth and rigour. For example, Hamel's (2000)  approach covers all the elements but 
stays relatively noncommittal on their description. On the other hand, Gordijn's  (2002)  value -
exchange -centric model does not cover many customer -related issues but is very rigorous in  
defining the value configuration and val ue exchanges of a company. The ontology described in  
this dissertation claims that it models all the elements mentioned by at least two authors, notably  
by building on some of their contributions. Its main improvement compared to other models is  
that it se ems to cover all the relevant issues in the business model domain through a modelling  
approach. Yet, this does not necessarily give any indications on its appropriateness in describing  
the business logic of a firm. This issue is addressed through interview s with business practitioners 
“in the field" and is explained in the section 7.2.

Figure 67 graphically represents  Table 42 and shows which of the nine business model elements  
have been used by the other rele vant authors. Furthermore, the heights of the bars indicate if a  
specific element has been simply mentioned, described or modelled. The graphs show that the  
authors can be classified among three rough categories. The first contains the authors that  
mention  a relatively large number of business model elements, but do neither describe them  
further, nor model them  (Chesbrough and Rosenbloom 2000; Linder and Cantrell 2000; Petrovic, 
Evaluation  
130 Kittl et al. 2001) . The second embraces the authors that  go a step further and describe the  
elements they mention in more or less detail  (Hamel 2000; St ähler 2001; Weill and Vitale 2001) , 
whereby Hamel (2000)  demonstrates a very holistic view of the business model. The last category 
includes the authors that either describe or conceptualize the bus iness model elements they  
mention (Tapscott, Afuah, Gordijn) but leave some “business model blind spots” compared to the 
nine elements used in this dissertation. For example, Tapscott, Ticoll et al.  (2000)  though  
conceptualizing the Value Configuration, limit themselves to a network -centric approach.

132 7.2 INTERVIEWS ON BUSINE SS MODELS  
Between June and October 2003 I conducted a dozen 60 to 90 minutes long inte rviews with  
managers and consultants to get a feedback on this research. These were a series of semi -
structured interviews that aimed at investigating the relevance of business model research,  
assessing the ontology's fidelity with real world phenomena (i. e. its ability to express the business 
model of a firm) and exploring possible uses of the business model concept.  
Interrogating business people on the business model ontology is insofar problematic as it is a  
theoretical construct that cannot directly be  evaluated by practitioners as such. To ask them if the 
ontology is capable of describing the business logic of a firm I had to present them some form of 
instantiation. Therefore I simulated a tool that could visually display the bird's eye view of  
easyJet 's business model, its value proposition, ColorMailer's infrastructure management and  
Nokia's or Barnes & Noble's distribution channel str ategy . 
The interviews were structured into four parts (see Table  43 and www. hec.unil.ch/aosterwa/PhD  
for the interview template ). A first part was composed of questions on the use of models, formal  
models and business tools in the interviewees company. The second part consisted of a short  
explanation of the business model ontology  by presenting the simulated instantiation/tool that  
generates certain business model views mentioned previously. The third part was destined at  
discussing these views with the goal of getting an indirect feedback on the ontology's ability to  
present a bus iness model and aimed at getting information on its completeness. The goal of the  
fourth part was to investigate in what fields the business model concept and specifically the  
ontology could make a contribution.  Question Domain  Questions

Table 43: Business Practitioner Interview Structure  
The interviewees included 8 managers from transpor t (1), media (1), services (4), retail (1) and  
industry (1) and 3 management consultants (cf. Table 44). Company sizes ranged from 3 to 3'315 
employees (while the Montreux Jazz Festival peaks at a staff of 1200 people for three wee ks once 
a year). From the companies addressed and asked to participate in the interviews only one did not

 133 take place after initially agreeing. A general impression was that the interviewees were all quite  
receptive to the topic of business models. One mana ger of a startup company mentioned:  "I’m 
already happy that somebody tries to define the term business model. It was one of the most  
violated terms. Everything was a business model. Everybody asked me what a business model is. I 
could never really define i t. It is good that somebody is looking at this ". 
Table 44 gives an overview of the interviews depicted in the following sections, showing the  
interviewee's economic domain, the number of employees, the company's use of concepts and  
tools, as well as the use of trial & error, and, the interviewee’s position concerning the questions.

7.2.1 Use of formal concepts and tools  
The first part of the interview aimed at  examining if the interviewees and their companies used  
models, formal models or even more sophisticated business tools in business planning. Of course  
this was not aimed at giving us such detailed insights to business concept use, as for example the 
study by Rigby  (2001) , but it can serve as an indicator for companies being comfortable with the  
use of concepts.  
Not surprisingly, very few companies, but all  the consultants used concepts or models. One  
consultant put it very clearly: “I have seen very few managers use concepts or models, but then  
that is one of the reasons why they bring in us consultants ”. The CEO of the industrial company  
Evaluation  
134 that actually used  some formal concepts said that “it took quite a lot of work to use these  
concepts, but it was very helpful. What was not satisfying was that we didn’t exploit them  
sufficiently once the work was done ”. At another point he mentioned that “at the end of the  day 
there stays  very little time for doing prospective business planning ”. Surprisingly, the smallest  
company interviewed used a conceptual tool for business planning. In the CEO’s opinion the  
most important aspect of using a concept was consistency. Conce pts would only bring advantages 
when rigorously applied.  
The younger companies had all made business plans during their startup phase. This could also be 
seen as the use of some sort of concept, as most of them had structured their business plan  
according  to recommendations in books available on the market. One executive compared the  
business model ontology to the business plan approach and saw it as a quite useful checklist,  
particularly for start -ups.  
A surprising finding was that a large number of comp anies relied deeply on trial and error to  
introduce new aspects to their business. The planning for this relied essentially on drafting text  
documents with a Word processor and calculating the financials with a spreadsheet program.  
7.2.2 Impression of the Busin ess Model Ontology and its Completeness  
One of the goals of the interviews was to capture the interviewees' impression of the business  
model ontology by presenting and explaining them different business model views (i.e.  
instantiations) as explained above.  This was principally destined at evaluating the business model  
ontology's fidelity with real word phenomena  (based on March and Smith 1995) . In other words,  
the objective was to find out if in the interviewees' opinion the ontology was suitable to describe 
the business model of a firm. The questions on the ontology's completeness, e.g. " In your opinion,  
what elements are missing in the model presented before ", served to start discussing fidelity to  
real world phenomena. Experience showed that the interviewees could give some important  
feedback on the ontology's composition, but had too little time and we re not in the position to  
evaluate completeness. Nevertheless, they were perfectly able to express themselves on the  
ontology's ability to represent the business logic of a firm or even their firm.  
All interviewees were quite happy with the presentation of  the presented instantiations of  
easyJet.com's business model and the more detailed views of ColorMailer, Nokia and Barnes &  
Noble. Two managers and two consultants insisted on the importance of the relationships  
between the elements. According to them it  helped to understand how the elements of a business  
model interact. The manager of a company active in services for financial companies stated that  
"people can start to see where some of the complexity is. It helps you visualize the relationships,  
you know , with clients and with suppliers ". One of the consultants saw the value of the ontology  
in representing the  relationships between the whole: "Everything that helps to  understand  the 
vision of the whole is great.  Also the relationships, the complexity, how  things relate play a very  
important role ". 
Furthermore three interviewees insisted that the ontology would become even more interesting if  
it were able to visualize cost relationships: "if you work with such a tool you should be able to  
have the whole cos t calculation if you click on infrastructure " or "if you have factors, how will  
some factors influence the final result, the whole? When you make projections it is funny how  
some factors have an influence on the end result ". One of the interviewed consulta nts 
acknowledged the difficulties of working with absolute numbers and suggested that "it would be 
interesting to calculate the impacts , for example with relative values ".  
A major concern of a manager of a startup company was that models create redundanci es: "the 
problem I think is redundancy. Matrixes bring redundancies. My fear is that if you click on these 
elements that you will find the same thing behind the elements ". 
The Business Model Ontology - a proposition in a design science approach  
 135 7.2.3 Business Model Use  
The fourth part of the interview was devoted to investigating pos sible uses of the presented  
ontology. This does not directly contribute to evaluating the ontology but investigates its  
usefulness. T he interviewees were asked seven questions with open answers:  
1. How could such a model help you define business indicators?  
2. How could such a model help you or a group of managers make better decisions?  
3. How could such a model improve some parts of strategic planning?  
4. How could such a model make it easier to chose and design appropriate information 
systems (e.g. software purchases  like Customer Relationship Management or Supply 
Chain Management...)  
5. How would it be able to foster innovation in a company with such a model?  
6. How do you think such a model could improve business process design and engineering?  
7. How could it be helpful to have such a model to communicate your business model. 
(when making decisions, to communicate with employees)  
The two most important themes that can be isolated from these seven questions were transparency 
and communication. They appeared in several answers  of the interviewees to several different  
questions. Transparency was particularly mentioned by two managers and two consultants. For  
example to the first question on business indicators one manager mentioned: "it is important to  
make things transparent to  show where cost and risks come from. Transparency is very  
important. […]. Such a framework can be interesting " (cf. quote q1 in Table 44). 
Communication was another recurring theme throughout the answers and explicitly addressed in 
the last question on communication. Especially in question two on decision making  
communication was mentioned by four interviewees in combination with transparency: "it’s also 
about transparency. Somebody puts up the sheet and says this is our company an d this is the way 
it works. Not everybody understands the same thing under the functioning of a company " (q33).  
One manager that was less enthusiastic about the business model concept's role in improving  
decision making acknowledged: " it helps in communica ting, in that sense it may improve decision 
making. But at least this way people talk about the same thing " (q12). One CEO of an industrial  
company said that the ontology "can be very helpful if not too complicated and adapted to  
specific managerial levels  for decision making: employee communication; customer  
presentations (screened); and training purposes (employees and customers) " (q26) and that  "it 
[the ontology] is a very useful instrument to initiate discussions with employees, partners or  
custom ers ab out process improvements.  The visualization helps also in the internal or external  
communication of business decisions " (q25) .  
Defining indicators . While quite a few interviewees seemed favorable to the idea that the use of 
the business model ontology cou ld improve defining business indicators they particularly stressed 
financial indicators. One interviewee pointed out the importance of transparency regarding costs  
and risks (q1). A consultant insisted on the financial relationships: " If I can change param eters in 
the model and see how this impacts costs, profits, then yes. If you can model cost structure and  
profitability you have to integrate it with the how and who [infra structure  and customer  
relationship ]. I have to understand how factors influence eac h other and the n I will look at  
evolutions more closely with my controllers " (q32).  
The chief operating officer (COO) of a company with 15 employees was rather critical and  
remarked that " in a company like ours everything is in the heads of the people ". He saw the value 
of the ontology elsewhere: "Where it can be very important is on the venture capital side or the  
investor side where you have to map business models quickly " (q11). Astonishingly, few  
Evaluation  
136 interviewees bought in on the idea of not only defining  financial indicators, but defining  
indicators throughout the business model pillars. One consultant that understood this asked in  
what the idea of deriving indicators from the ontology was different from the balance scorecard  
concept (q39).  
Improving decision making . The reactions to the question on improved decision making  
through tools based on the business model ontology where mixed. Many of the interviewed saw  
an indirect influence on decision making through discussing the fundamentals of a business (q3 4, 
q40, q18. q28) and through improving communication. The executive from the transport industry  
saw the force of schematizing in asking fundamental questions: "You will have to ask yourself in 
which box [element] I put what - it allows me to look at thing s from a new angle. It forces you to 
ask questions. But I see this rather as a tool for startups " (q28). One manager of a startup  
company talked about his experience at a large corporation where they used a simple conceptual  
model to communicate during mee tings. As regards the ontology he noticed that it may help  
people talk about the same thing and thus improve decision making (q12). Another COO was  
quite enthusiastic stating "it would certainly help to make better decisions. Oh yeah, I’d love to  
see this in my department " (q16). One of the interviewed consultants acknowledged the value of  
the ontology in communication but perceived it as too static to improve decision making (q44).  
The founder of a software company in the mobile industry felt that the prob lems he experienced  
in decision making where much more related to human aspects of the deciders (q6). The CEO of  
an industrial company was rather favorable, but questioned the availability of business data, "the 
framework can help to better set priorities,  however, to better support the decision process, the  
availability of business data needs to be ensured " (q22). Furthermore, he stressed the importance 
of having to be able to " introduce such a business model framework within reasonable means and 
resources ". 
Improving strategic planning . The ontology's possible direct or indirect contribution to  
improving strategic planning was perceived by all but two interviewees that answered the  
question. The CEO of the smallest company interviewed saw the business mode l concept as a  
way to outline the steps necessary to achieve a strategic goal (q2). Another manager saw the  
advantage in taking into account all the elements of a business model (q7). A consultant proposed 
combining business model and scenario approach in  order to have an impact on strategic  
planning: "[The business model concept] can indirectly influence direct strategic planning  
through scenarios and transparency " (q41).  
One executive that was reluctant stated: "We would think what kind of skills we need.  We would  
make a cost model and a revenue model. We would make a prototype and look if it works. If it  
doesn't work we would stop the test " (q13). This approach remarkably resembles some of the  
structures of the business model ontology. The executive from  the transport industry was also  
reluctant and thought that the ontology could have an impact on strategic planning if it allowed  
simulation (q29). Finally, the executive from the entertainment industry observed that looking at  
his enterprise through the bu siness model lens opened up new perspectives that were not usual to 
his business (q27).  
Helping in the design of  ISs. The question on improving the design of information systems (IS) 
was not answered by all the interviewed practitioners because not all of  them felt expert enough  
to reply. The answers that were given were quite mixed and split between three supporters and  
three opponents of the idea. Noteworthy, the supporters felt very strong about the necessity to  
describe the business logic of a company to improve IS design.  
The CEO of the industrial company, the COO of the financial platform and one of the  
management consultants strongly backed the link between business model and IS design. The  
first declared "once business models/processes are clearly  defined and evaluated, respective  
The Business Model Ontology - a proposition in a design science approach  
 137 appropriate information  systems can be easily defined.  There are significant differences in the  
business processes supported by off -the-shelf information systems.  Therefore, a business  
framework can not only help, but is almost required to identify the information system with the  
best fit " (q23). The second proponent mentioned:  "I think you make things much easier here…  
much, much easier. Well I think what we’ve done is that [..] it presents it  [the business model]  in 
a cle ar way. So everybody starts in the same place. Picking up on your point about taking it out  
of a man ager’s head and putting it on a piece of paper " (q17) . The consultant answered like the  
CEO: "You absolutely need a model before you can do anything " and  "especially if the  
dependencies and interactions of the different building blocks become clearer.  "Transparency is  
important for understanding what we do and how the building blocks interact " (q35).  
The CEO of the small Internet retailer felt that the busine ss model concept would probably not  
improve IS design because of its static nature  (q3). Similarly, the co -founder of the small  
software company remarked that the tools based on the ontology  "may influence IS design, but  
will not essentially help to improv e it" (q8). An executive from an Internet industry platform had  
the impression that according to his experiences “ engineers would not be favorable to use such a 
tool as the business model ontology ” (q19). Another manager saw the use of the ontology in IS  
design particularly for new economy companies of a networked type (q30).  
Increasing innovation . With regard to innovation there were two positions, the first accentuated  
the human capability aspect of innovation (q9, q14, q42) and the second drew attention  to the fact 
that the visualization and transparency created by the ontology could improve innovation (q4,  
q36, q31). A proponent of the first view stated:  "What is important is thinking it through. That is 
what takes time. If we look at the value proposit ion it is the thinking behind it that is important. If 
we are in front of investors the important thing is that it is innovative, that there’s a prototype,  
that it was tested and that it comes over technically. And that thinking takes time " (q14) . 
Similarl y, another one mentioned that "i nnovation is more about the people " (q9). A consultant  
commented that the ontology may help in innovating but that  "the tool will not generate  
innovation. You still need the creativity of the people " (q42).  
A proponent of th e positive effect on innovativeness pointed out that thinking through a business  
model will automatically stimulate innovation: "Establishing/elaborating business models and  
business processes requires thorough and in -depth analyses which leads by itself to innovative  
ideas and incentives on how to improve key indicators and elements of business models and how  
to better process steps or phases ", (q24). Similarly, another executive had the impression that  
structuring the thought process could be an advantage  for brainstorming and have an effect on  
innovation (q20).  
Improving process design . The interviewees that answered the question on improving process  
design were all relatively positive except for one that underlined the model’s static nature as he  
had al ready done for information systems (q5). They saw the ontology's value in its high level  
business logic description: "I think something like this model is the foundation. Before you can  
describe processes you have to have something like this at the generic  high level " (q37). The  
executive of a startup, however, emphasized that this is too sophisticated for small companies, " in 
a small company this would be overkill " (q15). The executive from the Internet industry platform  
had the impression that such a mode l would help people keep in mind the whole, because they  
would often forget other parts of the company when designing processes (q21).  
Improving communication . As explained above its ability to improve communication between  
different parties was seen as one of the strong points of the business model concept. One  
consultant saw it as " a formalism that everybody understands to speak the same language " (q43). 
Another one pointed out that it helped people to talk about the same thing:  "First you have to  
assure  that everybody is talking about the same thing. For example in customer relationships you 
Evaluation  
138 can imagine talking about hundred different things. It’s about presenting things in a simple way  
that is certainly the most important " (q38). One interviewee saw too ls based on the business  
model ontology as a means to communicate with employees, customers and for training purposes  
(q26). The interviewee opposed to the positive effect on communication felt that "it's too  
complicated to represent a business model in 9 elements. It's [a business model] more about how 
I make my money " (q10).  
Recapitulating, I think the interviews have shown a number of different things. The executives of  
very small companies have mixed opinions concerning the use of the business model on tology, 
particularly in applying it to their firm. Though not completely reluctant to the use of the  
ontology they feel that the business model of their company is already sufficiently clear.  
It also seems that the larger the companies of the interviewees  were the more favorable they  
tended to be regarding the use of the business model concept - with the exception of the executive 
from the transport industry. The consultants all seemed quite comfortable with the idea of  
applying the business model concept t o a number of different problem domains.  
The main strengths of the business model ontology that came out of the interviews were  
threefold:  
a) Its ability to create a transparent big picture of a business and to externalize the  
relationships and dependencies of the business elements.  
b) Its use is comparable to the use of a commonly understood language to enable  
communication.  
c) Its use can stimulate approaching and understanding the fundamental questions of a  
business.  
Of course the above mentioned strengths are  simply impressions of the interviewed business  
practitioners and would have to be empirically tested, but which would go beyond the possible of 
this dissertation. Therefore I formulate a set of three hypotheses that could be used in further  
business model  research. One of the problems of testing these hypotheses is that they demand  
specific tools (i.e. instantiations) based on the business model ontology. As mentioned by March  
and Smith (1995)  this means that the performance of tool or instantiation and ontology can not be 
dissociated. Nevertheless, the following hypotheses could give interesting hints on the use  of the  
business model concept:  
h1. A business model ontology based visualization tool can help business practitioners more  
quickly understand a business model and the relationships behind its elements.  
h2. A business model ontology based tool creates a common lang ue to address business  
model issues and in this regard improves communication between business practitioners.  
h3. Discussing business model issues with a business model ontology based tool (to  
understand business models) has an impact on discussion quality.  
7.3 BUSINESS MODEL CASE ST UDIES  
The business model ontology has been applied to three different case settings and is being used in 
a graduate thesis at the University of Bern. The first one was a case study that I have made of the 
Montreux Jazz Festival in Octob er 2003 and that I captured in  BM2L. The second setting was a  
case study and analysis of a small enterprise in form of a Masters thesis carried out by a student  
of the Masters Program in Business Information Systems (MBI) at the Business School of the  
Univ ersity of Lausanne  (Duri g-Kalashian 2003) . The third setting was the application of the  
ontology to the students' annual project of an IS strategy course of the MBI taught by Professor  
The Business Model Ontology - a proposition in a design science approach  
 139 Yves Pigneur. Finally, the ontology is being applied to a number of e -business cases in a grad uate 
thesis at the University of Bern.  
7.3.1 Instantiation, BM2L and Montreux Jazz Festival  
The case study of the Montreux Jazz Festival  illustrated in section  5 was  conducted in October  
2003. It included the description of the MJF's business  model  and its capture through the  
Business Model Modeling Language  BM2L (see section  6). In terms of validation this means  
three things. Firstly, by using the business model ontology to describe the business model of the  
Montreux Jazz Festival an instantiation of the ontology is created. Secondly , testing if the  
ontology is able to represent the business model of a real -world bus iness by discussing the  
captured MJF case study with its manager signifies getting insights on the  instantiation's  fidelity  
with real word phenomena and its understandability.  Thirdly , if it is possible to implement the  
ontology in a prototype and capture the MJF's business model it demonstrates feasibility, without, 
of course, expressing anything about its value for business. In their design science methodology  
March and Smith  (1995)  state that instantiations show that constructs, models or methods can be  
implemented in a working system. This demonstrate feasibility, enabling future concrete  
assessment of an artif act's suitability to its intended purpose.  
The discussion of the formally captured MJF case with the Mathieu Jaton, the number two and  
principle manager of the Festival, exposed two qualities of the business model ontology. One was 
its ability to  display  the big picture  and the other one was its ability to transparently display the  
different aspects of a business model. He said that "often people don't perceive the Montreux Jazz 
Festival as a business because they associate it to music and party rather tha n to hard work,  
management and budgets. The business model concept exposes the business aspects of the  
festival". Mr. Jaton saw the structured business model as a way to analyze the Festival and to  
communicate some aspects to certain stakeholders. He was interested in further analysis and  
feedback on the case study.  
A very interesting application which is further investigated in section  8.1 and is currently quite  
important to the MJF is the alignment between its business model and future information systems. 
The MJF is in the phase of evaluating new possibilities to manage its JAZZ currency and  
eventually new access systems for concert visitors and staff members.  
7.3.2 Use and test ontology by others - feedback  
My chocolate . The most in -depth use of the business model ontology outside this research was its 
application to an artisan chocolate producer. The small enterprise based in Lausanne,  
Switzerland, wanted to complement its physical business with an online shop. The analysis  
resulted in a Masters Thesis  (Durig -Kalashian 2003) . Though very small in scale the study gives  
some very nice insights on the applicability of the concept.  Its use for validation of the ont ology 
stays  somewhat  limited yet it gives a good  indication on usability.  
The firm used the ontology to get a better understanding of the business logic of the company in  
order to go online. Furthermore, the application of the business model concept aimed  at 
facilitating the alignment between IT infrastructure and the business  (based on the concepts of  
Weill and Vitale 2002) . The ontology was also used to define the required application portfolio  
(based on the matrix by Ward 1988)  and to identify indicators to measure business performance  
(based on the BSC by Kaplan an d Norton 1992) .  
According to the author of the analysis developing a formal business model for the chocolate  
producer helped the firm to clearly define and understand its business logic. It made clear the  
links between the firm's value proposition, the customer relationships through which this value  
proposition would best be communicated, and the capabilities and resources necessary to deliver  
Evaluation  
140 them. Above all, the business model seemed to serve to define the IT infrastructure enabling the  
implementation of the business logic. For each part of the business model, the supporting IT  
infrastructure services were defined, and the corresponding application portfolio developed and  
analyzed in terms of its life cycle management. Finally, the business model analysi s included the  
development of a set of BSC indicators to measure the performance of the business.  
Masters students’ case studies . The business model concepts  that underpin the business model  
ontology were taught during the first half of an IS strategy cour se of the Masters in Business  
Information Systems by Professor Yves Pigneur at the business school of the University of  
Lausanne. The second part of the course was on business -IT alignment, industry analysis,  
disruptive technologies and prospecting methods  (e.g. scenarios). Within the scope of this course 
the students had to analyze a business model by using the elements of the business model  
ontology. Furthermore, they studied alignment, application portfolio, industry actors and  
prospects of the companies  in question. The students could freely choose the cases they wanted to 
analyze (cf. see  Table 45). This annual course project was document in form of a pre -formatted 
word document.  Company & industry sector  Company information

Table 45: Masters students’ case studies  
The part of interest for this dissertation was on the business model analysis of the cases studies  
and the use of the concepts taught in the course. Therefore I asked the students to fill out a  
questionnaire assessing the usefulness of the ont ology and the concepts applied to their particular 
case study. The closed questions that the students were asked to rate between 1 and 5 (1 = very  
definitely not, 3 = to some extent, 5 = very definitely) are shown in  Table 46. In addition some  
open ended question investigated the students’ experience using the business model concept. A  
total of 9 questionnaires were filled out.  Closed interview questions  rated between 1 and 5 (1 = very definitely not, 3 = to some extent, 5 = very d efinitely)  average  
Did the concepts exposed in the course "Stratégies et  technologies de l'information" allow you to accurately describe 
the business model of the company you analyzed ? 3.89 
How closely do the elements of the sample document cover the asp ects of the business model analyzed?  4 
Was the concept "proposition de valeur" relevant to describe the business model you analyzed?  4.44 
Was the concept "clients et canaux de distributions"  relevant to describe the business model you analyzed?  3.78 
Was the concept "relation -client et confiance" relevant to describe the business model you analyzed?  3.78 
Was the concept "activités et compétence" relevant to describe the business model you analyzed?  3.89 
Was the concept "partenariat" relevant to describe  the business model you analyzed?  4.11 
In your opinion is the business model concept useful?  4.33 
Table 46: Interview questions Masters Students  
The Business Model Ontology - a proposition in a design science approach  
 141 The students seemed quite happy with the concepts chosen to describe the business mod el 
elements as there was no score under 3 and the average score of the first question was close to 4  
(= definitely). Also, the structure of the sample document modelled after the ontology seemed to  
satisfyingly cover the aspects of the students’ business model case studies scoring an average of  
4. From the specific concepts the value proposition was the most appreciated, while all of them  
seemed sufficiently relevant to describe the business model element in question. The question on  
the overall usefulness of the business model concept scored a very high average of 4.33.  
In the open questions one student remarked that the business model concept helped him  
thoroughly reflect on his own company that is in the early stages of its development. Another  
student found it difficult to apply the business model concepts. Similarly, another student  
mentioned that the description of a business model demanded a large time investment from the  
interviewers and the interviewees. Finally, one student said the business model  analysis was very  
welcomed and appreciated by the company they studied, because it was a way to describe their  
company which they didn’t know before.  
7.3.3 Use of the ontology in other contexts  
The business model ontology was also used in a developing economy c ontext. Some propositions 
were made to apply the ontology for business model knowledge transfer to developing countries  
(Osterwalder 2002; Osterwalder, Rossi et al. 2002; Osterwalder 2004) . Furthermore, in the same  
context the 9 business mod el elements were used to describe the business model of a Bangladeshi  
Telecommunication Company, Grameen Phone, which aims at connecting Bangladesh’s rural  
villages (Osterwalder 2004) .  
7.4 TESTING ONTOLOGIES – WHAT’S NEXT  
More in depth validation of the ontology and its components with different approaches are  
imaginable. It could be interesting to give the same cas e study information to different people and 
ask them to use the business model ontology to capture the case' business model. Similar  
outcomes would give more information on the ontology's domain authority. Such an experiment,  
however, would not provide any  input on the ontology's usefulness in a business setting. To learn 
more on the ontology's business value one would have to test concrete tools (i.e. artifacts) built on 
the basis of the ontology. This would allow the assessment of a tools' suitability to  an intended  
purpose and would indirectly validate the ontology.  
For example, a visualization tool and its ability to improve communication could be tested in a  
management workshop. Equally, the concepts exposed in section  8.1 on alignment could be used  
and assessed in a workshop setting and their impact tested. This would satisfy March and Smith's 
(1995)  second stage of design science applying the social science couple of theorizing and  
justifying. Additionally, one could imagine testing two or more similar business model concepts  
and comparing the outcome.  
Concretely, I propose  that future work on business models includes testing the following  
hypotheses developed on the basis of the interviews with business practitioners (see section 7.2):  
h1. A business model ontology based visualization tool can help business practitioners more  
quickly understand a business model and the relationships behind its elements.  
h2. A business model ontology based tool creates a common langue to address business  
model issues and in this regard improves communication between business practitioners.  
h3. Discussing business model issues with a business model ontology based tool (to  
understand business models) has an impact on discussion quality.  
Evaluation  
142 However, testing these hypothesis is not an easy task and constitutes an entire research in itself.  
While h1 seems more or less straight forward to test h2 and h3 would require observing a  
management team over a period of time before introducing the business model ontology. In a first 
ethnographic -like step one would have to try to assess communication style and discussion  
quality and in a second step one could apply the business model ontology and analyze the change.  
Another validation method worth investigating is the comparison  of the business model ontology  
with other models. It could be interesting to assess the same case using different approaches and  
define useful metrics to compare the outcome.  As Gordijn's E3value framework  uses a similar  
ontological approach to the one ap plied in this research it could be  appealing  to compare  it with  
the business model ontology.  
Noteworthy is the fact that of all the authors that presented different business model frameworks  
only Gordijn  (2003)  has written about some kind of evaluation having applied the  e3-value  
methodology in consultancy work. None of the authors has set up any hypothesis and tested them 
in a field setting.  
Note:  
The concept of bu siness models and the business model ontology have been presented at several peer -reviewed 
conferences (Ben Lagha, Osterwalder et al. 2001; O sterwalder, Ben Lagha et al. 2002; Osterwalder and Pigneur 2002) , 
doctoral workshops  (Osterwalder 2002; Osterwalder and Pigneur 2002) , published at a number of occasions  
(Dubosson, Osterwalder et al. 2002) . The most recent version of the ontology will appear as a book chapter in a book  
on "Value Creation from E-Business Models " (Currie 2003) . Some of the constructs have also been presented as  
separate papers at peer -reviewed IS conferences  (Osterwalder and Pigneur 2003; Osterwalder and Pigneur 2003) . One  
paper presented the business model ontology as a means to achieve an alignment between business strategy and  
information systems (Osterwalder and Pigneur 2003) .  
More interestingly, the business model ontology has been recognized  by the business model research community  
(Pateli 2002; Pateli and Giaglis 2003)  and has led to an international workshop on business models  (Osterwalder and  
Pigneur 2002)  and to a panel on business models at the 16th Bled Electronic Commerce Conference. This has created an 
interesting dynamic of exchange between researchers in the business model domain, such as with Jaap Gordijn, Harry  
Bouwman, Patrick Stähler, Otto Petrovic and Christian Kittl.  
 
The Business Model Ontology - a proposition in a design science approach  
 143 8 ONTOLOGY APPLIC ATION S AND FUTURE RESEARCH  
In this section of the dissertation I outline some ideas for applications and possible future research 
that draw from and build on the research described in this thesis. As business models are a very  
broad domain and still a young research  stream this list of applications is of course non -
exhaustive. It contains some research directions that I think are worth pursuing and that form an  
extension to the business model ontology presented in the foregoing sections.  
8.1 ALIGNMENT  
The first area of further research that could be promising is alignment between strategy,  
organization and IT. From an alignment standpoint, if the business model has been precisely  
defined using the business model ontology it should help to improve answering the following  
questions visualized in Figure 68. 
Strategy. What are the indicators of the executive information system for monitoring the strategy, 
using for example a balanced scorecard approach  (Kaplan and Norton 1992)  with its financial,  
customer, internal business, and innovation and learning perspectives?  
Organization. What is the alignment profile with its IS role (opportunistic, comprehensive or  
efficient), IS sourcing arrangement (in -sourcing, selective or outsourcing) and IS structure  
(decentralized, shared or centralized), using for example the “defender, prospector, analyser”  
framework adopted by (Hirschheim and Sabherwal 2001) ? 
Technology. What is the application portfolio with its turnaround, strategic, factory and support  
applications (Ward 1988) ? What is the IT infrastructure (Weill and Vitale 2002)  with its different 
components?

144 Sabherwal 2001) . Yet, it seems that all publications are rather vague in terms of how to practice  
alignment, apart from some rules of thumb  (Luftman 1996) . For the time being the most  
refer enced method is still the relatively general framework by Venkatraman and Henderson  
(Henderson and Venkatraman 1993) . Thus, in the following sections I try to develop one of the  
enablers of alignment and tackle one of the inhibitors, which are "IT understands business"  
respectively "IT does not understand business", both mentioned in a field study by Luftman  
(1993) .  
Concretely, I argue that the business model concept ca n serve as a federator between "the worlds  
of business and IT". In other words, business people have to be able to clearly formulate their  
vision and what they expect from IS people and IS staff has to be able to point out how  
Information and Communication  Technology (ICT) can improve a company's business goals.  
Yet, these two worlds, the one of business and the one of technology, sometimes seem quite  
distant. On the one hand every manager and entrepreneur has an intuitive understanding of how  
his business  works, but in many cases she or he is rarely able to communicate it in a clear and  
simple way  (Linder and Cantrell 2000) . On the other hand, IS people have a clear idea of what  
information technologies are able to accomplish in IS management, but they struggle to achieve a 
strategic fit with the big (business) picture  (Camponovo, Osterwalder et al. 2003) . Therefore,  
Chesbrough and Rosenbloom  (2000)  perceive the business model as a mediating construct  
between technology and economic value.  
8.1.1 Information Technology Alignment  
Weill and Vitale  (2002, p.18)  "define  a firm’s information technology portfolio as its total  
investment in computing and communications technology. The IT portfolio thus includes  
hardware, software, telecommunications, electronically stored data, devices to collect and  
represent that data, and the people who provide IT services. The IT portfolio includes both the  
“insourced” IT capabilities provided by internal groups and the IT capabilities outsourced to  
external suppliers ". They decompose the IT portfolio into three layers, from which  the first two  
represent the firm's IT infrastructure (see Figure 69). The first basic layer includes IT components, 
human IT infrastructure and shared IT services. The second layer contains shared and standard IT 
applications, whi ch change less regularly such as accounting, budgeting or human resource  
management. The top layer consists of fast changing local applications.

The Business Model Ontology - a proposition in a design science approach  
 145 In terms of IT alignment with business I propose two things. Firstly, to cross the nine basic  
building blocks describing a company's business model with Weill and Vitale's (2002)  first layer  
of IT infrastruct ure services, which they divided into nine service areas (see Table 47). Using this 
matrix as a basis for analysis it may be able to achieve a better alignment between the business  
logic of a company and the IT services provided by  the IS department.  
Secondly, I propose using the nine  basic building blocks of a company's business model to  
analyze its need in terms of IT applications (the top two layers of the IT portfolio). In addition,  
these application's strategic importance shou ld be assessed with Ward's application portfolio  
theory (Ward 1988) . I believe this could allow a company to streamline its application portfolio  
and achieve a better fit with its business logic.  
IT Infrastructure Services Alignment . As explained above, one proposition is to  improve 
business and IT infrastructure service alignment by crossing the business model concept with the  
IT service areas defined by Weill and Vitale  (2002) . These contain nine areas, namely  
Application Infrastructure, Communications, Ma nagement, Data Management, IT Management,  
Security, Architecture and Standards, Channel Management, IT Research and Development and  
Training and Education in IT.  
Application Infrastructure  includes purchasing software, developing proprietary  applications, 
modifying applications, providing  installation and technical support, and other tasks  related to  
ensuring that applications are meeting the  needs of the organization.   
Communications Management  focuses on  all the technolog ies and infrastructures  that facil itate 
digital communication both within  the organization and with the outside world.  
Data Management  refers to the way the organization  structures and handles its information  
resources. Data  may be sourced from internal or external databases.   
IT manageme nt includes many  of the professional and strategic activities of the information  
technology group including negotiation, IS  planning, project management, and other tasks.  
Security  refers to the need to protect data, equipment,  and processing time.  
IT arch itecture  is a set of policies  and rules that govern the use of IT and plot a migration path to 
the way business  will be done in the future.  
Channel management  recognizes that new and emerging  technologies allow direct connections or 
distribution  channels t o customers.  
IT research and development  includes identifying and  testing new technologies for business  
purposes and  evaluating proposals for new information systems initiatives.  
IT training  and education  ensures computer proficiency levels  meeting corpora te requirements.  
IS management  education is the  education aimed at senior levels  in the firm designed to generate  
value from IT use.

Table 47: IT Infrastructure Service Alignment  
Table 47 illustrates the matrix combining business model and IT infrastructure services to analy ze 
a company's need in IT services. Once the business model is captured and described with all its  
elements it could serve as a basis to study what needs in terms of IT services are required to  
optimize business. I hypothesize that it is faster (and easier ) to start from a captured, depicted and 
explained business model to design and adapt IT services than to start from the discussion and  
meetings usually dominating alignment today. Of course this assumption would have to be tested  
in the field.  
Applicatio n Portfolio Alignment . The second proposition I make is the alignment between  
business and a company's portfolio of applications (cf. the second and third layer in  Figure 69). 
Therefore, in a first step a company has to analyze wha t applications underpin its business model  
and in a second step it has to assess their contribution to business, their performance and their  
strategic importance. The first step can be improved by departing from the captured and described 
business model. The second step can be achieved by applying portfolio management theories  
coming from finance to IT/IS applications, as more and more companies are starting to do  
(Hoffman 2003; Nairn 2003) . In this proposition I apply Ward's Application Portfolio Framework 
(Ward 1988) . Ward classifies a company's applications on two axes, their potential to contribute  
to future business and the company's dependency of an application (cf.  Figure 70). He  
distinguishes between four categories of applications. Strategic applications that provide  
comparative advantage and are critical to future business success. Key Operational applications,  
which sus tain the existing business operations. Support applications that improve business  
efficiency. High Potential applications, which are innovative applications and may create  
substantial revenue in the future but which are not yet proven.

Table 48: Business Model and Application Portfolio  
Similar to the precedent proposition on IT infrastructure service alignment it makes sense to  
combine the captured business model elements with the application portfolio approach in a matrix 
(see cf. Table 48). This would show how applications are spread over the business model and  
indicate their importance.  
 
Figure 70: Application Portfolio  
8.1.2 Organizational Alignment  
Alignment between strategy and business organization is another field where the business model  
ontology might be able to contribute. This is, however, less clear than the previous proposition on 
alignment between strategy and technology.  
One area of contribution cou ld be the improvement of business process design due to a better  
understanding of the business model. One could imagine that the granularity of the business  
model ontology could be increased, particularly in the infrastructure pillar, in order to gradually  
approach the process level (see  Figure 71). By increasing the granularity of description of the

148 VALUE CONFIGURATION, the PARTNERSHIPS and the CAPABILITIES it would become  
possible to close the gap that still exists between busines s strategy and business processes.  
 
Figure 71: From Strategy to Processes  
Another interesting field of organizational alignment could be looking into a company's IS  
structure and its relationship to busi ness strategy. Based on Hirschheim and Sabherwal's  (2001)  
alignment approach it might be appealing to introduce the business model ontology to concretize  
their alignment framework (outlined in  Table 49). They differentiate between three business  
strategies, which are the Defenders, the Prospectors and the Analyzers. Then they cross these  
strategies with the IS role (opportunistic, comprehensive, defender), the IS sourcing arrangements 
(insourcing , selective sourcing, outsourcing) and the IS structure (decentralized, shared,  
centralized). Further research would aim at including the business model ontology to approach  
business strategy and IS role, sourcing arrangement and structure. The business mo del concept  
could be used to define the business strategy of either prospector, analyzer or defender.  Alignment Profile  Infusion:

8.1.3 Strategy Alignment  
Having captured, understood and described a business model should make it easier to define the  
indicators to follow in the executive information system in o rder to monitor the business strategy. 
Table 50 shows that indicators could be chosen in every business model element, followed in an  
IS displaying the current state, showing how it performs compared to a target value and raising a n 
alarm when falling under a predefined critical value. As in the balance scorecard approach  
(Kaplan and Norton 1992)  this method starts from a set of defined areas . The advantage is that  
having captured the business logic of the firm it should become easier to identify specific  
indicators than starting from a blank sheet of paper.

8.1.4 Montreux Jazz Festival  
In this section I apply some of  the ideas presented above to the Montreux Jazz Festival (MJF).  
The example shall illustrate the presented concepts of alignment and stimulate reflection rather  
than serve as a fully elaborated case. The information used come from a number of interviews  
and personal work experience at the Montreux Jazz Festival.  
8.1.5 MJF Information Technology Alignment  
IT infrastructure service alignment . Firstly, I look into IT infrastructure service alignment by  
outlining all the business model elements of the  MJF (cf. sectio n 5) and  reflecting on the IT  
services that should exist to support them (see  Table 51 and Table 52). This gives us a basic idea 
of what IT services should exist  to underpin the MJF's specific business model.  
For example, the MJF has six value propositions of which some considerably use IT service  
infrastructures and others little or not at all. The first value proposition, the MJF's main concerts,  
essentially use  two IT service areas which are  communications management  and distribution  
channel management  (cf. 1st line in  Table 51). The former is required because the concert staff  
and production staff (e.g. cameramen) communicate intensely  in order to guarantee a sound  
event. However, this is a basic IT service that is not key to the value proposition. The latter in  
contrast is a key service because the majority of tickets are sold through electronic channels.  
A business model element that  relies heavily on IT infrastructure services and that I describe in  
detail is the management of the so -called Festival -own JAZZ currency and the payments with  
CASH -cards (cf. 12th line in  Table 52). In fact, in the 2003 edition usi ng an own currency  
required 6 from the nine IT infrastructure services and in the future it may well require them all.  
As explained earlier in the MJF business model (cf. section  5.1.4 ) the Festival operates its own  
currency pr imarily to monitor revenue streams and transaction cuts (i.e. commissions) from the  
food and commerce stands but also for security reasons. All purchases made at the MJF are made 
either with JAZZ or electronically with so -called CASH -cards. CASH is an elec tronic means of  
payment for small amounts  created by Swiss banks and Post Finance and operated by Telekurs -
Multipay . It is found in the form of a chip on the Maestro card (a debit card), the Postcard CASH 
card and on neutral CASH card (as sold at the MJF) . It can be loaded with money  at any ATM or 
postal banking machine in Switzerland.  Normally it functions as illustrated in  Figure 72. A shop  
has a CASH enabled card terminal that is connected to Telekurs -Multipay over the telephone line. 
Telekurs does the clearing of any CASH purchase and the amount is credited to the shop's bank  
Ontology Applications and Future R esearch  
150 account.  
 
Figure 72: CASH transactions  
Because the MJF takes a transaction cut of the independent merc hant's revenue the functioning of 
the CASH system at the Festival is quite different. The terminals in the shops and in the bars are  
not directly connected to a telephone line but are physically synchronized with a docking station  
every end of the day at the MJF operations office. The transactions stored on the terminals are  
seized by the docking station and are communicated over an ISDN -line to a sort of bookkeeping -
application and hosted by Ergonomics, the company that operates the CASH system at the MJF.  
Ergonomics forwards the transactions to Telekurs for clearing and also feeds them to a web  
application used by the MJF operations. Telekurs directly credits the transactions to a number of  
MJF bank accounts (cf. Figure 73).  
At th e same time the merchants bring the JAZZ they have earned during a Festival day to the  
MJF operations office where they are accounted for and booked to the Ergonomics bookkeeping  
application. Now the MJF exactly knows how much an independent merchant has e arned and can 
pay him the amount owed, which is the turnover minus the transaction cut. The views on the  
turnovers generated from the bookkeeping application  for management purposes are generated in 
a stand -alone MS Excel application, which is not integrat ed.  
Hence, in terms of IT services this requires an  Application Infrastructure , Communication s 
Management , Data Management and Security  for bookkeeping and monitoring JAZZ and CASH  
turnovers as well as for generating management views on transaction data.  Furthermore, it  
requires services in  IT Management  and  Architecture and Standards  because Ergonomics, a  
partner, is managing the CASH -system and the bookkeeping application.

The Business Model Ontology - a proposition in a design science approach  
 151 In 2000 the MJF signed a contract with Ergonomics to conceive a paycenter for managing the  
JAZZ currency and CASH payments.  Ergonomics entered the contract because it needed a  
testbed for a much larger contract with the Swiss Exposition in 2002, Expo.02. So the  
collaboration functioned very well until 2002. Now, however, Ergonomics has little interest in  
updating and adapting the MJF paycenter to current needs because the Festival is too small of a  
client. Therefore the MJF is looking for other solutions to its problems. One rather unsatisfying  
possibility would be to return to a merely coin -based JAZZ currency as used before 20 00. 
Another possibility is being explored with one of the main sponsors, NAGRA of the Kudelski  
Group. This possibility could be followed because Mr. Kudelski is on the board of the MJF  
foundation.  
Since NAGRA is a provider of smart card solutions and phys ical access and ticketing solutions a  
collaboration with the MJF would open up a wide range of imaginable systems. One solution  
would consist in replacing the JAZZ and CASH either by conventional smartcards and terminals  
or by contact less smartc ards and transponders . This would allow the MJF to expand the use of the 
smartcards to other uses than payment. The cards could be used as tickets for concert visitors, as  
access identifiers to restricted areas for staff and for a variety of user. In addition, as NAG RA 
owns Ticket Corner, the whole system from the ticket purchase to the MJF visit could be  
integrated.  
In terms of IT service alignment this allows exploring which other elements of the business  
model such a system would affect and in which element it wou ld open up new opportunities (see 
Table 51 and Table 52). In an in -depth alignment study the different cells of the matrix would of  
course be described in detail.

154 Application Portfolio . Besides aligning the first level of Weill and Vitale's IT portfolio (cf.  
Figure 69), the IT infrastructure services, it is also interesting to align the second and third level, a 
company's stable and volatile applications. Consequently, I applied the application portfolio  
concepts described in section  8.1.1  to the MJF.  Table 53 shows an excerpt of the MJF's  
application portfolio illustrating those applications underpinning its activities in the Festival's  
value configuration. They have been classified among  strategic , key oper ational , support  and 
high potential  applications  (Ward 1988) . Their return on investment (ROI), however, has not  
been assessed, as some application portfolio theories propose (Nairn 2003) .  Activit ies Strategic  Key Operational  Support  High Potential

The excerpt of the MJF's application portfolio shows that the Festival's Website is currently its  
only strategic application, being characterized by a high degree of dependency and a large  
potenti al to achieve future business goals. As illustrated in the case study the MJF sells close to  
50 percent of its tickets over its Website, impressive, but still leaving place for improvement and  
for progress in promotional activities.  
A possible strategic application that is still in the brainstorming phase is a new smartcard  
payment and access application by NAGRA replacing its JAZZ currency and CASH payments  
managed in its Paycenter conceived by Ergonomics. The Paycenter is a  key operational  
application ch aracterized by a high degree of dependency, but little potential for future business.  
Contrary to NAGRA's solution which could be extended from a payment system to a fully -
fledged access system, the paycenter is limited to pay management (JAZZ & CASH).  
Another particularity of the MJF's application portfolio is that the accounting programme is  
merely a support application that is neither integrated with the Paycenter, the Volunteer Database, 
nor contract management with Merchants or Volunteers. This may be  explainable by the  
Festival's event character (the main MJF lasts three weeks), but causes endless hassles, mistakes  
and corrections. It would make sense to introduce a light Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)  
software, integrating the business model elem ents, such as payment, staff and contract  
management, thus shifting to a key operational application .  
The Business Model Ontology - a proposition in a design science approach  
 155 8.1.6 MJF Organizational Alignment  
In this section I very briefly illustrate a part of the MJF's organizational IT/IS alignment based on 
the concepts of Hirsch heim and Sabherwal (2001)  explained in section 8.1.1 .  
Currently, based on the understanding of the MJF's business model, in terms of business strategy  
the Festival is mainly a  defender . Aft er many years of growth it has now reached its capacity  
limits concerning the main event, the annual Festival in Montreux, on which the majority of its  
value proposition s are based. The MJF now lasts three weeks, compared to a few days initially,  
attracts  240'000 visitors, which the venue can just manage to absorb and sells close to 100 percent 
of concert seats. Thus, it has shifted from "acquiring" new visitors in the last years to "retaining"  
its existing visitors, as the customer relationship shows. Acc ordingly in terms of IT/IS alignment  
it should have a  utility profile  focusing on low -cost delivery. This would mean that the IS role  
should be efficient, the IS sourcing based on outsourcing and the IS structure should be  
centralized. Yet, as the previous  section on IT alignment has shown, the MJF's IT and IS are not  
based on efficiency but seem rather opportunistic. Similarly, the IS structure is not as centralized 
as a utility profile  would ask, but is spread over the different activities, such as volunt eer 
management and paycenter (cf. grey fields in Table 54).  
So if the MJF plans to maintain its current  defender  business model it should adopt a clear utility  
profile. This would mean shifting the  IS role  to efficient  and central ize its IS structure . But as a  
business model analysis has shown, the MJF might shift towards a different business strategy and 
modify its current business model. One element of possible change would be the intensification  
of its franchising activities. Un til now, this has only modestly contributed to the MJF's turnover,  
but this could rapidly change. For the existing business model this would probably not mean a  
substantial change, except for a new emphasis of the franchise value proposition. A business  
model change with much larger consequences would be the introduction of selling downloads  
form its huge collection of recordings or selling live concert streaming over the Internet  to 
individual customers. This would mean the introduction of a completely new  value proposition  
targeting new segments of customers with a strong impact on the value configuration and  
partnering. As the MJF does obviously not possess the capabilities to offer music downloading  
partnerships with companies offering such services woul d be imaginable.  
Such a business model would be based on an  analyzer  business strategy as it combines  defender  
(annual Festival) and  prospector  (online music sales). As regards alignment this would mean  
shifting from a  utility profile  to an  alliance profil e based on partnering (see  Table 54). Clearly,  
this would mean that IT/IS would take a more active role. The IS's orientation would be toward  
comprehensiveness , using a  selective sourcing  strategy, permitting flexibility and third -party 
assistance to help build alliances, while the structure would be shared .  Alignment Profile  Infusion:

8.2 BUSINESS MODEL COMPA RISON  
Another interesting research direction could be a general characterization and classification of  
business mode ls in order to compare them. Porter  (2001)  essentially classified businesses among  
cost leaders and differentiators, Timmers  (1998)  classifies business models among degree of  
innovation and degree  of integration and Tapscott, Ticoll et al.  (2000)  classify b-webs among  
economic control and value integration. I believe that nowadays where business models are  
increasingly complex and different variables influence its success it could be interesting to apply  
a more fine -grained characterization or classification. Therefore, I propose assessing business  
models on nine axes which are the nine basic building blocks of a business model. Every one of  
these axis would allow characterizing a specific part of  a company's business model (see  Figure 
74).  
Value Proposition/Product/Value Leadership. To characterize the value proposition of a company  
one could imagine a scale showing how strong it performs concerning the price/value ratio of its 
value proposition(s).  
Target Customer/Market Share. A second scale could show the company's market share to show  
its actual dominance in a specific market.  
Distribution Channel/Channel Complexity. Channels could be characterized by there complexity  
having companies with a single distribution channel at the low end of the scale, companies with  
several stand -alone channels in the middle and companies with a range of complex and  
The Business Model Ontology - a proposition in a design science approach  
 157 interrelated channels at the high end.  
Relationships/Customer Integration . The relationship scale could show how integrated a  
company's customers are. In other words, how deeply they are involved in the value creation  
process and how far the value proposition is tailored to their specific needs.  
Value Configuration/Degree of Business Model Integration. The value configuration could be  
characterized by the degree of integration of the business model. The computer manufacturer  
Dell, for example, has a very integrated business model where everything from the supply chain  
to custom er service is highly integrated.  
Capabilities/Spread. The capabilities of a company could be characterized by the range or spread  
of the different capabilities necessary to execute the business model. A business model that builds 
on few and similar capabi lities would be found at the low end of the scale, whereas a business  
models that demand many and diverse capabilities would be found at the other end.  
Partnerships/Networkedness. This element could be characterized by the degree of networkedness 
of a comp any. In other words with how many partners the company works to execute its business 
model.  
Cost Structure/Low -Cost Leadership. Characterizing the cost structure is rather straight forward.  
At the top end of the scale we have the low cost leaders.  
Revenue  Model/Revenue Diversity. The revenue model could be characterized by the diversity of 
its revenue streams. A company with a single revenue stream would be found at the low end of  
the scale and a company with diverse revenue streams at the other end.

Figure 75 illustrates  how a business model assessment would look like and shows  a comparison  
of two business models in the airline industry , the one of the no -frills carrier easyJet compared to 
a conventional flag carrier. One could even imagine to go one step further and assess a larger  
number of business models in or across industries and try to analyze if there are any specific  
patterns in  the characteristics of successful business models.  Value Proposition

The Business Model Ontology - a proposition in a design science approach  
 159 9 CONCLUSION  
The interviews with business practitioners have shown that the business mod el concept and  
related computer -based tools have potential to be further explored. Above all, the ability  to create 
a transparent big picture of a business and to externalize the relationships and dependencies of  
business elements seem to interest executiv es and consultants. Furthermore, business models  
were perceived as a tool to create a commonly understood language to improve communication  
and understanding of the fundamental questions of a business.  
In this dissertation I argue that a more  rigid  concep tual approach to business models is necessary  
in order to seize the possibilities detected with business practitioners. Particularly, if one  
envisages to build computer -based business model tools a rigorous model describing the concepts 
of a business model  is indispensable. Based on this need the main contribution of this thesis is the 
business model ontology. Building on existing knowledge of the domain the ontology describes  
the terms, elements, attributes and relationships of the business model concept.  In regard to  
comparable concepts the business model ontology represents a synthesis of the overall literature  
and a step forward in the rigor of conceptualization.  
Regarding evaluation the ontology has been applied to a case study and its fidelity with re al world 
phenomena (interviews) based on March and Smith's  (1995)  design science methodology  has 
been investig ated. Further research  on evaluation and validation of the business model ontology  
was described by proposing different approaches. Also, further research  on istantiations based on  
theorizing and justifying would tackle issues related to business model ont ology -based tools and  
their performance.  
As explained  throughout the dissertation  the rigorous ontological approach makes it possible to  
implement the business model concept into a computer -based tool. This has been demonstrated  
by realizing the Business Model Modelling Language BM2L, an XML -based description  
language. This prototype has allowed capturing  and describing  the case study of the Montreux  
Jazz Festival, which would have been cumbersome without. Further potential lies in the extension 
into an ana lytical tool, for example, for designing, simulating and comparing business models.  
In the section on future research I have outlined a number of possible paths for further exploring  
the potential of the business model ontology in alignment of business an d IT/IS strategy.  
Moreover, it could be interesting to capture a large number of business models with the ontology  
to analyze if there are any patterns characterizing successful business models .
