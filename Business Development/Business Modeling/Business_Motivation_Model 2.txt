The Business Motivation Model Business Governance in a Volatile World  
   Copyright, 2010.  The Business Rules Group vi Rel. 1.4  Preface to Release 1.4 In 2010, the OMG’s (Object Management Group’s) Revision Task Force (RTF) completed its work on Version 1.1 of the Business Motivation Model and published its updated specification.1  This Release 1.4 of the Business Rules Group’s (BRG’s) publication applies the relevant changes from OMG BMM Version 1.1, including updates for consistency with sibling standards (SBVR, BPDM, and OSM).  The “differences” notes below, for BRG’s Release 1.3, still apply. Preface to Release 1.3 In 2005, the Business Motivation Model became an adopted standard of the OMG (Object Management Group).  The OMG’s Finalization Task Force (FTF) completed its work in Sept. 2007.2  Release 1.3 reflects the few changes to the business-facing view of the Model from that standardization work.  These include:  the addition of a ‘uses’ fact type between Assessments, the addition of ‘Influencing Organization’ and its relationship to ‘Influencer’, the addition of a family of concepts for Asset and Liability, and a changed wording used for decomposition fact types (from ‘component of/part of’ to ‘includes/included in’). Release 1.3 also has some differences of omission from the OMG work.  These include: • The Concepts Catalog of the OMG work is represented as an SBVR business vocabulary expressed in SBVR Structured English.  That language was the basis for producing a UML/MOF model of BMM.  This normative model is one on which tools can be based — indeed, as of this writing at least five BMM support tools with interchange capabilities are being built on that basis. • In Release 1.3 the categories shown for Influencer and Assessment continue to be presented as “recommended”; the OMG specification makes this distinction by defining these categories as a “recommended default” — i.e., not part of the normative model.  Furthermore, to support the implementation of these (and alternative) schemes, the OMG BMM specifies general categorization concepts so that BMM users can implement their own categories of Influencer, Assessment, and Influencing Organization. A reader interested in the detail of these points should refer to the OMG BMM specification. Preface to Release 1.2 In September 2005, the Object Management Group (OMG) voted to accept the Business Motivation Model as the subject of a Request for Comment (RFC).  This means that the OMG is willing to consider the Business Motivation Model as a specification to be adopted by the OMG, subject to comment from any interested parties. Adoption as an OMG specification carries the intention that the Business Motivation Model would, in time, be submitted to the International Standards Organization (ISO) as a standard.                                                 1 Object Management Group, Business Motivation Model (BMM) Specification, Version 1.1, OMG (2010).

   Copyright, 2010.  The Business Rules Group vii Rel. 1.4  One of the OMG’s conditions for RFC acceptance was an explicit statement about attributes that would be required to be included in compliant implementations of the Business Motivation Model.  This has been included in Section 1.4. Preface to Release 1.1 The time lapse between Release 1.0 and Release 1.1 of the Business Motivation Model is just over four years.  The Model has shown remarkable stability during that period.  This brief Preface to Release 1.1 identifies the relatively small number of updates and improvements to the Model that the Business Rules Group (BRG) has made.  These changes were based on:  application of the Model in actual practice.  suggestions from various conferences and presentations in Europe and North America.  world-wide feedback via the BRG’s website.  intense work starting in 2003 on “Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules” (SBVR), a response to an RFP produced by the Object Management Group (OMG) entitled “Business Semantics of Business Rules.”3 Perhaps the most notable changes in Release 1.1 are (a) the new name for the Model itself, “The Business Motivation Model,” and (b) the new title of this document, “The Business Motivation Model ~ Business Governance in a Volatile World.”  The BRG received compelling arguments that the original name of the document, “Organizing Business Plans ~ The Standard Model for Business Rule Motivation,” did not accurately reflect the purpose and content of the Model.  These arguments were centered on two main points:  ‘Business Plan’ means many things to many people, and generally has broader connotations than the BRG intended.  For example, “schedule of planned business activities” comes to mind for some people, whereas “proposed plan created to attract venture capital” comes to mind for others.  Rather, the focus of the Model is on the elements of business governance (e.g., strategies, tactics, policies, goals, objectives, etc.); how these elements are inter-related; and what purposes they serve — i.e., their business motivation.  Although the Model does address the business motivation for business rules — after all, business rules are certainly an element of business governance — including ‘business rule’ in the title of the document gave it a prominence that outweighed its actual role.  In fact, as noted below, the Model does not even define Business Rule, but rather will adopt the definition from “Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules” (SBVR). As mentioned above, the structure of the Model in Release 1.1 has changed very little from Release 1.0.  The most significant adjustments involve sharpened definitions.  For example, a dictionary basis has been added for each term in the Model.4 Beyond that, several concepts have been renamed, and several fact types have been added or revised.  In addition, numerous examples have been added throughout the document.                                                 3 Submitted September 2005. 4 Two primary sources are used for this purpose: • New Oxford Dictionary of English [NODE]. • Merriam-Webster Unabridged Dictionary [MWUD]. 
The Business Motivation Model Business Governance in a Volatile World  
   Copyright, 2010.  The Business Rules Group viii Rel. 1.4  The only new concept added to the Model is a placeholder for Business Process.  The BRG has recognized the need to indicate how Business Process is related to the elements of the Model, and this placeholder permits it to do so.  By placeholder, the BRG emphasizes that it is not suggesting any standard view of Business Process; instead, that it intends to defer to other standards activities for relevant definition(s).  For example, work is currently being undertaken in the OMG to develop a standard Business Process Definition Metamodel (BPDM). The final noteworthy adjustment in Release 1.1 is that an outside definition has been adopted for ‘Business Rule’.  As noted earlier, the focus of this document is on the elements of business governance and, in the Model, Business Rules are viewed as simply one such element.  As in the case of the placeholder for Business Process, the adopted definition for Business Rule permits the BRG to indicate how Business Rules relate to other elements of the Model, but to defer to other standards activities for comprehensive definition and treatment.5  Preface to Release 1.06 Background In 1995, the Business Rules Group7 (BRG), then under the auspices of GUIDE International published a seminal work, “Defining Business Rules ~ What Are They Really?”  That document focused on understanding Business Rules from an information system perspective.  That work provides key insights on the basic structure of Business Rules — that is, what Business Rules really are.   Since 1997, the BRG has focused its energies on understanding Business Rules from a business perspective.  This in turn required a full, business-oriented understanding of how the elements of business plans should be organized.  The BRG found that although many professionals have used planning methodologies over the years, no standard existed in that area, and many of the basic concepts were hazy and ad hoc.  In particular, there was no inclusion of Business Rule in such approaches — a crucial omission.   This document presents the work of the BRG to correct these problems.  It reflects the consensus of the BRG — and collectively the members’ many years of practical experience — about business planning.  The BRG believes that business plans, especially as they relate to engineering business processes that include automated components, can and should be organized according to the elements of the Model presented in this document.                                                  5 For succinct discussion of the fundamental principles of the Business Rule approach, refer to the BRG’s Business Rules Manifesto (2003) available from http://www.businessrulesgroup.org.  The Manifesto is available in a variety of languages, including (as of this Release):  Chinese (Classic), Chinese (Simplified), Dutch, English, French, German, Lithuanian, Portuguese, Spanish, Swedish, and Turkish, with additional translations underway. 6 Originally published in 2000. 7 For more on the background and history of the BRG, refer to “A Brief History of the Business Rule Approach” 2nd ed., Business Rules Journal, Vol. 7, No. 11 (Nov. 2006); available from http://www.BRCommunity.com/a2006/b317.html

   Copyright, 2010.  The Business Rules Group ix Rel. 1.4  Organization of this Document This document centers on an explanation of the Model.  It begins by describing two major topical areas and the role they play.   Section 2 describes the major concepts of the Model in broad terms — Ends and Means, Influences, and Assessments of those Influences on the Ends and Means.   Sections 3 and 4 are the heart of the document, presenting Model concepts in detail.  As well as providing the concept descriptions that define the Model, these sections contain numerous examples.   Many of these examples are based on a (fictitious) car rentals company, EU-Rent, that continues the case study the BRG used in its earlier report.  Although there are individual examples drawn from other sources, EU-Rent8 provides at least one example of every concept, within the context of a single organization.  This provides some coherence across the examples and illustrates the relationships between many of the concepts.   The other examples were taken selectively from a wide set of enterprises.  While the BRG used real-world samples as the basis for these examples, it discovered that real-world samples often do not conform exactly to the prescriptions for the various concepts presented in this document.  The BRG found that the wording of these real-world statements is typically an amalgamation — using language designed for the consumption of vested audiences.  Therefore, the samples have been reworded as appropriate for use with the Model.  The BRG believes this is an important part of the value of its work.   Section 5 briefly discusses metrics in the context of the Model.  The Appendices Appendix A.  The Model is included in graphic form in Appendix A, which makes for handy reference.   Appendix B.  The real meaning of the concepts in the Model is in the concept definitions.  These definitions are an integral part of the Model — indeed, the Model diagram is meaningless without them.  Appendix B contains all the definitions in the form of a Glossary of Definitions, which the BRG prefers to call the Concepts Catalog9.   Appendix C.  The Model is diagrammatically presented in this document using neutral, non-normative conventions.  These conventions, explained in Appendix C, are intended only for visual illustration of the Model’s concepts and fact types.  Appendix D.  The document uses many examples from the EU-Rent case study, an overview of which is presented in Appendix D. Appendix E.  The positioning of the Model with respect to the Zachman Architecture Framework is discussed in Appendix E, which also comments on other artifacts of business models, including Organization Unit, Business Process, and Asset/Liability.                                                 8 The EU-Rent case study was developed by John Hall of Model Systems. 9 The “Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules” (SBVR) focuses on concepts, rather than merely on terms.  Therefore the Group prefers the name ‘Concepts Catalog’, rather than ‘Glossary of Definitions’.

   Copyright, 2010.  The Business Rules Group x Rel. 1.4  Appendix F.  A bibliography of relevant reference material is presented in Appendix F. Audiences for the Model Who are the audiences for the Model?  Primary audiences include the following:    Developers of business plans.   For that audience, the Model is a conceptual tool for engineering the business itself.    Analysts supporting the developers of business plans.   For that audience, the Model is a tool for organizing and clarifying business plans.  Implementers and users of software tools and repositories.   For that audience, the Model is a formal scheme for structuring information about such business plans.  A final point is this.  The BRG uses the word ‘enterprise’ in this document for convenience.  The enterprise can be either for-profit or not-for-profit — similar concepts apply.  Also, the ‘enterprise’ can be some subset of a larger enterprise; again, similar concepts should apply.

   Copyright, 2010.  The Business Rules Group 1 Rel. 1.4  1. Introduction The Business Motivation Model provides a scheme or structure for developing, communicating, and managing business plans in an organized manner.  Specifically, the Business Motivation Model does all of the following:  It identifies factors that motivate the establishing of business plans.    It identifies and defines the elements of business plans.  It indicates how all these factors and elements inter-relate.   Among these elements are ones that provide governance for and guidance to the business — Business Policies and Business Rules.   1.1 What is the Business Motivation Model? There are two major areas of the Business Motivation Model.    The first is the Ends and Means of business plans.  Among the Ends are things the enterprise wishes to achieve — for example, Goals and Objectives.  Among the Means are things the enterprise will employ to achieve those Ends — for example, Strategies, Tactics, Business Policies, and Business Rules.    The second is the Influencers that shape the elements of the business plans, and the Assessments made about the impacts of such Influencers on Ends and Means (i.e., Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats). The Ends, Means, and Influencers are related to each other in order to answer the following two fundamental questions: 1. What is needed to achieve what the enterprise wishes to achieve?  This question is answered by laying out the particular elements of the business plans — in other words, the Means necessary to achieve the desired Ends. 2. Why does each element of the business plan exist?  This question is answered by identifying the particular Ends that each of the Means serves, and the Influencers that underlie the choices made in this regard.  This is what is meant by motivation. All elements of the Business Motivation Model are developed from a business perspective.  The basic idea is to develop a business model for the elements of the business plans before system design or technical development is begun.  In this manner, the business plans can become the foundation for such activity, connecting system solutions firmly to their business intent. The Business Motivation Model contains:   A set of built-in concepts that define the elements of business plans.  They are associated in a structure that is methodology-neutral; it will support a range of approaches for creating and maintaining a Business Motivation Model for an enterprise, and is particularly strong in support of processes that are driven by business change.  Roles in the structure for three essential concepts:  Business Process, Business Rule, and Organization Unit.  They participate in associations within the Business Motivation Model, but also (it is assumed) in other associations outside  its scope — as is the case in 
The Business Motivation Model Business Governance in a Volatile World  
   Copyright, 2010.  The Business Rules Group 2 Rel. 1.4  SBVR101and the submissions for BPMN11 and OSM12.  They are regarded as references to elements that will be defined and maintained outside an enterprise’s Business Motivation Model. The Business Motivation Model is simple.  Its concepts have only basic attributes — identifier and text description.  Most of  its associations are unconstrained:  optional and many-to-many. Software tools that support the Business Motivation Model usually provide simple recording and reporting functionality, with some analysis capabilities (e.g., reporting of goals that are not quantified by objectives, business rules that are not derived from any business policy). The Business Motivation Model is not:  A specification for a business development management process or tool.  A specification for a project definition or management process or tool.  A specification for a full business model. It could be included in such specifications, but that is beyond the scope of this one.  1.2 Other Elements of a Full Business Model The Business Motivation Model is not a full business model.  For example, the elements of business plans do not prescribe in detail any of the following, each of which is an essential part of a full business model.    Business Processes.  Business plans include Courses of Action — what the enterprise has to do to achieve its Ends — transformed into Business Processes that encompass activities, sequencing, dependencies, interactions, triggering by business events, etc.  Business Process specification is outside the scope of business plans.  However the Business Motivation Model does include a placeholder for Business Process, to provide for integration with emerging Business Process standards.  Workflows.  The basis of workflow is assignment of responsibilities for Business Processes to roles in the organization.  Design of workflow is outside the scope of business plans.  However, the business plans may include Strategies or Tactics that configure organization structure to achieve effective workflow.  Business Vocabulary.  Also needed is full specification of the terms and facts needed to support the business.13  However, the business plans do provide a business basis for such development — namely, the concepts and vocabulary used in the elements of the business plans, particularly in its Business Rules. Refer to Appendix E (Section E.2) for comments about additional elements of a full business model.                                                 10 OMG Adopted Specification “Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules”   11 OMG Adopted Specification “Business Process Modeling and Notation” 12 OMG RFP “Organization Structure Metamodel”  13 Organizing Business Vocabulary is the focus of  “Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules” (SBVR).

   Copyright, 2010.  The Business Rules Group 3 Rel. 1.4  1.3 Business Rules in the Business Motivation Model Business Rules play an important role in development of business plans.  For example, they can serve the following purposes:  Make business tactics sufficiently well developed to guide the actual performance of work.  Provide fallback positions when some element of the business plans fails.    Resolve conflicts when the Ends the business seeks are in conflict with one another. Because of this key role — which is often make-or-break for the very success of business plans — developing the motivation for Business Rules from the business perspective is fundamentally important. 1.4 Methodologies and the Business Motivation Model It is important to note that the Business Motivation Model is not in any sense a methodology.  Indeed, it is entirely neutral with respect to methodology or particular approach, with only several general exceptions as follows:  The requirements development process should be business-driven.  Organized business plans should be a fundamental deliverable in any such process.  Business Rules and Business Processes are key elements of such business plans. One way to think of the Business Motivation Model is as a blueprint purposely designed to support a range of methodological approaches.  Implementation of the Model would result in the elements of business plans being stored and related to other information about the enterprise, no matter what methodology was used for discovering and defining them.  In the design for any such implementation, each concept of the Business Motivation Model (i.e., each concept listed in the Concepts Catalog) should be assigned two attributes — ‘name’ and ‘description’ — to be included in the implementation.  User enterprises and repository vendors could, of course, choose to include additional attributes. 1.5 Beneficiaries of the Business Motivation Model  Three types of people are expected to benefit from the Business Motivation Model:  Developers of business plans, Business modelers, and Implementers of software tools and repositories. 1.5.1 Developers of Business Plans The Business Motivation Model is a conceptual tool for engineering the business itself.  It provides developers of business plans with:  •  A set of concepts that acts as a check-list of factors to be considered  •  A standard vocabulary  •  A flexible model to support their development processes  They also use tools that implement the Business Motivation Model for storage and management of their business plans.

The Business Rules Group 4 Rel. 1.4  1.5.2 Business Modelers Modelers who develop detailed business models will, in the future, use standards and models based on the OMG’s specifications for BPMN, SBVR, and OSM. The Business Motivation Model will support them in two ways: 3. The content of their enterprise’s Business Motivation Model will help to guide and shape their more detailed models. 4. Eventually specifications such as BPMN, SBVR, and OSM together with the Business Motivation Model (or something with similar scope) should be merged into a single business-oriented modeling architecture, and implemented in integrated tool suites.  Until then, tools based on the Business Motivation Model could provide a straightforward way of relating business processes, business rules, and organization units to each other, and to the desired results, courses of action and business policies that affect them. 1.5.3 Implementers of Software Tools and Repositories  The Business Motivation Model provides the basis of a logical data design that has been implemented in the databases of tools that support the model.   Tool developers might also choose:  To elaborate on the Business Motivation Model, with additional attributes, more-normalized entities, and more-refined associations.   To use the Business Motivation Model in specifications of tools that support models with broader scope than the Business Motivation Model. Both of these are beyond the scope of this specification. 1.6 Placeholders Four concepts (Asset, Organization Unit, Business Process, and Business Rule) have roles in the structure of the Business Motivation Model but actually belong in other OMG standards, where they are defined and associated with related concepts needed for detailed business modeling. The defaults for the required external standards are the OMG’s specifications for the Organization Structure Metamodel (OSM), Business Process Modeling and Notation (BPMN), and Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules  (SBVR).  In practice, enterprises could use alternative external standards. Business Rule is a core concept of the BMM (albeit that its definition is adopted from SBVR).  Organization Unit and Business Process  (discussed in Appendix E) are placeholders for association with concepts in OSM and BPMN respectively.  Assets (also discussed in Appendix E) are not yet referenced to any particular OMG specifications.

   Copyright, 2010.  The Business Rules Group 5 Rel. 1.4  2. Overview of the Business Motivation Model Fundamental to the Business Motivation Model is the notion of motivation.  If an enterprise prescribes a certain approach for its business activity, it ought to be able to say why; that is, what result(s) the approach is meant to achieve.  Sometimes it is difficult to uncover such motivation, especially in operations that have been going on for some time.  All too often it turns out to be “...because we had to find a workaround for a system that didn’t do quite what was needed.”  This may describe business work practice, information systems, or both.  A cornerstone of any work addressing motivation had to be the enterprise’s aspirations (its Vision) and its action plans for how to realize them (its Mission).  Refinements were introduced — Vision into Goals and Objectives, and Mission into Strategies for approaching Goals, and Tactics for achieving Objectives.  The general term End was adopted to refer broadly to any of the ‘aspiration’ concepts (Vision, Goal, Objective) and the term Means to refer generally to any of the ‘action plan’ concepts (Mission, Strategy, Tactic).  This conjunction of Ends and Means — being and doing — provides the core concepts of the Model.14   An enterprise, however, cannot operate on this Model alone — the business needs to take into account the numerous Influencers that can hinder or assist its operation.  These Influencers provide Opportunities that would help the enterprise operate, as well as Threats that would thwart it.  Influencers also represent Strengths from within that the enterprise could exploit, or Weaknesses that it should compensate for.   But is an Influencer inherently a Strength or Weakness — is it always a Threat or Opportunity?  That determination comes from an Assessment of the impact of an Influencer on the stated Ends and Means — an Assessment such as is developed in SWOT analysis.15  In this commonly-used technique, Internal Influencers (assessed to be Strengths and Weaknesses) and External Influencers (assessed to be Opportunities and Threats) are analyzed as a part of business plan development.16   Once an Assessment has identified relevant Influencers in terms of their impact on Ends and Means, Directives (Business Policies and Business Rules) can be put in place to govern and guide the enterprise Courses of Action.  Directives keep the enterprise on course and moving toward its Desired Results.  Because of their integral role in guiding Courses of Action, Directives are included in the set of Means concepts. Business Rules are noteworthy in that regard.  Business Rules sharpen the Business Tactics because they make Courses of Action concrete at the operational level.  Business Rules can also provide specific remedies when a Course of Action fails, and specific resolutions to conflicts that                                                 14 In fact, this is the essential distinction between Ends (the being — “what you aspire to be”) and Means (the doing — “the actions you intend to take to get there”).  We express this distinction in our terms ‘Desired Result’ and ‘Course of Action’. 15 Note that SWOT is an example of a well-established technique: other techniques (and specializations of Assessment) may be substituted — but they should be adequate replacements for SWOT. 16 Neal Fishman, “SWOT Assessment,” DataToKnowledge Newsletter, Volume 27, No. 6 (November/December 1999), pp. 3-4.

In short, Business Rules provide the leverage needed for building effective, adaptable business solutions and systems.   Understanding the motivation for Business Rules is crucial in that regard.   When a Business Rule is encountered, you can ask where it would fit — which Influencer, on which End or Means, does it address?    When a Business Rule does not seem to fit, it can be challenged.  Does it perhaps support some older Means or End that is no longer relevant to the enterprise?  Was it a workaround for some historical information system deficiency or organizational issue that is no longer relevant?   The next section examines each of the concepts of the Business Motivation Model in detail to reveal how they work together to provide this kind of support.

   Copyright, 2010.  The Business Rules Group 7 Rel. 1.4  3. The Core Elements of the Business Motivation Model The main elements of the business plans are its Ends and Means.  These fundamental terms represent two hierarchies, as shown in Figures 3-1 and 3-5. 3.1 The End Concepts An End is something the business seeks to accomplish.  The important thing to remember about an End is that it does not include any indication of how it will be achieved. In describing Ends, it is useful to document who defined the End and at what point in time, so that an audit trail exists for future reference.  This, of course, cannot always be mandated. Categories of End End concepts can be arranged in a hierarchy, as shown in Figure 3-1. 
 Figure 3-1.  The Hierarchy of ‘End’ Concepts An End may be either a Vision or some Desired Result (a Goal or an Objective).  The essence is that these are kinds of things, in varying detail, that the enterprise is trying to accomplish.   Vision is an overall image of what the organization wants to be or become.  It usually encompasses the entire organization and is long-term in its perspective.  Desired Results, on the other hand, are the more specific Goals and Objectives that the enterprise, or some part of it, intends to achieve.   
The Business Motivation Model Business Governance in a Volatile World  
   Copyright, 2010.  The Business Rules Group 8 Rel. 1.4  Vision A Vision describes the future state of the enterprise, without regard to how it is to be achieved.   A Vision is the ultimate, possibly unattainable, state the enterprise would like to achieve.  A Vision is often compound, rather than focused toward one particular aspect of the business problem.  A Goal, in contrast, should generally be attainable and should be more specifically oriented to a single aspect of the business problem.   A Vision is supported or made operative by Missions.  It is amplified by Goals.   
 Figure 3-2.  Vision Examples of Vision include the following:    Vision EU-Rent Be the car rental brand of choice for business users in the countries in which we operate  Pizza Company Be the city’s favorite pizza place. Consulting Company  Be the premier consulting company in the industry. Retail Pharmacy  Be the low-cost health care provider with the best customer service. Municipal Police Department Be a professional, trusted provider of police services — a leader in cooperative efforts with the neighborhood and other agencies to make our city safer.   Desired Result A Desired Result is an End that is a state or target that the enterprise intends to maintain or sustain.  A Desired Result is supported by Courses of Action. Categories of Desired Result Desired Result includes the following concepts:  Goal  Objective 
The Business Motivation Model Business Governance in a Volatile World  
   Copyright, 2010.  The Business Rules Group 9 Rel. 1.4  
 Figure 3-3.  Desired Results — Goals and Objectives Compared to an Objective, a Goal tends to be longer term, qualitative (rather than quantitative), general (rather than specific), and ongoing.  Compared to a Goal, an Objective tends to be short term, quantitative (rather than qualitative), specific (rather than general), and not continuing beyond its timeframe (which may be cyclical).   Objectives differ from Goals in that Objectives should always be time-targeted and measurable.  Goals, in contrast, are not specific in these ways.    Desired Results are supported by Courses of Action, which can be either Strategies or Tactics.  Generally, Goals are supported by Strategies, and Objectives are achieved by Tactics.17 In many enterprises there is a continuum from major Strategies that impact the whole of the business to minor Tactics with limited, local effects.  The dividing line between ‘minor Strategy’ and ‘major Tactic’ is blurred.  Also, over time, some Courses of Action may evolve from Tactic to Strategy, and some Strategies may devolve into Tactics.  Some enterprises do make a hard distinction between Strategies and Tactics; these enterprises may choose to pair Strategies only with Goals, and Tactics only with Objectives.   Other enterprises use other bases for distinguishing Strategies and Tactics.  For example, some enterprises distinguish between Strategy and Tactic based on planning horizon.  In this case, Strategies are put into place to support the long-term Goals — i.e., a planning horizon that is typically several years or more — while Tactics are the Courses of Action implemented to deal with the shorter planning horizon of a year or less (the current operational plans).  Still other enterprises distinguish Strategy (a Course of Action that is for “the gaining of a specific advantage”) from Tactic, which is a Course of Action that is for “the deployment of specific resources to gain that advantage.”                                                 17 An enterprise that prefers to strictly maintain this pairing can do so by specifying an appropriate constraint.  It may also want to specialize the Model for its own use by replacing the fact type ‘Desired Result is supported by Course of Action’ with two more specific fact types:  Goal is supported by Strategies  Objective is achieved by Tactics 
The Business Motivation Model Business Governance in a Volatile World  
   Copyright, 2010.  The Business Rules Group 10 Rel. 1.4  Goal A Goal is a statement about a state or condition of the enterprise to be brought about or sustained through appropriate Means.  A Goal amplifies a Vision — that is, it indicates what must be satisfied on a continuing basis to effectively attain the Vision.   A Goal should be narrow — focused enough that it can be quantified by Objectives.  A Vision, in contrast, is too broad or grand for it to be specifically measured directly by Objectives.  However, determining whether a statement is a Vision or a Goal is often impossible without in-depth knowledge of the context and intent of the business planners. Examples of Goal include the following:  Goal EU-Rent To be a ‘premium brand’ car rental company, positioned alongside companies such as Hertz and Avis  To provide industry-leading customer service.  To provide well-maintained cars.  To have vehicles available for rental when and where customers expect them. Pizza Company To deliver pizzas in an expedient amount of time. Consulting Company  To improve customer satisfaction (over the next five years). Publishing Company To improve customer satisfaction (over the next five years). E-Business Company To have more customers than any other e-business.   Objective An Objective is a statement of an attainable, time-targeted, and measurable target that the enterprise seeks to meet in order to achieve its Goals.    Attainable.  It is self-evident that Objectives should be attainable.  If they are not, the business plans are unrealistic and will likely fail.  Time-targeted.  All Objectives should be time-targeted.  This means that either an absolute timeframe (e.g., “by January 1, 2007”) or relative timeframe (e.g., “within two years”) should be included in each Objective.  This timeframe indicates when the Objective is to be met.   Measurable.  Objectives should be measurable.  This means they must include some explicit criteria for determining whether the Objective is being met in practice.  This criteria may be fairly exacting (for example, “on-time 95% of the time”).  At the very minimum, the criteria must provide a basis for making a “yes or no” determination (e.g., “up and running”).  Such criteria may be the basis for certain Business Rules, created specifically to compute or derive the relevant evaluation. This understanding of ‘Objective’ is consistent with the industry’s popular “SMART” criteria that an Objective be:  Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-Based.   
The Business Motivation Model Business Governance in a Volatile World  
   Copyright, 2010.  The Business Rules Group 11 Rel. 1.4  Statements of Objective should always begin with the time-targeted phrase, followed by a quantified noun.   Example time-targeted phrases: • By 09/01/2001, ... • Effective immediately, ... • After 2 years, ... • Within 5 weeks, ... • On or before June 1, 2002, ... • On April 15, 2001, ... An Objective quantifies a Goal — that is, it provides the basis for measures to determine whether the Goal is being achieved.  Conversely, the Goal is quantified by these measurable Objectives.  For example, the Goal “To provide industry-leading customer service” is quantified by the Objective “Effective immediately, a ranking of 8 or better on a monthly customer satisfaction scale of 1-10” and by the Objective “By Jan. 1, 2001, a B+ grade level on the annual Better Business Bureau ratings.” Examples of Objective include the following:    Objective EU-Rent By end of current year, be rated by A C Nielsen:  in the top 6 car rental companies in each operating country within the European Community  in the top 9 car rental companies in all other operating countries   By end of current year, to score 85% on EU-Rent’s quarterly customer satisfaction survey.  During 4th quarter of current year, no more than 1% of rentals need the car to be replaced because of mechanical breakdown (excluding accidents).    During 4th quarter of current year, 98% of customers who ask to rent a car get one Pizza Company By January 1, 2005, 95% on-time pizza delivery.   Consulting Company By June 30, 2005, an operational customer call center. E-Business Company Within six months, 10% increase in product sales.

   Copyright, 2010.  The Business Rules Group 12 Rel. 1.4  Facts that Organize Ends Besides those mentioned above, other logical connections (i.e., fact types) are required to fully organize the Ends.  These logical connections provide additional structure among elements of the Ends themselves.   Interrelating Desired Results One Desired Result can include other Desired Results; a Desired Result can be included in some other Desired Result.  In other words, there can be a ‘parts explosion’ of Desired Results.  This connection should only be used to associate like instances — that is, Goals only to other Goals and Objectives only to other Objectives. 
 Figure 3-4.  Interrelating Desired Results A ‘parts explosion’ of Desired Results happens when there is a decomposition of some higher-level Goal (or Objective) into lower-level Goals (or Objectives).  Such decomposition occurs, for example, when elements of the business plans created by one level of management are handed down to a lower organizational level for more detailed planning or implementation.  This creates a ‘recursion’ among the elements, from higher level to lower level.  For example, the Goal “To keep customers satisfied” is composed of the sub-Goal “To deliver pizzas in an expedient amount of time” and the sub-Goal “To produce tasty pizzas.”   3.2 The Means Concepts A Means represents any device, capability, regime, technique, restriction, agency, instrument, or method that may be called upon, activated, or enforced to achieve Ends.  Remember that a Means does not indicate either the steps (business processes and workflow) necessary to exploit it, nor responsibility for such tasks, but rather only the capabilities that can be exploited to achieve the desired Ends.   In describing Means, it is useful to document who established the Means and at what point in time, so that an audit trail exists for future reference.  This practice, of course, cannot always be mandated. 
The Business Motivation Model Business Governance in a Volatile World  
   Copyright, 2010.  The Business Rules Group 13 Rel. 1.4  Categories of Means Means concepts can be arranged in a hierarchy, as shown in Figure 3-5. 
 Figure 3-5.  The Hierarchy of ‘Means’ Concepts A Means may be either a Mission, a Course of Action (a Strategy or Tactic), or a Directive (Business Policy or Business Rule).   Mission, like its counterpart Vision, indicates a correspondingly long-term approach — one that is focused on achieving the Vision.  Like Vision, Mission is not very specific; it is something broadly stated, in terms of the overall functioning of the enterprise.   Apart from the basic Mission of the enterprise, the Means of the Business Motivation Model have been carefully organized into Courses of Action and Directives.   In some respects, Courses of Action are the more basic of the two.  In and of themselves, however, Courses of Action tend to be rather blunt instruments.  They require Directives to have any real chance of success.   In contrast to Courses of Action, Directives cannot really stand on their own.  They exist to give the Courses of Action a fine edge — in other words, to ensure that the Courses of Action will be applied intelligently and within the boundaries of what is acceptable or optimal for the enterprise.  In short, Directives represent encoded (i.e., written down) knowledge that ensures the highest possible chances of success for the Courses of Action.   A Directive always has to do with governance or guidance.  A Course of Action, in contrast, identifies an active approach in moving toward the Ends.  A Course of Action is always action-dominated (action-oriented).   
The Business Motivation Model Business Governance in a Volatile World  
   Copyright, 2010.  The Business Rules Group 14 Rel. 1.4  Mission A Mission indicates the ongoing operational activity of the enterprise.  The Mission describes what the business is or will be doing on a day-to-day basis.   A Mission makes a Vision operative — that is, it indicates the ongoing activity that makes the Vision a reality.  A Mission is planned by means of Strategies.   
 Figure 3-6.  Mission A Mission statement should consist of the following three items only and should be formed using brief statements of them. 1. An action part.   For example, “provide”  2. A product or service part.   For example, “pizzas” 3. A market or customer part.   For example, “customers city-wide” The Mission statement should be focused on day-to-day operations, generic enough to cover all Strategies, and broad enough to cover the complete area of operations.   Examples of Mission include the following:    Mission EU-Rent Provide car rental service across Europe and North America for both business and personal customers. Pizza Company Provide pizza to customers city-wide. Consulting Company  Provide consulting, outsourcing, and staff augmentation services to companies in North America. Retail Pharmacy  Provide generic and ethical drugs to the retail market.

   Copyright, 2010.  The Business Rules Group 15 Rel. 1.4  Course of Action A Course of Action is an approach or plan for configuring some aspect of the enterprise involving things, processes, locations, people, timing, or motivation, undertaken to achieve Desired Results.  In other words, a Course of Action channels efforts towards Desired Results.  To help ensure success in this regard, Courses of Action are governed by Directives. Courses of Action, which include Strategies and Tactics, represent the basic elements of a general plan or overall solution — in other words, an overall approach — that the enterprise will take to achieve its Desired Results.  It is important to remember that Courses of Action are not Business Processes; rather, Courses of Action can be realized by Business Processes — that is, made operative by Business Processes. Categories of Course of Action Course of Action includes the following concepts:  Strategy  Tactic 
 Figure 3-7.  Course of Action Compared to Tactics, Strategies tend to be longer term and broader in scope.  A Strategy is implemented by Tactics.  Strategies usually channel efforts towards Goals, rather than Objectives. Compared to a Strategy, a Tactic tends to be shorter term and narrower in scope.  Tactics implement Strategies; they are courses of action that will support those Strategies.  Tactics generally channel efforts towards Objectives, rather than Goals.   Determining whether a Course of Action is a Strategy or a Tactic may be impossible without in-depth knowledge of the context and intent of the business planners.  In fact, in the course of developing and analyzing business plans, some elements may change category as the target problem is understood better.  For example, an element originally defined as a Tactic may subsequently be elevated to a Strategy.  The reverse is also likely to occur.  In other words, the business plans will gradually evolve toward greater accuracy in specification, as well as greater coherence and completeness. 
The Business Motivation Model Business Governance in a Volatile World  
   Copyright, 2010.  The Business Rules Group 16 Rel. 1.4  Strategy A Strategy is one component of the plan for the Mission.  A Strategy represents the essential Course of Action to achieve Ends — Goals in particular.  A Strategy usually channel efforts towards those Goals. A Strategy is more than simply a resource, skill, or competency that the enterprise can call upon; rather, a Strategy is accepted by the enterprise as the right approach to achieve its Goals, given the environmental constraints and risks. Examples of Strategy include the following:    Strategy EU-Rent Operate nation-wide in each country of operation, focusing on major airports, competing head-to-head, on-airport, with other premium car rental companies.  Manage car purchase and disposal at local area level, with national (operating country) guidance covering:   What models may be bought from which manufacturers;  Overall numbers and mix of models;  When to dispose of cars, by mileage and age;  Phasing of purchasing and delivery.  Join an established rewards scheme run by a third party (i.e., outsource rather than building own scheme). Pizza Company Deliver pizzas to the location of the customer’s choice. Consulting Company  Implement a Customer Relationship Management System.  Increase repeat business. E-Business Company Buy other e-business mailing lists. 
The Business Motivation Model Business Governance in a Volatile World  
   Copyright, 2010.  The Business Rules Group 17 Rel. 1.4  Tactic A Tactic is a Course of Action that represents part of the detailing of Strategies.  A Tactic implements Strategies.  For example, the Tactic “Call first-time customers personally” implements the Strategy “Increase repeat business.” Tactics generally channel efforts towards Objectives.  For example, the Tactic “Ship products for free” channels efforts towards the Objective “Within six months, 10% increase in product sales.”   Examples of Tactic include the following:    Tactic EU-Rent Encourage rental extensions.  Outsource maintenance for small branches.  Create standard specifications of car models, selecting from options offered by the manufacturers  Note:  these will be trade-offs between ‘rentable’ and ‘high residual value for sales’.  Equalize use of cars across rentals so that mileage is similar for cars of the same car group and age  Comply with car manufacturer’s maintenance schedules Pizza Company Hire drivers with their own vehicles to deliver pizzas. Consulting Company  Provide each member of the sales force with a palmtop.  Call first-time customers personally. E-Business Company Ship products for free. 
The Business Motivation Model Business Governance in a Volatile World  
   Copyright, 2010.  The Business Rules Group 18 Rel. 1.4  Directive As the name suggests, Directives indicate how the Courses of Action should, or should not, be carried out — in other words, they govern Courses of Action.  Specifically, a Directive defines or constrains or liberates some aspect of an enterprise.  It is intended to assert business structure or to control or influence the behavior of the business, and is stated in declarative form.  
 Figure 3-8.  Interrelating Directives with Courses of Action and Ends Directives govern Courses of Action.  For example, the Business Rule “Pizzas may not be delivered beyond a radius of 30 miles” governs the Strategy “Deliver pizzas to the location of the customer’s choice.”  This governance applies to Tactics as well.  For example, the Tactic “Encourage rental extensions” is governed by the Business Policy “Allow extension of rentals by phone.”   It is expected that all Courses of Action should be governed by some Directive, especially as the business plans evolve and become more coherent and complete.  Any Course of Action not governed by a Directive should be examined carefully to discover potential omissions.   On the other hand, having too many Directives may become unduly constraining.  The correct balance in this regard can only be identified by having in-depth knowledge of the context and intent of the business people participating in the planning.   In striking this balance it should be remembered that, unless a Directive is made explicit, it is assumed that no constraint on other elements of the business plans will be exercised.  ‘Unstated’ Directives simply cannot be addressed in the Model — quite literally, they can be recognized only by stating them.18  To be taken into account within the Model, every Directive must be explicit and recorded in an official manner.19                                                     18 For Business Policies in particular, this represents a de facto boundary between Model and methodology.  The BRG recognizes that to be workable, a practical methodology must address the reality of implicit Business Policies within the business. 19 Making Business Rules explicit is a fundamental principle of the Business Rule approach.  Refer to the Business Rule Manifesto. 
The Business Motivation Model Business Governance in a Volatile World  
   Copyright, 2010.  The Business Rules Group 19 Rel. 1.4  It is also possible for the Courses of Action to be formulated based on Directives.  For example, the Tactics ‘Comply with manufacturer’s maintenance schedules’ and ‘Equalize use of cars across rentals so that mileage is similar for cars of the same car group and age’ are both formulated based on the Business Policy ‘Depreciation of cars must be minimized’.  The Directive thereby serves as the source of the Course of Action.  Occasionally a Directive is defined to support the achievement of a Desired Result directly.  For example:  The Business Policy “The cell phone numbers of customer representatives should be available to customers” supports achieving the Goal “To provide high-quality customer support.”    The Objective “Within six months, 10% increase in product sales” is supported by this Business Rule that defines product sales:  “Product sales must be computed as total sales, minus all of the following:  sales tax, shipping charges, and maintenance contract fees.” Business Rule Enforcement Level A Business Rule that guides behavior20 has an enforcement level.  Enforcement levels represent alternatives in a graded or ordered scale, each of which indicates the severity of action imposed to put or keep a rule in force.  An example of a range of enforcement levels21 — from ‘strictly enforced’ to ‘guideline’ — is:   Value Meaning strictly enforced If the rule is violated, the penalty is always applied.   deferred enforcement Strictly enforced, but enforcement may be delayed — e.g., waiting for resource with required skills.   pre-authorized override Enforced, but exceptions allowed, with prior approval for actors with before-the-fact override authorization. post-justified override If not approved after the fact, you may be subject to sanction or other consequences. override with explanation Comment must be provided when the violation occurs. guideline Suggested, but not enforced. 
                                                20 Only Business Rules that guide behavior (SBVR ‘operative business rule’) require enforcement.  Definitional Business Rules (SBVR ‘structural business rule’) are “true by definition”. 21 From the OMG specification for “Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules” (SBVR).

The Business Rules Group 20 Rel. 1.4  Examples of enforcement level include the following:    Directive Enforcement Level EU-Rent A EU-Rent agent who is found, after a managerial review, to have rented a vehicle to a customer without a valid driver’s license, is to be fired. strictly enforced Pizza Company A driver who is convicted of one moving traffic violation while driving for the company will be counseled by a manager concerning safe driving. pre-authorized override E-Business Company A customer rated negative by more than ten other customers will be blocked forever from doing business. override with explanation Deciding what enforcement level is to be applied to a Business Rule is often a Tactic within business plans.  In the Model, Tactic effects enforcement level of Business Rule.

The Business Motivation Model Business Governance in a Volatile World  
   Copyright, 2010.  The Business Rules Group 21 Rel. 1.4  Directive as Regulation A Directive may act as some other Organization Unit’s Regulation.  The Business Rules and Business Policies determined at one level in an organization may be effectively the law (Regulation) for lower-level organizations.   
 Figure 3-10.  Directive as Regulation For example, production and sales divisions both have to comply with company policy on safety at work.  These units in turn have to determine their own local policies and rules for their particular compliance with the ‘law’ (company policy) imposed from above.  Furthermore, the rules and policies they come up with will most likely be unique; rules for safety within the production division are different from those in sales.   Categories of Directive Directive includes the following concepts:  Business Policy  Business Rule Compared to a Business Rule, a Business Policy tends to be less structured,22 less discrete, and usually not atomic — that is, not focused on a single aspect of governance or guidance.  Also compared to a Business Rule, a Business Policy tends to be less compliant with standard business vocabulary, and less formally23 articulated.   In contrast to a Business Policy, a Business Rule is highly structured17 and is carefully expressed in terms of standard vocabulary.  A Business Rule should be discrete and atomic — that is, represent only a single aspect of governance or guidance.   Business Policies provide broader governance or guidance that is not directly enforceable.  Business Rules provide specific, practicable governance or guidance to implement Business Policies.  ‘Practicable’ means that a person who understands a Business Rule could observe a relevant situation (including his or her own behavior) and decide directly whether or not the business was complying with the rule. Some Business Rules could be automated in software; some can be applied only by people.  Business Policies are not directly automatable.                                                 22 This means ‘structured’ in a natural language sense, not ‘structured’ in any technical sense.   23 ‘Less formally’ should not be interpreted as ‘less carefully’. 
The Business Motivation Model Business Governance in a Volatile World  
   Copyright, 2010.  The Business Rules Group 22 Rel. 1.4  Business Policy A Business Policy is a Directive that is not directly enforceable24 whose purpose is to govern or guide the enterprise.  Business Policies provide the basis for Business Rules.  Business Policies also govern Business Processes. The formulation of a Business Policy, which is always under the enterprise’s control, is by some party who is authorized to manage, control, or regulate the enterprise by selecting from a variety of alternatives in response to one or more Assessments.   Business Policies that exist merely to enable a Strategy in a direct and trivial manner should be avoided.  For example, suppose the enterprise has the Strategy “Encourage repeat business.”  A Business Policy that says “Repeat business should be encouraged” is trivial and does not need to be expressed.   In general, Business Policies exist to govern — that is, control, guide, and shape — the Strategies and Tactics.  For example, the Business Policy “We will not make on-site visits” governs the Strategy “Encourage repeat business,” as well as the specific Tactics that might be selected to implement the Strategy.  Specifically, no Tactic requiring on-site visits will be permitted to support the Strategy — even though on-site visits would probably be effective in that regard.  On the other hand, a Tactic involving sending coupons by mail would be acceptable under the Business Policy since it involves no on-site visits.

   Copyright, 2010.  The Business Rules Group 24 Rel. 1.4  Business Rule A Business Rule is a Directive, intended to govern, guide or influence business behavior, in support of Business Policy that has been formulated in response to an Opportunity, Threat, Strength, or Weakness.  It is a single Directive that does not require additional interpretation to undertake Strategies or Tactics.  Often, a Business Rule is derived from Business Policy.  Business Rules guide Business Processes. Formally, a Business Rule is a rule that is under business jurisdiction25.  A rule is a proposition that is a claim of obligation or of necessity.  The common sense understanding of ‘rule’ is that a rule always tends to remove some degree of freedom. Examples of Business Rule include the following:    Business Rule EU-Rent Each Car purchased must match the standard specification of its Car Model.  The Car assigned to a Rental must be:  at the time of assignment, of the available Cars in the requested Car Group, the one with the lowest mileage.  A customer must present a valid driver’s license in order to rent a EU-Rent vehicle.  A Car whose odometer reading is greater than (next service mileage — 200) must be scheduled for service.  A Rental cannot be extended by phone if the Car’s odometer reading is greater than (next service mileage — 500).  The rental of a car whose odometer reading is greater than (next service mileage — 500) may be extended only if the car is exchanged at a EU-Rent branch.  Every driver on a rental must be over 21 years old.   Pizza Company Pizzas must be delivered within one hour.    Pizzas may not be delivered beyond a radius of 30 miles.   E-Business Company The order tax amount must be calculated at the time the order is placed.    An order must not contain more than 25 order items.                                                 25 This definition is adopted from “Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules” (SBVR).

   Copyright, 2010.  The Business Rules Group 25 Rel. 1.4   Facts that Organize Means Besides those mentioned above, other logical connections (i.e., fact types) are required to fully organize the Means.  These logical connections provide additional structure among elements of the Means themselves. 
 Figure 3-11.  Facts Involving Means Interrelating Courses of Action — Composition One Course of Action can include other Courses of Action; a Course of Action can be included in other Courses of Action.  In other words, there can be a ‘parts explosion’ of Courses of Action.  This connection should only be used to associate like instances — that is, Strategies only to other Strategies and Tactics only to other Tactics.   Such ‘parts explosion’ happens when there is a decomposition of some higher-level Course of Action into lower-level Courses of Action.  This decomposition occurs, for example, when elements of the business plans created by one level of management are handed down to a lower organizational level for more detailed planning or implementation.  This creates a ‘recursion’ among the elements, from higher level to lower level.  For example, the Strategy “Ensure that the stock of available vehicles never falls below an acceptable level” is composed of sub-Strategies appropriate to each geographic region.   Interrelating Courses of Action — Enabling One Course of Action can be enabled by another Course of Action.  In other words, the latter Course of Action provides basic support that makes the former Course of Action viable.  This connection should generally be used to associate like instances — that is, Strategies only to other Strategies and Tactics only to other Tactics.   
The Business Motivation Model Business Governance in a Volatile World  
   Copyright, 2010.  The Business Rules Group 26 Rel. 1.4  For example, the Strategy “Ensure that the stock of available vehicles never falls below an acceptable level” is enabled by the Strategy “Maintain vehicles in good working condition.”  For another example, the Tactic “Provide each member of the sales force with a palmtop” enables the Tactic “Input sales orders at the source.” Interrelating Business Policies One Business Policy can include other Business Policies; a Business Policy can be included in other Business Policies.  In other words, there can be a ‘parts explosion’ of Business Policies.  For example, the Business Policy “Safety first” can be decomposed into more specific policies that deal with vehicle safety and workplace safety.   3.3 Expressing Core Elements of the Business Motivation Model It is expected that statements an enterprise gives representing its Ends and its Directives will be laden with words that are judgmental, qualitative, and/or comparative.  Indeed, the inclusion of such words is one fundamental characteristic of these elements.   Examples of such words include the following. • Best • Biggest • Clear • Closest • Convenient • Courteous • Durable • Effective • Efficient • Expedient • Fast(est) • Leading-Edge • Low(est)-cost • Premier • Professional • Reliable • Responsive • Quickest These ‘qualitative’ (judgmental or comparative) words should be avoided in expressing Missions, Strategies, and Tactics when the words actually refer to a desired end-state.  Statements containing such words should be carefully analyzed and then re-stated as appropriate Desired Results or Directives.  Indeed, the absence of adjectives suggesting desired end-states is one fundamental way in which Courses of Action are distinguished from Desired Results and Directives.   However, qualitative words may be used in Courses of Action if the words do not refer to the end-state desired.  For example, the Tactic “ship products for free” includes the adjective ‘free.’  This is valid word usage in a Course of Action since it does not describe the Desired Result.   
The Business Motivation Model Business Governance in a Volatile World  
   Copyright, 2010.  The Business Rules Group 27 Rel. 1.4  4. Influencers and Assessments To fully understand the elements of business plans, it is necessary to identify the Influencers that shape them.  This helps communicate the full intent of the Means and Ends by explaining the context in which they were formulated.   Influencers, however, are neutral — they are more or less simply just ‘there’ until someone makes an Assessment about how they are likely to impact some End or Means.  Influencers should always be stated in a neutral, factual manner.  Therefore, Influencers should be devoid of qualitative words.  The presence of qualitative words indicates a statement about an Influencer — in other words, an Assessment.   This section describes the concepts that define these aspects of the Business Motivation Model.  Understanding these elements supports intelligent revision of the business plans, possibly well after the business plans and related application system(s) have been implemented.   4.1 Influencers on the Ends and Means Influencer An Influencer can be anything that has the capability to ‘produce an effect without apparent exertion of tangible force or direct exercise of command, and often without deliberate effort or intent.’  The Influencers specifically of concern to business plans are those that can impact the enterprise in its employment of Means or achievement of its Ends.  This impact has influence that is judged in Assessments.   Influencers should not simply be named but described as well.  Such amplification communicates sufficient background and/or contextual information for other planning participants to make appropriate, relevant Assessments. In describing Influencers, remember they are always neutral, and must be assessed to determine implications for business plans.  Suppose a statement is made that ostensibly describes some Influencer.  If it appears that a Business Rule can be derived directly from the statement, then the statement is almost certainly not an Influencer.  For example, consider the statement “The company color is blue.”  This leads directly to the Business Rule “Each web site screen must contain the company color blue.”  Because no Assessment needs to be made, the statement is of another kind — in this case mostly likely a Business Policy.    In describing Influencers, it is also useful to document who recognizes the Influencer and at what point in time, so that an audit trail exists for future reference.  This practice, of course, cannot always be mandated. 
The Business Motivation Model Business Governance in a Volatile World  
   Copyright, 2010.  The Business Rules Group 28 Rel. 1.4  Categories of Influencer Influencers impact an enterprise’s employment of Means or achievement of Ends.  There are two built-in categories of Influencer:   External:  an Influencer that is outside the enterprise's organizational boundaries    Internal:  an Influencer from within the enterprise.    
 Figure 4-1.  Concepts Reflecting Possible Influencers Beyond these, an enterprise can define whatever Influencer Categories it requires.  Enterprises that do not have a preferred set of categories may choose to use this default set, modifying and extending it as required.  This default set provides general categories that are used for examples and discussion in this specification.  It is suggested that each Influencer is categorized as (at least) one of the general categories and as either internal or external, as described in the following tables.  Influencer Categories may themselves be categorized in broader categories; a narrower category may be included in more than one broader category.  Management of consistency when Influencers are categorized in multiple categories is a matter for methodology, practice, and tools, and is beyond the scope of this specification.

   Copyright, 2010.  The Business Rules Group 29 Rel. 1.4  Example:  External Influencers External Influencers are those outside an enterprise’s organizational boundaries that can impact its employment of Means or achievement of Ends.  Influencer Categories usually also categorized as External Influencer include the following.   Competitor A rival enterprise in a struggle for advantage over the subject enterprise. Customer A role played by an individual or enterprise that has investigated, ordered, received, or paid for products or services from the subject enterprise. Environment The aggregate of surrounding conditions or Influencers affecting the existence or development of an enterprise. Partner An enterprise that shares risks and profit with the subject enterprise (or is associated with the subject enterprise to share risks and profit) because this is mutually beneficial. Regulation An order prescribed by an authority such as a government body or the management of an enterprise. Supplier A role played by an individual or enterprise that can furnish or provide products or services to the subject enterprise. Technology The role of technology, including its developments and limitations — there may be prerequisites for use of technology; there may be enterprise activity that technology enables or restricts. One Influencer Category, Regulation, is explicitly defined in the Model.  This supports the requirement (discussed above in “Directive as Regulation”) for Directive to be able to act as a Regulation within an enterprise.  This list of External Influencers is not necessarily exhaustive.  The enterprise may choose to add additional categories or even introduce its own categorization scheme (i.e., the list above is replaceable as a whole). Also, the categories are not necessarily mutually exclusive.  A particular instance of External Influencer actually may have more than one of these categories.

The Business Rules Group 35 Rel. 1.4  4.2 Assessing the Impact of Influencers on Ends and/or Means Influencers are neutral — they are more or less simply just ‘there’ until someone makes an Assessment of them as they relate to Ends and/or Means.  Such an Assessment represents a judgment about an Influencer with respect to its impact on Ends and/or Means.  Specifically, the Assessment indicates that the Influencer affects the employment of Means and/or the achievement of Ends, in certain ways.   
 Figure 4-2.  Concepts for Assessments of Influencers on Ends and/or Means If an Assessment is related to both a Means and an End, then this suggests that the particular Means is somehow related to the particular End.  Specifically, if there is not a fact relating them — such as ‘Course of Action channels efforts towards Desired Result’ or ‘Directive supports achievement of Desired Result’ —  then careful consideration should be given to that omission. Assessment An Assessment is a judgment about some Influencer that affects the organization’s ability to employ its Means or achieve its Ends.  In other words, an Assessment expresses a logical connection (i.e., fact type) between Influencers and the Ends and/or Means of the business plans.  In this way, an Assessment indicates which Influencers are relevant to which Ends and/or Means.   Different people or groups of people26 might make different Assessments of the very same Influencers on the very same Ends and Means — and perhaps even the same person or group of people at different points in time.  It is very important to indicate which person or group of people makes which Assessment of an Influencer at which point in time, so that an audit trail exists for future reference.  This practice, of course, cannot always be mandated.                                                   26 Organization Unit.

The Business Motivation Model Business Governance in a Volatile World  
   Copyright, 2010.  The Business Rules Group 36 Rel. 1.4  An Assessment can provide impetus for Directives that govern Courses of Action and/or support the achievement of Ends.  In other words, the Directive is motivated by the Assessment. 
 Figure 4-3.  Assessment and Directive Use of Assessments by Assessments Assessments can also use other assessments.  Typical use of this association is connecting an assessment to other assessments referenced while arriving at the judgment.  These associations can then be used for many purposes, including:  Decision support for making new assessments — identifying the full set of concerns taken into account in earlier assessments  Compliance audit — justifying decisions made in reacting to change 
The Business Motivation Model Business Governance in a Volatile World  
   Copyright, 2010.  The Business Rules Group 37 Rel. 1.4  Categories of Assessment The Business Motivation Model supports a general categorization structure for Assessment, as illustrated in Figure 4-4.  Categories of Assessment may themselves be categorized in broader categories; a narrower category may be included in  more than one broader category. SWOT — Strength, Weakness, Opportunity, Threat — is a frequently-used set of categories for Assessment.  There are other approaches, but if an enterprise does not have another preferred set, SWOT is a sound default.  SWOT is used as the illustrative approach for discussion and examples in the rest of this document. When applying SWOT to making assessments,27 Assessments are categorized as follows:    Strength  Weakness  Opportunity  Threat 
 Figure 4-4.  Categories of Assessment Strength This category of Assessment indicates some advantage or area of excellence within the enterprise that can impact its employment of Means or achievement of Ends.   Some examples of Strength Assessments are:   Strength Affects EU-Rent Infrastructure:  geographical distribution of branches Appeal to business customers.  Implicit corporate values:  environment-friendly, value rather than price — good positioning of EU-Rent, differentiating from competitors. Promotion to all customers as a ‘premium brand’.  Resource:  rental branch managers — ground-level leaders of the customer-facing business. Building branch networks around major cities and airports.                                                 27 As stated in Section 2, SWOT is one approach that can be used in making assessments.  The Model does not specify SWOT as the technique.  These categories of Assessment are illustrative. 
The Business Motivation Model Business Governance in a Volatile World  
   Copyright, 2010.  The Business Rules Group 38 Rel. 1.4  Weakness This category of Assessment indicates some area of inadequacy within the enterprise that can impact its employment of Means or achievement of Ends.   Some examples of Weakness Assessments are:  Weakness Affects EU-Rent The software for internet rentals has few facilities for self-service of corporate rental agreements — e.g., analyzing car usage by employees, removing people who have left their employment with the corporate customer. Appeal to businesses for corporate agreements.  High turnover of branch counter staff frequently causes shortage of experienced staff in branches.  This can cause delays in dealing with exceptions and problems. Provision of high- quality customer service. Opportunity This category of Assessment indicates that some Influencer can have a favorable impact on the organization’s employment of Means or achievement of Ends.  For example, the bankruptcy of Pizza Company’s major competitor in Region-Y is assessed to be an Opportunity in its Goal “To increase market share.”   Some examples of Opportunity Assessments are:  Opportunity Affects EU-Rent EU-Rent thinks there is room for competition in the ‘premium brand’ car rental market. Appeal to business users. Increase in rental rates.  Depreciation on cars between their purchase, new, and their sale at the end of their rental life is a critical factor in financial success. Improved management of depreciation would reduce costs.

   Copyright, 2010.  The Business Rules Group 39 Rel. 1.4  Threat This category of Assessment indicates that some Influencer can have an unfavorable impact on the organization’s employment of Means or achievement of Ends.     Some examples of Threat Assessments are:  Threat Affects EU-Rent Budget airlines provide low-cost flights to major cities, but using secondary airports where EU-Rent does not have branches Appeal to business users. Expansion into Eastern Europe.  Budget airlines offer a cost effective and faster alternative to car rental for short distances (say, up to 200 miles). Building ‘premium’ business from major airports.  Congestion charges in European city centers:  Discourage customers from renting cars in city centers  Increase EU-Rent operational costs when moving cars to and from city offices Positioning city offices — moving them outside congestion zones will reduce convenience for business customers.

   Copyright, 2010.  The Business Rules Group 40 Rel. 1.4  Potential Impact  An Assessment records judgments about the impact (or potential for impact) of some Influencer on Ends and/or Means in terms of Potential Impacts.  In other words, an Assessment identifies some Potential Impact(s) that is/are significant to that Assessment.  Each Potential Impact is an evaluation that quantifies or qualifies some aspect of an Assessment in specific terms, types, or dimensions.    A Potential Impact significant to an Assessment can provide impetus for Directives that govern Courses of Action or support the achievement of Ends.  An Influencer may lead to the creation of a Business Policy only through an Assessment having been made that identifies some Potential Impact. 
 Figure 4-5.  Assessment and Potential Impacts Categories of Potential Impact  Potential Impacts are categorized as follows:  Risk  Potential Reward Risks are typically regarded to be negative impacts, whereas Rewards are considered positive.   Where there is more than one Assessment associated with a single instance of an End or Means, the total impact should be evaluated to uncover tradeoffs between Risks and Potential Rewards.  This is the basis of risk/benefit analysis.   Risk A Risk is a category of Impact Value that indicates the impact and probability of loss.  Some Risks are expressible as formulae of the kinds:   • Probability of loss. (e.g., 5% probability) • Potential loss. (e.g., $500,000 loss) • Unit-of-measure. (e.g., loss in USD) 
The Business Motivation Model Business Governance in a Volatile World  
   Copyright, 2010.  The Business Rules Group 41 Rel. 1.4  Some examples of Risk are:    Assessment Risk EU-Rent Opportunity:  room for competition in the ‘premium brand’ car rental market. Failure to position EU-Rent as a premium brand risks loss of an estimated 15% of current customers without replacement by new customers.  Opportunity:  targeting business customers & increasing rental rates. Many unrented cars at weekends, with rates undercut by the ‘cheap and cheerful’ competition.  Threat:  stringent emission control requirements in Scandinavia — have to be met by any EU-Rent car that might be driven in Scandinavia. Severe financial penalties for failure to comply. Potential Reward A Potential Reward is a category of Potential Impact that indicates the probability of gain.  Some Potential Rewards are expressible as formulae of the kinds:   • Probability of gain. (e.g., 30% probability) • Potential gain. (e.g., $40,000 gain) • Unit-of-measure. (e.g., gain in USD) Some examples of Potential Reward are:    Assessment Potential Reward EU-Rent Opportunity:  room for competition in the ‘premium brand’ car rental market.   Market acceptance would support an average increase of 12% on rental rates.  In moving up-market, EU-Rent expects to replace at least 15% of its current customers.  Opportunity:  improved management of depreciation of cars. Reduction of depreciation costs by 3%.

   Copyright, 2010.  The Business Rules Group 42 Rel. 1.4  4.3  EU-Rent Example:  Reaction to Influencers EU-Rent needs to decide how it wants to position itself in the car rental market.  ‘Premium’ car rental companies, such as Hertz and Avis, have a ‘high quality, value for money’ image.  (These EU-Rent Competitors are External Influencers.)  Customers generally accept that the rates for premium companies will be higher than the ‘cheap and cheerful’ competition.  Customers tend to see ‘on-airport’ companies as premium, and ‘off-airport’ companies as cheap and cheerful.  (These Customers — determined by market research — are External Influencers for EU-Rent.)  EU-Rent thinks there is room for competition in the premium market.  (This is an Opportunity Assessment.)  EU-Rent decides that it wants to be a premium car rental company.  (This is a Goal.)  To achieve this, EU-Rent decides to be nation-wide in each of its countries of operation, focusing on major airports, and to compete head-to-head, on-airport, with other premium car rental companies.  (This is a Strategy.)  A problem for on-airport car rental companies is that all the competitors offer similar types of car, and are physically lined up in a row.  (This Environment is an External Influencer for EU-Rent.)  There is very little room for maneuver on product, service, or price.  (This is a Weakness Assessment.)  This on-airport constraint on pricing means that depreciation on cars between their purchase as new cars, and their sale at the end of their rental life will be a critical factor in financial success (This is an Opportunity Assessment.)  In response to this, EU-Rent decides that depreciation of cars must be minimized.  (This is a Business Policy.)  EU-Rent has a Strategy for car purchase and disposal, covering:  » What models to buy from which manufacturers. » What overall numbers and mix and cars to buy. » When to dispose of cars, by mileage and age. » How to phase purchasing and delivery of cars. » etc.  
The Business Motivation Model Business Governance in a Volatile World  
   Copyright, 2010.  The Business Rules Group 43 Rel. 1.4   Within this Strategy, EU-Rent develops Tactics28 for its “minimize depreciation” Business Policy, and Business Rules to govern and guide these Tactics.  For example:  Tactics Business Rules Create standard specifications of car models, selecting from options offered by the manufacturers — this is a trade-off between ‘rentable’ and ‘high residual value for sales’. Each Car purchased must match the standard specification of its Car Model. Equalize of use of cars across rentals. The Car assigned to a Rental must be:  at the time of assignment, of the available Cars in the requested Car Group, the one with the lowest mileage. Comply with manufacturer’s maintenance schedule. Any Car whose odometer reading is greater than (next service mileage — 200) must be scheduled for service.  A Rental cannot be extended by phone if the Car’s odometer reading is greater than (next service mileage — 500).  The Customer must bring it to a EU-Rent branch for a change of car. 
                                                28 These Tactics will be realized in Business Processes.  As before, however, the detailing of these Business Processes is outside the scope of the Model.

   Copyright, 2010.  The Business Rules Group 44 Rel. 1.4  5 Metrics for the Business Motivation Model Implicit in many areas of the Business Motivation Model is the subject of metrics.  In almost all organizations there are ‘things of interest’ that are heavily measured and tracked.29  These metrics govern, control, and influence a wide range of important aspects of the organization.  The very fact these ‘things’ are so heavily measured makes them important.   Some of the most important metrics of an enterprise are established by its Goals.  Each Goal can have one or more measures of performance.  For example, a metric of the Goal “To be profitable” is the measure of performance ‘annual net revenue.’  Another measure of performance of this Goal might be ‘monthly net revenue.’ Some of the example Goals presented earlier have been extended below to illustrate measures of performance:  Goal Measure(s) of Performance EU-Rent To provide industry-leading customer service. market share EU-Rent To provide well-maintained cars. quality of product EU-Rent To have vehicles available for rental when and where customers expect them. usage % order fulfillment Pizza Company To deliver pizzas in an expedient amount of time. elapsed time Consulting Company  To improve customer satisfaction (over the next five years). customer satisfaction Publishing Company To improve customer satisfaction (over the next five years). customer satisfaction E-Business Company To have more customers than any other e-business.   market share Objectives should always be measurable.  Therefore Objectives, by definition, will have metrics.  The metrics for an Objective are established by the measures of performance of the Goal that the Objective quantifies.  To be able to do this, an appropriate unit-of-measure for the metric must be determined for each Objective.  The Objective then expresses the target value that the metric should attain in the timeframe specified.  In that way, while a Goal sets the direction, its corresponding Objectives set the milestones to be attained in pursuing the Goal.  For example, to quantify the Goal “To be profitable” the enterprise might set one Objective to have a monthly net revenue of at least $5 million (by a specified date) and another Objective to have an annual net revenue of at least $100 million (by a specified date).   Metrics are imperative for Potential Impacts.  Without thoughtful and careful identification of appropriate metrics, the Risk / Potential Reward evaluation becomes meaningless.                                                   29 Rule management is outside of the scope of the Model; however, the enterprise should consider Business Rules to be one of the ‘things of interest’ that it carefully ‘measures and tracks’.  Management of rules over time is important not only to performance assessment and improvement, but also addresses related issues, such as response to changes in Influencers.

   Copyright, 2010.  The Business Rules Group 45 Rel. 1.4  If a metric is particularly important, it may attain a special status and be called a Key Performance Indicator (KPI) or a Critical Success Factor (CSF) — or something else.  The choice of signifier is unimportant.  The enterprise will decide on many different things to be measured.30   Each of these measurements will have differing degrees of importance relative to the attainment of some Objective or set of Objectives.  The fact that the enterprise has decided to measure, evaluate, and act on the results of the metrics is the important thing.

The formulation of a 29 Business Policy is under an enterprise’s control by a party authorized to manage, control, or 30 regulate the enterprise, by selection from alternatives in response to a combination of 31 Assessments. 32 ‘Not directly enforceable’ means that some interpretation of the Directive (e.g., in Business 33 Rules) is needed in order to detect violations.

The  placeholder definition is given: 7 A Business Process is a set of activities that are performed within an organization or across 8 organizations.  [OMG BPMN] 9 A Business Process ... 10 • is the responsibility of an Organization Unit. 11 • realizes Courses of Action. 12 • is guided by Business Rules. 13 • is governed by Business Policies. 14 • may deliver Offerings. 15 • may manage Assets. 16 A Business Process may contain more than one separate Process.  Each Process may have its 17 own Sub-Processes.  Individual Processes would be independent in terms of sequence flow, 18 but could have message flows connecting them.  19 An activity is work that is performed within a business process.  An activity can be atomic or 20 non-atomic (compound).  The types of activity that are a part of a Business Process are:  21 Process, Sub-Process, and Task.  22 Business Rule 23 is a rule that is under business jurisdiction.  A rule is a proposition that is a claim of 24 obligation or of necessity.32  The common sense understanding of ‘rule’ is that a rule always 25 tends to remove some degree of freedom. 26 A Business Rule is an individual Directive that is practicable — that is, does not require 27 additional interpretation to undertake Strategies or Tactics. 28 ‘Practicable’ means that a person who understands a Directive could observe a relevant 29 situation (including his or her own behavior) and recognize directly whether or not the 30 business was complying with that Directive.   31 For rules that govern activity (SBVR ‘operative business rule’), this recognition is about the 32 behavior of people and what form compliant behavior takes.  For example, “each rental must 33 be guaranteed by a valid credit card held by the renter of the rental.”  For definitional rules 34 (SBVR ‘structural business rule’), this recognition is about evaluation of the criteria vested in 35 the rule to produce consistent outcomes for decisions or calculations.  For example, “a car 36 model requested for a rental must be a car model of the car group specified for the rental.” 37                                                 32 This definition is adopted from the OMG standard “Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules” (SBVR), 2007.  The intent is to keep this definition in sync with SBVR, from which this definition is adopted.

   Copyright, 2010.  The Business Rules Group C-1 Rel. 1.4 Appendix C 1 Diagramming Conventions 2 The graphic representation of the Business Motivation Model is based on three non-normative 3 conventions, as follows.  These conventions have been purposely kept neutral of any particular 4 modeling notations.  The BRG selected conventions that are largely self-explanatory and visually 5 intuitive. 6  Box:  A box of any size represents a core concept.  The name in the box is the preferred term 7 (name) given to that concept.  Refer to the Concepts Catalog for the precise meaning of each 8 term.   9  Box-Within-A-Box:  This indicates categorization — in other words, a box within a box 10 indicates that one concept is a category of the other concept.  Another way to think about this 11 is that the inner box represents a specific kind, type, class, or variation of the outside box.   12 This graphic representation of categories does not imply any constraints; specifically it does 13 not imply that: 14 • The list of categories is mutual exclusive. 15 • The list of categories is exhaustive. 16 • Any category is mandatory.     17 When any of these constraints do apply, that fact is always documented explicitly in the 18 Concepts Catalog.  19  Connection-Between-Boxes:  A line connecting any two boxes (or the same box twice) 20 indicates a logical connection — that is, a fact type — between core concepts. 21 Crucial to any line is its labels.  These labels are written carefully as verbs or verb phrases (in 22 both directions) so that the logical connections of the Model can be read as simple English 23 sentences.  These sentences convey the exact meaning of the connections in the context of 24 the Model; however, more explanation is given in the Concepts Catalog, along with the 25 definitions for each of the terms involved. 26 This graphic representation of logical connections (fact types) does not imply any 27 constraints; specifically it does not imply that:  28 • The logical connection is mandatory for any concept involved. 29 • Any upper or lower limits apply to the logical connection. 30 When any such constraint does apply, that fact is always documented explicitly in the 31 Concepts Catalog.  In the absence of such documented constraint, the connection lines can be 32 taken to represent simple unconstrained fact types (i.e., ‘many-to-many’ and optional in both 33 directions).   34

   Copyright, 2010.  The Business Rules Group C-2 Rel. 1.4 Two special conventions are worth noting.   1 1) When a fact type involves three or more concepts, a simple line cannot be used to represent 2 the fact type.  In this case, the fact type is shown as a concept box, named with a term for the 3 fact type (shown suffixed with *) and having unlabeled lines radiating from the box to the 4 fact type’s participating concepts.  One reading of the fact type is given in a Legend.   5 2) A shaded (orange) box represents a concept that is related to concepts of the Model but this 6 concept, itself, is from a source external to the Model. 7

The Business Rules Group D-1 Rel. 1.4 Appendix D 1 Overview of EU-Rent 2 This Appendix provides an overview of the fictitious car rental company used for examples 3 throughout the specification.  4 EU-Rent is a car rental company that operates in several countries in Western Europe and North 5 America.  In each of its countries of operation, EU-Rent has an operating company that defines a 6 number of local areas in which it locates rental branches and service depots.  7 EU-Rent rents cars to customers, and offers standard models from major manufacturers.  Car 8 models are categorized into groups ranging from ‘economy’ to ‘luxury’, with a different tariff for 9 each group.  10 Rental branches do not own specific cars.  Each local area owns a pool of cars that are available 11 to the rental branches in the area.  Each branch has an allocation (capacity, not actual cars) from 12 the pool, which it uses to meet demand for rental bookings.  If it exhausts its allocation it can 13 request additional capacity, which is provided from a reserve pool on a ‘first come, first served’ 14 basis.  15 Tariffs are set nationally.  The operational rental business is managed mainly at the local area 16 and branch level, with fairly strong national guidance on car purchase and disposal — what 17 models can be purchased, how long to keep them, etc. — and global guidance on customer 18 service and the EU-Rent brand. 19 EU-Rent accepts both rental bookings in advance and walk-in rentals.  Advance bookings are 20 accepted by phone, Internet or in person in branches.  A EU-Rent branch can accept a booking 21 for pick-up at any EU-Rent branch world-wide.  22 EU-Rent is a medium-sized company catering to the general car rental market.  It has two major 23 concerns: 24  It is facing increasing competition from companies offering lower rates, especially in 25 vacation and resort areas. 26  It sees opportunities for expansion as Eastern European countries enter the European 27 Community, and business and trade increase. 28 In response, EU-Rent has decided to: 29  Position itself in the market as a ‘premium’ brand, alongside the bigger players such as Hertz 30 and Avis. 31  Expand into Eastern Europe, focusing on major business centers. 32  Target business renters, in two ways: 33 » As individuals, offering convenient locations, high-quality service (value for 34 money rather than lowest possible price), and an attractive loyalty rewards 35 scheme for frequent renters 36 » As companies, offering corporate agreements in which discounted rental tariffs 37 are offered in return for ‘captive business’ 38 EU-Rent represents itself as environment-friendly and uses electric and LPG cars where suitable 39 models are available.  40

   Copyright, 2010.  The Business Rules Group E-1 Rel. 1.4 Appendix E 1 The Business Motivation Model in the Context of 2 the Zachman Architecture Framework 3 John Zachman has provided a useful context for discussing the architecture of an enterprise.  His 4 ‘Framework for Enterprise Architecture’ is a matrix that describes the various ways the 5 stakeholders of an enterprise view the business and its systems.34   6 The Framework characterizes architecture in terms of the perspectives of the different 7 stakeholders (represented by rows in the matrix) and focuses on the different aspects (or 8 ‘abstractions’) of architecture (represented by the columns).  The rows represent, successively, 9 the Planner, Owner, Designer, Builder, and Subcontractor perspectives.  The columns reflect the 10 abstractions dealing with the aspects of Data, Process, Location, Role, Timing, and Motivation 11 (What, How, Where, Who, When, and Why).   12 The Business Motivation Model addresses the business Owner’s perspective (i.e., Row Two) of 13 the sixth aspect (i.e., the Motivation or ‘Why’ column).35  Indeed, the name of the Model directly 14 reflects this focus on motivation.   15 Also noteworthy is that the positioning of the Model in Row Two means that all references to 16 Business Rules in the Model describe or prescribe elements involved in the structure and 17 operation of the business — not its information systems or its technology.   18 E.1 Relationship to Other Aspects of the Business Model 19 As acknowledged at the beginning of this document and again just above, motivation is just one 20 aspect of a complete business model.  So, while every effort was made to limit the scope of the 21 Model to this single abstraction, selective reference to elements of other abstractions were 22 sometimes necessary — specifically, to concepts of the ‘Who’ and ‘How’ columns.36  23 The ‘Who’ Connections 24 It is difficult to avoid references to ‘Who’ in discussions of ‘Why.’  Generally, it is not adequate 25 to say, “the motivation is that the company wants it that way.”  This leads to the perpetuation of 26                                                 34 John A. Zachman, “A Framework for Information Systems Architecture,” IBM Systems Journal, Vol. 26, No. 3 (1987).   35 The BRG’s 1995 paper addressed the first and sixth aspects (that is, the data and motivation columns) from the Designer’s perspective (that is, Row Three). 36 Three concept areas discussed in this Appendix — Organization Unit, Business Process, and Asset/Liability — are designated as ‘placeholder’ in the OMG BMM Specification.  In this respect, they have roles in the structure of the Business Motivation Model but actually belong in other standards, where they are defined and associated with related concepts needed for detailed business modeling.  The relevant family of OMG standards for these concepts is the OMG’s Organization Structure Metamodel (OSM) for Organization Unit and its Business Process Definition Metamodel (BPDM) for Business Process.  Asset/Liability, discussed in BMM “8.5.3 Asset and Liability,” is not yet referenced to any particular OMG specification.  See BMM “8.5 Placeholders” for the complete discussion of the harmonization of these standards.

   Copyright, 2010.  The Business Rules Group E-2 Rel. 1.4 unnecessary rules — unnecessary either because the business requirement for them has passed, 1 or because they were not Business Rules in the first place (e.g., they were imposed as 2 workarounds in systems that did not fully support business needs).  3 Being able to pin down the motivation more precisely is essential.  After all, if a responsible 4 party cannot be found for a rule, it should probably be challenged.  The Model therefore supports 5 identifying those parties who play key roles with respect to motivation.   6 This capability is reflected in the Model by linking elements of the business plans to specific 7 parts of the organization (i.e., its Organization Units).  This has been done where the connection 8 is important for developing, analyzing, challenging, and maintaining the business plans.   9 These logical connections (i.e., fact types) include the following:   10  Organization Unit is responsible for Assets 11  Organization Unit is responsible for Liabilities 12  Organization Unit defines Ends 13  Organization Unit establishes Means 14  Organization Unit acts as Influencing Organization 15  Organization Unit recognizes Influencers 16  Organization Unit makes Assessments 17  Organization Unit is defined by Strategies 18  Organization Unit is responsible for Business Processes 19

   Copyright, 2010.  The Business Rules Group E-3 Rel. 1.4 Influencing Organization 1 It is useful to be able to connect an Influencer to one or more Influencing Organizations; for 2 example: 3  To connect Regulation Influencers to their originating Regulators 4  To reference some specific competitor companies from a Competitor Influencer 5  To reference a Technology influencer to organizations involved in its development or 6 delivery 7 
 8 Figure E-2.  Influencer and Influencing Organization 9 An Influencing Organization is an organization that is external to the enterprise modeled in a 10 given enterprise Business Motivation Model, and that influences that enterprise. 11 An Influencing Organization is the source of Influencers.  An Influencer may have multiple 12 sources, or none. 13 BMM also supports Organization Category for categorization of Influencing Organizations, but 14 does not provide a default set of categories.  Enterprises can define whatever Organization 15 Categories they need.  Organization Categories may themselves be categorized in broader 16 categories; a narrower category may be included in more than one broader category.  17 An Organization Unit from the same organization as the enterprise modeled in a given Business 18 Motivation Model can act as an Influencing Organization for some Influencers.  An Organization 19 Unit playing this role would normally be outside the boundary of the enterprise modeled in the 20 given Model. 21 For example, a Directive on working conditions from the Human Resources Department may 22 have to be treated as Regulation by an operating department, such as Production.  The Human 23 Resources Department, from the perspective of the Production Department, would be acting like 24 an external regulator.  Similarly, there might be internal sources for other kinds of Influencer, 25 such as Customer, Competitor, Technology. 26 The ‘How’ Connections 27 To expand on the ‘being-doing’ relationships between Ends and Means, the ‘How’ column of the 28 Framework needs to be considered.  ‘How’ is specified as Business Processes.  29 It is widely recognized that Business Processes and Business Rules are closely related.  It is 30 important to be clear on the differences.  31 Business Processes realize Courses of Action — they provide detail of activities, plus 32 sequencing, control, and synchronization that enable the enterprise to undertake its Courses of 33 Action.  Business Rules guide Business Processes — they provide the basis for decisions that 34 need to be made within Business Processes.  35 
The Business Motivation Model Business Governance in a Volatile World  
   Copyright, 2010.  The Business Rules Group E-4 Rel. 1.4 Business Processes, Courses of Action, and Business Rules are all developed to help the 1 enterprise reach its Goals.  They need to be coherent and consistent.  This is feasible if they are 2 governed by a coherent and consistent set of Business Policies. 3 Business Processes are governed by Business Policies, which: 4  Provide guidance (both directly and via Courses of Action) on what Business Processes have 5 to do. 6  Set limits on how Business Processes may undertake what they have to do.  7 
 8 Figure E-3.  Business Process Connections 9 ‘Business Process’ in the Model is a ‘placeholder’ for a concept adopted from the OMG’s 10 Business Process Modeling and Notation (BPMN) specification.    11 Each Business Process is the responsibility of some Organization Unit (the process owner).  12 There are other facts connecting Business Process and Organization Unit; for example, 13 assignment of activities in Business Processes to roles in the organization is the basis of 14 workflow.  However, these connections are again outside the scope of the Model, and are 15 appropriately addressed by some other standard(s).  16 The ‘Asset/Liability’ Connections 17 When Courses of Action are being defined, ‘things’ that are used in operating the enterprise 18 often have to be considered.  They are represented in the Model as Assets, of two kinds: 19  Fixed Assets:  things that are kept long-term, maintained, reused, and, perhaps, eventually 20 replaced.  They can be tangible, such as equipment and buildings, or intangible, such as 21 patents and licenses. 22  Resources:  things that are consumed and replenished, such as raw materials, parts, finished 23 goods, and cash. 24 Two things should be borne in mind.  Firstly, the term ‘Asset’ has an accounting flavor, but it is 25 not used in that sense in the Model.  Most users of the Business Motivation Model will probably 26 have an operational perspective.  They will want to refer to the real things in the business — the 27 actual equipment, buildings, and stocks of materials — and that is what ‘Asset’ means in the 28 Model.  The accounting perspective would be the monetary values, rather than the things 29 themselves.  Also, a Business Motivation Model can include Assets that might not be explicitly 30 valued financially, such as skills of people in the enterprise. 31 
The Business Motivation Model Business Governance in a Volatile World  
   Copyright, 2010.  The Business Rules Group E-5 Rel. 1.4 Secondly, Asset, Resource, and Fixed Asset are placeholders — references to things defined in 1 detail elsewhere in the enterprise, outside its Business Motivation Model.  Only those that are 2 relevant to governance decisions need be included.  There is no requirement for a coherent, 3 complete structure of Assets within a Business Motivation Model; that will be maintained in the 4 system(s) referenced by the Model placeholders. 5 One type of Asset that is often explicitly referenced is the enterprise’s products and services, 6 called ‘Offering’ in the Model.  An Offering is a specification of a product or service — an 7 intangible Fixed Asset.  Instances of it, such as quantities of finished goods, would be a 8 Resource. 9 As well as Assets, enterprises also need to consider Liabilities — again, not in an accounting 10 sense.  A Liability in the Model is a reservation of Resource(s) to meet commitments, such as 11 materials needed to fulfill a contract or cash to pay taxes.   12 These Asset and Liability concepts are illustrated in Figure E-4. 13 
 14 Figure E-4.  Asset and Liability 15 Some Fixed Assets provide Resources in the form of capacity over time; for example: production 16 equipment, storage buildings, skills possessed by people.  The Resources they provide are either 17 consumed or are dissipated as time passes without their being used. 18 Offerings — specifications of products and services — may use intangible Fixed Assets, such as 19 designs, licenses, patents, and brands.  An Offering requires Resources — materials, equipment 20 capacity, people’s time — for production of things that meet the specification. 21 A Liability claims Resources; it reserves resources needed to meet commitments — which 22 means that the resources cannot be used for other purposes. 23 
The Business Motivation Model Business Governance in a Volatile World  
   Copyright, 2010.  The Business Rules Group E-6 Rel. 1.4 Figure E-5 illustrates the connection of Asset and Liability to the rest of the Model. 1 
 2 Figure E-5.  Asset and Liability Connections 3 Courses of Action may: 4  deploy Assets — determine how Assets will be assigned and used in realizing the Courses of 5 Action. 6  define Offerings — the products and services that can be supplied by the enterprise. 7  discharge Liabilities — ensure that commitments are met. 8 A Directive may govern use of Assets, regardless of which Courses of Action deploy them. 9 Other placeholders may be associated with Assets and Liabilities.  Business Processes may: 10  deliver Offerings. 11  manage Assets. 12 An Organization Unit may be responsible for Assets and/or Liabilities. 13 E.2 Additional Aspects of the Business Model 14 The other abstractions of the Framework at Row 2 are significant in a complete business model.  15 For example,  16  The ‘Where’ aspect — a Logistics Model identifying where the business will operate and 17 how those locations are linked together.  Such a model might also prescribe application of 18 Business Rules in different places (including differences that need to be accommodated in 19 globalization of the enterprise).  20   The ‘When’ aspect — an Event Model describing the events in the business cycle and how 21 those events cause changes or activities in the enterprise. 22 In addition, all six abstractions of the Framework have potential interdependencies.  For 23 example, workflow to accomplish the same Ends may be different for different categories of 24 location. 25
