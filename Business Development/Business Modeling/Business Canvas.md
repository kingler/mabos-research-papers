The “Business Model Canvas” has been designed to visualize the essential ingredients of a business model as a future business scenario, on one page. The left part focusses on external components, in order to understand the ways in which you reach and serve your customers and users. The right part comprises internal components to describe how your organisation works to create and deliver high value. The “Business DNA” is the very essence of your business model, which is key to building your initial market offerings in later stages. It is explained in detail on the following page. Think of different scenarios when designing new business models. There are always many ways to create your offerings, to serve your customers and users, and to charge them. Be as clear as possible and avoid nonsensical jargon. Whilst it is so easy just to scratch the surface, try to imagine how your new business model really works.
