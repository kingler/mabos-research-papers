Business Motivation Model, v1.3        11 Scope
1.1 Introduction
The Business Rules Group (BRG) developed the Business Mo tivation Model and published Version 1.0 on the BRG web 
site (www.businessrulesgroup.or g) in November 2000. The latest version of  BRG/BMM, version 1.3, was published in 
September 2007.
The Business Motivation Model provides a scheme or stru cture for developing, communicating, and managing business 
plans in an organized manner. Specifically, the Bu siness Motivation Model does all of the following:
• Identifies factors that motivate the establishing  of business plans. 
• Identifies and defines the el ements of business plans.
• Indicates how all these factor s and elements inter-relate. 
Among these elements are those that provide governance for and guidance to the business — Business Policies and 
Business Rules.
The structure of the BMM provides the basis for logical design of easily-constructed tools for storing, cross-referencing, 
and reporting the elements of business plans for business enterprises. 
1.2 What is the Busin ess Motivation Model?
The Business Motivation Model contains:
• A set of built-in concepts that define the elements of business plans. They ar e associated in a structure that is 
methodology-neutral; it will support a range of approaches  for creating and maintaining a Business Motivation Model 
for an enterprise, and is particularly strong in sup port of processes that are driven by business change. 
• Roles in the structure for three esse ntial concepts: Business Process, Business Rule, and Organization Unit. They 
participate in associations within the Business Motivation Mode l, but also (it is assumed) in other associations outside 
its scope - as is the case in SBVR and BPMN, both adopted OMG specifications. OMG does not have a general 
specification for organization structure. They are regarded as references to  elements that will be defined and 
maintained outside an enterprise’s Business Motivation Model.
The Business Motivation Model is simple. Its concepts have only basic attributes - identifier and text description. Most of 
its associations are unconstraine d: optional and many-to-many. 
Software tools that support the Business Motivation Model us ually provide simple recording and reporting functionality, 
with some analysis capabilities (e.g., reporting of goals that are not quantified by objectives, business rules that are not 
derived from any business policy). 
The Business Motivation Model is not:
• A specification for a business development management process or tool.
• A specification for a project definition or management process or tool.
• A specification for a full business model. 
It could be included in such specifications , but that is beyond the scope of this one.
2              Business Motivation Model, v1.3There are two major areas of the Business Motivation Model:  
1. The first is the Ends and Means of business plans. Among the Ends are things the enterp rise wishes to achieve (for 
example, Goals and Objectives ). Among the Means are things  the enterprise will employ to achieve those Ends (for 
example, Strategies, Tactics, Busi ness Policies, and Business Rules). 
2. The second is the Influencers that sh ape the elements of the business plans, and the Assessments made about the 
impacts of such Influencers on Ends and Means (i.e ., Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats).
The Ends, Means, and Influencers are rela ted to each other in order to answer the following two fundamental questions:
1.What is needed to achieve what the enterprise wishes to achieve?  This question is answered by laying out the 
particular elements of the business plans (in other words, the Means nece ssary to achieve the desired Ends).
2.Why does each element of  the business plan exist?  This question is answered by identifying the particular Ends 
that each of the Means serves, and the Infl uencers that underlie the choices made in  this regard. This is what is meant 
by ‘motivation.’
All elements of the Business Motivation Model are developed fro m a business perspective. The basic idea is to develop a 
business model for the elements of the business plans before  system design or technical development is begun. In this 
manner, the business plans can become the foundation for such activity, connecting system solutions firmly to their 
business intent. 
1.3 Other Elements of a Full Business Model
The Business Motivation Model is not a fu ll business model. For example, the elemen ts of business plans do not prescribe 
in detail any of the following, each of which is  an essential part of a full business model.
• Business Processes: business plans include Courses of Action – what th e enterprise has to do to achieve its Ends – 
transformed into Business Processes that encompass activitie s, sequencing, dependencies, interactions, triggering by 
business events, etc. Business Process specification is outside the scope of business plans. However the Business 
Motivation Model does include a placeholder for Business Pro cess, to provide for integrat ion with emerging Business 
Process standards.
• Workflows:  the basis of workflow is assignment of responsibiliti es for Business Processes to roles in the organization. 
Design of workflow is outside the scope of business plans. However, the business plans may include Strategies or Tactics that configure organization stru cture to achieve effective workflow.
• Business Vocabulary: also needed is full sp ecification of the terms and facts n eeded to support the business.   
However, the business plans do provide a business basis for such development — namely, the concepts and vocabulary used in the elements of the business plans, particularly in its Business Rules.
Refer to Annex D for comments about add itional elements of a full business model.
1.4 Business Rules in the Business Motivation Model
Business Rules play an important role in development of business plans. For example, they can serve the following 
purposes:
• Make business tactics sufficiently well developed to guide the actual performance of work.
• Provide fallback positions when some  element of the business plan fails. 
Business Motivation Model, v1.3        3• Resolve conflicts when the Ends the busine ss seeks are in confli ct with one another.
Because of this key role, which is ofte n make-or-break for the very success of business plans, developing the motivation 
for Business Rules from the business perspective is fundamentally important.
1.5 Methodologies and the Bu siness Motivation Model
It is important to note that the Business Motivation Model is  not in any sense a methodology. Indeed, it is entirely neutral 
with respect to methodology or particular approach, with only several general exceptions as follows:
• The requirements development pro cess should be business-driven.
• Organized business plans should be a fundamental deliverable in any such process.
• Business Rules and Business Processes ar e key elements of such business plans.
One way to think of the Business Motivation Model is as  a blueprint purposely designed to support a range of 
methodological approaches. Implementation of the Model would re sult in the elements of business plans being stored and 
related to other information about the enterprise, no matte r what methodology was used for discovering and defining 
them. 
In the design for any such implementation, each concept of the Business Motivation Model (i.e.,  each concept listed in the 
Concepts Catalog) should be as signed two attributes ‘name’ and ‘description’ to be included in the implementation. User 
enterprises and repository vendors could, of c ourse, choose to include additional attributes.
1.6 Beneficiaries of the Business Motivation Model
Three types of people are expected to benefit from the Bu siness Motivation Model:  Deve lopers of business plans, 
Business modelers, and Im plementers of software tools and repositories. 
1.6.1 Developers of Business Plans
The Business Motivation Model is a conceptu al tool for engineering the business itsel f. It provides developers of business 
plans with:
• A set of concepts that acts as a ch eck-list of factors to be considered
• A standard vocabulary
• A flexible model to support their development processes
They also use tools that implement the Business Motivation Model for storage and management of their business plans. 
1.6.2 Business Modelers
Modelers who develop detailed business models will, in the future, use standards and models based on OMG’s 
specifications such as BPMN and SBVR. 
The Business Motivation Model will support them in two ways:
1. The content of their enterprise’s Busi ness Motivation Model will help to guide and shape their more detailed models.  
4              Business Motivation Model, v1.32. Eventually specifications such as BPMN and SBVR together with the Business Motivation Model (or something with 
similar scope) should be merged into a single business-orie nted modeling architecture, a nd implemented in integrated 
tool suites. Until then, tools based on the Business Motivat ion Model could provide a straightforward way of relating 
business processes, business rules, and or ganization units to each  other, and to the desired results, courses of action, 
and business policies that affect them. 
1.6.3 Implementers of soft ware tools and repositories
The Business Motivation Model provides the basis of a logical data design that has been implemented in the databases of 
tools that support the model. 
Tool developers might also choose:
• To elaborate on the Business Motivation Model, with addition al attributes, more-normalized  entities, and more refined 
associations.
• To use the Business Motivation Model in specifications of tools that support models with broader scope than the Business Motivation Model.
Both of these are beyond the scope of this specification. 
2 Conformance
Software that conforms with the specification will be able  to import and export XMI documents that conform with the 
XMI rules applied to the normative metamodel contained in OMG document dtc/07-08-05.
3 Normative References
The following normative documents contain provisions which, thro ugh reference in this text, constitute provisions of this 
specification. For dated refere nces, subsequent amendments to , or revisions of, any of these publications do not apply. 
• Merriam-Webster Unabridged Dictionary [MWUD]
• Oxford Dictionary of English [ODE]
• Semantics of Business V ocabulary and Business Rules [SBVR] 
4 Terms and Definitions
For the purposes of this specification, the terms and definitions given in the normative reference and the following apply.
enterprise
“a business or company” [Oxford Dictionary of English, definition 2]. An enterprise can be either for-profit or not-for-profit 
— similar concepts apply. Also, the 'enterpr ise' can be some subset of a larger ente rprise; again, similar concepts should appl y.
Business Motivation Model, v1.3        5concept
“unit of knowledge created by a unique combination of characteristics” [SBVR, adopted from ISO 1087-1 (English)]
fact
“proposition that is taken as true” [SBVR]
fact type
“concept that is the meaning of a verb phrase that involves one or more noun concepts and whose instances are all actualities” 
[SBVR]. For example, the fact ty pe “city is in country” involves the noun con cepts “city” and “country”  and some actualities 
are “Paris is in France,” “Geneva is in Switzerland,” “Melbourne is in Austra lia.” In a UML model, a fact type would typically 
be represented as an association. 
necessity
“a modal property that qualifies an asser tion of a whole proposition just when it is  not considered possible that the propositi on 
is false.” [SBVR]
noun concept
“concept that is the meaning of a noun or  noun phrase” [SBVR]. For example, “city,” “country,” “person,” “car ,” Paris, France. 
In a UML model, a noun concept would typicall y be represented as a class or an instance.
verb concept
Synonym for “fact  type” [SBVR]

8              Business Motivation Model, v1.3
Business Motivation Model, v1.3        97 The Business Motivation Model
7.1 Overview
Fundamental to the Business Motivation Model is the notion of ‘motivation.’ If an enterprise prescribes a certain 
approach for its business activity, it ought to be able to say ‘why ;’ that is, what result(s) the approach is meant to achieve.  
Sometimes it is difficult to uncover such motivation, especially  in operations that have been going on for some time. All 
too often it turns out to be “...because we had to find a workaround for a system that didn’t do quite what was needed.” 
This may describe business work prac tice, information systems, or both. 
A cornerstone of any work addressing motivation has to be the enterprise’s aspirations (its Vision) and its action plans for 
how to realize them (its Mission). Refinements were intr oduced; Vision into Goals and Objectives, and Mission into 
Strategies for approaching Goals, and Tactic s for achieving Objectives. The general term End was adopted to refer 
broadly to any of the ‘aspiration’ concepts  (Vision, Goal, Objective) and the term Means  to refer generally to any of the 
‘action plan’ concepts (Mission,  Strategy, Tactic). This conjunction of En ds and Means ‘being’ and ‘doing’ provides the 
core concepts of the Model1.   
An enterprise, however, cannot operate on this Model alone — the business needs to take into account the numerous 
Influencers that can hinder or assist its  operation. These Influencers provide Oppor tunities that would help the enterprise 
operate, as well as Threats that would thwart it. Influencers also represent Strengths from within that the enterprise could 
exploit, or Weaknesses that it should compensate for. 
But is an Influencer inherently a Strength or Weakness — is  it always a Threat or Opportunity? That determination comes 
from an Assessment of the impact of an Influencer on the st ated Ends and Means — an Assessment such as is developed 
in SWOT2 analysis. In this commonly-used technique, Internal In fluencers (assessed to be St rengths and Weaknesses) and 
External Influencers (assessed to be O pportunities and Threats) are analyzed as a part of business plan development.
Once an Assessment has identified relevant Influencers in term s of their impact on Ends and Means, Directives (Business 
Policies and Business Rules) can be put in  place to govern and guide the enterprise Courses of Action. Directives keep the 
enterprise on course and moving toward its  Desired Results. Because of their integr al role in guiding Courses of Action, 
Directives are included in the set of Means concepts.
Business Rules are noteworthy in that regard. Business Rule s sharpen the Business Tactics be cause they make Courses of 
Action concrete at the operational level. Bu siness Rules can also provide specific remedies when a Course of Action fails, 
and specific resolutions to conflicts that inevitably arise amon g the Ends. In short, Business  Rules provide the leverage 
needed for building effective, adaptable business solutions and systems. 
Understanding the motivation for Business  Rules is crucial in that regard. 
• When a Business Rule is encountered, you can ask where it would fit — which Influencer, on which End or Means, 
does it address?  
 
1. In fact, this is the essential distincti on between Ends (the ‘being’ — “what you aspire to be”) a nd Means (the ‘doing’ — “the  
actions you intend to take to get there”). This distinction is expressed in the term s 'Desired Result' a nd 'Course of Action'.
2. Note that SWOT is an example of a we ll-established technique: othe r techniques (and spec ializations of Assessment) may be 
substituted – but they should be adequate re placements for SWOT.
10              Business Motivation Model, v1.3• When a Business Rule does not seem to fi t, it can be challenged. Does it perhap s support some older Means or End that 
is no longer relevant to the enterpris e? Was it a workaround for some histori cal information system deficiency or 
organizational issue that is no longer relevant? 
7.2 Key Ideas in the Bu siness Motivation Model
7.2.1 Business  Perspective
All elements of an enterprise Business Motivation Model are developed from a business perspective. The idea is to 
develop a business model for the elements of the busines s plans before beginning system design or technical 
development, or even detailed busines s modeling. The business plans then become the foundation for such activity, 
connecting system solutions firmly to their business intent.
7.2.2 Motivation
Enterprises do not, or should not, act randomly. When an enterp rise executes a business process or applies a business rule, 
it should be able to say why. 
Business processes realize courses of ac tion. Courses of action are undertaken to  ensure that the enterprise makes 
progress towards one or more of its goals (which might in clude “to stay where we are, relative to our market and 
competitors”). Goals are defined because people in authority in the enterprise:
• assess the effect of some influences on the enterprise,
• decide what the goals should be.
Some of the logic of business processes may be expressed in business rules. Bu siness rules are derived from business 
policies. Business policies are defined beca use people in authority in the enterprise:
• assess the effect of some influences on the enterprise,
• decide what the policies should be.
Since much of the motivation for what an enterprise does is base d on people in the enterprise deciding what is best for it, 
the enterprise should be able to say who decided, a nd on what assessments of what influences. And when. 
In practice, real businesses do not have complete traceability of motivation. But,  as and when they choose to move 
towards it, the Business Motiv ation Model will support it. 
7.2.3 Reaction to Change
A fundamental assumption of the Business Motivation Model is th at what an enterprise does is driven not by change, but 
by how the enterprise decides to react to  change. The recognition of changes caus ed by influencers (or, sometimes, no 
change when change was anticipated) and the assessme nt of their impact on the enterprise is crucial. 
The Business Motivation Model does not require a specific proc ess for reaction to change. Whatever process is used, the 
model supports traceability:
• Forward, from impact of influence to specification of business processes, business rules, and organization 
responsibilities.
• Backward, for an enterprise to demonstrate wh y it does what it does the way it does it.
Both are important for governance, a nd especially for regulatory compliance.
Business Motivation Model, v1.3        117.2.4 Separation of Concerns
Substantial effort went into making the c oncepts in the Business Motivation Model as simple as possible. One effect of 
this is separation of concerns  - the distinctions between:
• Ends and means - what an enterprise wants to be, as o pposed to what it has decided to do. Means can be changed 
without changing the ends; vice versa is, perhaps, not so common.
• Changes caused by influencers and assessment of their im pact. The impact of a given change may be assessed 
differently by different people in the enterprise.
• Assessments, and the decisions based on them as expressed in business policies and ends.
• Courses of action (decisions on how to exploit resources an d capabilities) and business policies (directives that enable 
and constrain courses of action).
• “How” and “How well.” Courses of action define how capabil ities will be used; measures of how well they are used 
are defined within objectives they support. Objectives can be changed without changing courses of action. 
7.2.5 Decomposition
The Business Motivation Model is applicable to any enterprise large enough to need to define and manage business plans. 
This can mean that different organization units in the same enterprise each have their own Business Motivation Models, 
which may include elements refined from corresponding el ements owned by higher-level organization units. 
There are three decomposition (includes/included in) as sociations in the Business Motivation Model, on:
• Desired result
• Course of action: there is also a separate relationship, ‘enabled by’
• Business policy
Keeping these decompositions in step is le ft as a matter for methodology and tools. 
In practice, organization boundaries have usually  been determined by organization structure3. Decomposition of desired 
results, courses of action, and busines s policies have been guided by this. 
7.2.6 Metrics
Measures of performance are defined in an enterprise’s Busi ness Motivation Model as objectives. They may be based on 
risks and potential rewards identified in assessments. 
Key Performance Indicators (KPI) / Critical Success Factor s (CSF) are not especially distinguished in the model; 
enterprises can make the distinction if they choose to.
7.3 Overview of BMM Structure
Figure 7.1 provides an overview of the Business Motivation Model. 
3. There has been some limited experience of decomposition by collaborat ive groups and shared-practic e groups, but most has been  
by organizati on structure. 
12              Business Motivation Model, v1.3Figure 7.1 - BMM Overview
7.3.1 End
Ends are about what an enterprise wants to be. Ends can be about changing what the enterprise is (e.g., developing new 
lines of business, moving into new markets) or about mainta ining its current position relative its market and competition. 
The definition of an end does not say how it will be achieved.
In the Business Motivation Model, Ends are categorized as Vision and Desired Results, and Desired Results as Goals and 
Objectives. 
A Vision is an overall image of what the organization wants to be or become. An enterprise can use the Business 
Motivation Model without defining a Vision explicitly. 
Desired Results - Goals and Obje ctives - are more specific. 
A Goal tends to be longer term, and defined qualitatively rather  than quantitatively. It should be narrow - focused enough 
that Objectives can be defined for it.
An Objective is a step along the way towards a Goal. It must  have an end date, and criteria to determine whether it has 
been reached or not. Objectives provide the basis for measuring whether progress is  being made towards Goals.RecommendedCommon Business Vocabulary that supports the Business Motivation Model and other referenced

Business Motivation Model, v1.3        137.3.2 Means
Means are about what an enterprise has decided to do in order to become what it wants to be. 
A Means is some “device, capability, regime, technique, restri ction, agency, instrument, or method that may be called 
upon, activated, or enforced to achieve Ends.” It does not include either the tasks (bus iness processes and workflow) 
necessary to exploit it, nor responsibility for such tasks.
In the Business Motivation Model, Means are organize d into Mission, Courses of Action, and Directives.
A Mission indicates the ongoing operational activity of the enterp rise. Its definition should be broad enough to cover all 
Strategies and the complete area of operations. An enterpri se can use the Business Motivation Model without defining a 
Mission explicitly. 
7.3.3 Course of Action
Courses of Action are what the enterprise has decided to do. A Course of Action is more than simply a resource, skill, or 
competency that the enterprise can call upon. It is a way of c onfiguring some aspect of the en terprise (things, processes, 
locations, people, time) to channel efforts towards Desired Resu lts - the result of a decision by the enterprise about the 
best way to use its resources, skills, and competencies.
A Course of Action defines what has to be done, not how well it has to be done. Measures of  performance are defined in 
Objectives that are supported by the Courses of Action. 
In the Business Motivation Model, Courses of Action are catego rized as Strategies and Tactics. The model does not make 
a hard distinction between the two. En terprises define their own criteria. 
Strategies tend to be long term and fairly  broad in scope. Each Strategy is imple mented by Tactics, which tend to be 
shorter term and narrower in scope. A Tactic may contri bute to the implementation of more than one Strategy. 
There is a de-facto correspondence between Course of Action an d Desired Results. Generally, Strategies are selected to 
move the enterprise towards its goals, and Tactics to ensure that  it meets its Objectives. But this is not hard-wired into the 
model; enterprises can make the correspondences they need. 
Courses of Action do not n ecessarily have to support Desired Results directly; some are selected to enable other Courses 
of Action.
7.3.4 Directive
In the Business Motivation Model, Directives are categorized as Busi ness Policies and Business Rules. 
In general, Business Policies exist to gove rn; that is, control, guide, and shape th e Strategies and Tactics. They define 
what can be done and what must not be done, and may i ndicate how, or set limits on how, it should be done. 
Compared to a Business Rule, a Business Policy tends to be less formally-structured; it may not be atomic (i.e., not 
focused on a single aspect of governance or guid ance) and may be less formally articulated.
Business policies are not directly practicab le. Practicable Directives ar e Business Rules, and they need to be defined as 
such, and managed for consistency a nd completeness. Business Rules ar e derived from Business Policies.
14              Business Motivation Model, v1.3Apart from its role in the structure, ‘B usiness Rule’ is outside the scope of the Business Motivation Model. Its place in 
the structure provides a “hook” to another model, where ‘Business Rule’ is define d and associated with other concepts. 
This is discussed further in “Externally-refe renced Business Model Elements,” below. 
7.3.5 Influencers
An Influencer is something that can cause changes that affect the enterprise in its employment of its Means or 
achievement of its Ends. Alternatively, it might confirm that there are no changes where changes might have been 
expected. 
Influencers may be Internal (from within the enterprise) or  External (from outside the enterprise boundary). If the 
enterprise being modeled is an Organization Unit within a larger organization, it may choose to treat the larger 
organization as an External Influencer. 
The Business Motivation Model provides an example set of categor ies of Influencer. In practice, enterprises define their 
own set.
7.3.6 Assessments
An influence (a change caused by an Infl uencer) is neutral. It is more or less  simply just ‘there’ until the enterprise 
decides how to react to it. An Assessme nt is a judgment about the influence on the enterprise’s ability to employ its 
Means or achieve its Ends. The decisions are reflected in changes to the Ends and/or Means.
Different people might make different Assessments of a given influence on the same Ends and Means, perhaps even the 
same people at different points in time. The model supports a record of which people made  which Assessments and when, 
providing an audit trail for future reference.
The Business Motivation Model suggests SWOT (Strength, Wea kness, Opportunity, Threat) as an example of an approach 
for making assessments. In pr actice, enterprises can substitute different approaches.
The model also includes Potential Impacts that can be id entified to support Assessments. Potential Impacts are 
categorized as Risk and Potential Reward. 
As well as more general associations be tween Assessment, Ends and Means, there is a direct association “Directive is 
motivated by Potential Impact.” This is one of the minor enha ncements in version 1.1 of th e Business Motivation Model, 
based on experience of using th e model in risk management. 
7.3.7 Externally-referenced Business Model Elements
Three concepts: Organization Unit, Business  Process, and Business Rule have ro les in the structure of the Business 
Motivation Model but actually belong in other standards wher e they are defined and associated with related concepts 
needed for detailed business modeling. 
The BRG anticipated that the best sources for the required external standards would be OMG specifications, such as 
Business Process Model and Notation (BPM N), Semantics of Business V ocabulary and Business Rules (SBVR), and the 
organization structure models us ed by BMM user enterprises.
7.3.8 Organization Unit
Organization Unit has two roles:
1. It is a concept in the Business Motivation Model, participating in the following associations:
Business Motivation Model, v1.3        15• defines Ends, 
• establishes Means,
• makes Assessments,
• recognizes Influencers,• may be defined by a Strategy, and
• may be responsible for Business Processes. 
The BPMN concept ‘performer,’ which can be a specific individual, a group, an organization role or position, or an 
organization, is the BMM concept of an organization unit in the roles of being responsible for activities in an  
organization.
2. It is usually the basis for defining the boundaries of the enterprise being modeled. The decomposition of Business 
Policies, Courses of Action, and Desired Results and assign ment of responsibilities within the enterprise is often 
guided by (or, at least, consistent with) the definition of units within the organization structure. 
One way in which the model supports this is that a Direc tive (a Business Policy or Business Rule) at one level can 
act in the role of a Regulation for un its lower down the organization structure.
7.3.9 Business Process
Business Processes realize Courses of Ac tion. They provide processing steps, se quences (including cycles, branches, and 
synchronization), structure (decomposition a nd reuse), interactions, and connection to  events that trigger the processes. 
Courses of Action are governed by Business Policies; Busine ss Processes are also governed by Business Policies.
 ‘Business Process’ participates  in the following associations: 
• realizes Courses of Action,
• is governed by Business Policies,
• may be guided by Business Rules,
• is the responsibility of one or more Organization Units.
‘Business Process’ is a draft definition, taken from the August 2004 draft of BDPM and anticipating a definition to be 
adopted from BDPM when it is further developed.
7.3.10 Business Rule
Business Rules provide specific, practicable guidance to imp lement Business Policies. So me Business Rules could be 
automated in software; some are practicable only by people.
• ‘Business Rule’ participates in  the following associations: 
• is derived from Business Policy,
• may guide Business Processes,
• may have an enforcement level effected by a Tactic.
Note – ‘Business Rule’ is adopted from SBVR. 
16              Business Motivation Model, v1.37.3.11 Associations between Externally-referenced Concepts
The Business Motivation Model includes as sociations between externally-referen ced concepts: ‘Organization Unit is 
responsible for Business Proc ess’ and ‘Business Process is  guided by Business Rule.’ 
These are loosely defined. It is recognized, for example, that  there can be several kinds of  responsibility for a business 
process (e.g., definition, execution, compliance). In practic e, categories of responsibility can be defined as needed.
However, when the OMG specifications for BPMN, SBVR, a nd OSM are eventually integrated, they will, presumably, 
contain specific associations between Business Process, Busi ness Rule, and Organization Un it. In that case, the loose 
associations in the Business Motivation Model might not be  needed, except perhaps as a short-term measure when an 
enterprise Business Motivation Model is being developed.
7.3.12 Common Business Vocabulary
In practice, it is helpful if an enterprise uses a comm on vocabulary for its Business Motivation Model, its business 
processes and business rules, and its allo cation of responsibilities. However, this is  not essential for use of the Business 
Motivation Model, and is outside the scope of this specification.
7.4 Processes Supported by the Business Motivation Model
The Business Motivation Model is neutral with respect to met hodology. One way to think of it is as a blueprint that will 
support a range of methodological approaches. Implementation of  the model would result in a repository in which the 
elements of business plans could be stored, connected, and related to other information about the enterprise, no matter 
what methodology was used for discovering and defining them.
There are some general assumptions:
• Creation and population of an enterprise’s Business Motivation Model should be business-driven.
• Organized business plans should be a fundamental deliverable.
• Business rules, business processes, and or ganizational responsibilities are needed to  realize the plans, and it is valuable 
to trace them back to the rele vant elements of the plans.
One example of a methodological approach is an implied progr ession through the model for an enterprise, illustrated 
below. The boxes represent ongoing activities, and the arrows indicate logical dependencies. An arrow drawn from ‘A’ to 
‘B’ means: “If you are doing ‘B,’ you also need to be doing ‘A’.” How the activities are undertaken will vary from 
methodology to methodology. 
This progression forms the basis of an end-to-end process for dealing with ch ange, from recognition of influence to 
implemented response. 
The progression can be fully traced in the Assessments, Ends, and Means stored in the Business Motivation Model for the 
enterprise, and the connections to Busine ss Processes, Business Ru les, and Organization Responsibilities stored in the 
related business models for the enterprise . The traceability is reversible, so that an enterprise can show why it has the 
processes and rules it has. 
These capabilities are important for governance , and essential for Regulatory Compliance.
Business Motivation Model, v1.3        17Figure 7.2 - Logical progression thro ugh the Business Motivation Model
This implied progression would support processes for three typi cal business scenarios for using the Business Motivation 
Model:
• “Stay where we are” - the enterprise react s to change in its environment, e.g., Regulation and Competition, (rather than 
seeking to change its business) and undertakes defensive activity  to maintain its current position relative to its market 
and competitors. 
• Expand/Diversify - the enterprise retains its business model substantially unchanged, and adds Ends and Courses of 
Action to introduce new products/services and/or operate in new territories.
• New business - the enterprise will need a ‘starter’ model. Industry reference models (e.g., eTOM, for the 
telecommunications industry, from the Telemanagement Forum) may provide a good basis.

20              Business Motivation Model, v1.3
Business Motivation Model, v1.3        218 The Core Elements of the Business Motivation Model
8.1 General
The main elements of the business plans are its Ends and Me ans. These fundamental terms represent two hierarchies, as 
shown in Figure 8.1 and Figure 8.5. 
8.2 The End Concepts
An End is something the business seeks to accomplish. The impor tant thing to remember about an End is that it does not 
include any indication of how it will be achieved. 
In describing Ends, it is useful to document who defined  the End and at what point in time, so that an audit trail exists for 
future reference. This, of cour se, cannot always be mandated.
8.2.1 Categories of End
End concepts can be arranged in a hierarchy, as shown in Figure 8.1.
Figure 8.1 - Hierarchy of “End” Concepts
An End may be either a Vision or some Desired Result (a Goal  or an Objective). The essence is that these are kinds of 
things, in varying detail, that the enterprise is trying to accomplish. 
Vision is an overall image of what the organization wants to be or become. It usually encompasses the entire organization 
and is long-term in its perspe ctive. Desired Results, on the other hand, are th e more specific Goals and Objectives that the 
enterprise, or some part of it, intends to achieve.
8.2.2 Vision
A Vision describes the future state of the enterpri se, without regard to how it is to be achieved. 

22              Business Motivation Model, v1.3A Vision is the ultimate, possibly unattainab le, state the enterprise would like to achieve. A Vision is often compound, 
rather than focused toward one particular aspect of the bu siness problem. A Goal, in contrast, should generally be 
attainable and should be more specifically orient ed to a single aspect of the business problem. 
A Vision is supported or made operative  by Missions. It is amplified by  Goals.
Figure 8.2 - Vision
Examples of Vision include the following: 
8.2.3 Desired Result
A Desired Result is an End that is a state or target that th e enterprise intends to maintain or sustain. A Desired Result is 
supported by  Courses of Action.
8.2.3.1 Categories of Desired Result
Desired Result includes the following concepts:
• Goal
• ObjectiveTable 8.1 - Examples of Vision
Enterprise Vision
EU-Rent (pronounced 
“you rent”)Be the car rental brand of ch oice for business users in the countries in which we operate. 
Pizza Company Be the city’s favorite pizza place.
Consulting Company Be the premier consulting company in the industry.Retail Pharmacy Be the low-co st health care provider with  the best customer service.
Municipal Police 
DepartmentBe a professional, trusted provid er of police services; a leader in cooperative ef forts with the 
neighborhood and other agencies to make our city safer. 

Business Motivation Model, v1.3        23Figure 8.3 - Desired Results — Goals and Objectives
Compared to an Objective, a Goal tends to be longer te rm, qualitative (rather than quantitative), general (rather than 
specific), and ongoing. Compared to a Goal, an Objective te nds to be short term, quantitative (rather than qualitative), 
specific (rather than general), and not continuing  beyond its time frame (which may be cyclical). 
Objectives differ from Goals in that Objectives should always  be time-targeted and measurable . Goals, in contrast, are not 
specific in these ways.   
Desired Results are supported by  Courses of Action, which can be either St rategies or Tactics. Generally, Goals are 
supported by Strategies, and Obje ctives are achieved by Tactics1. 
In many enterprises there is a continuum from major Strategi es that impact the whole of the business to minor Tactics 
with limited, local effects. The dividing line between ‘minor Strategy’ and ‘major Tactic’ is blurred. Also, over time, 
some Courses of Action may evolve from Tactic to Strategy, and some Strategi es may devolve into Tactics. Some 
enterprises do make a hard distinction between Strategies and Ta ctics; these enterprises may ch oose to pair Strategies only 
with Goals, and Tactics only with Objectives. 
Other enterprises use other bases for distinguishing Strategies  and Tactics. For example, some enterprises distinguish 
between Strategy and Tactic based on planni ng horizon. In this case, Strategies are put into place to support the long-term 
Goals (i.e., a planning horizon that is typically several years or more) while Tactics are the Courses of Action 
implemented to deal with the shorter planning horizon of a year or less (the current operational plans). Still other 
enterprises distinguish Strategy (a Course of Action that is for “the gaining of a specific advantage”) from Tactic, which 
is a Course of Action that is for “the deployment of specific resources to gain that advantage.”
As well as the built-in categories of Desired Result - Goal  and Objective - the Model also supports Desired Result 
Category for stakeholder-defined categorization.
A Desired Result may be in more than one Desired Result Ca tegory, and Desired Result Categories may themselves be 
categorized in broader categories; a more specific cate gory may be included in more than one broader category.
1. An enterprise that prefers to strictly maintain this pairi ng can do so by specifying an approp riate constraint. It may also w ant to 
specialize the Model for its own use by re placing the fact type ‘Desired Result  is supported by Course of Action’ with two more 
specific fact types: ‘Goal  is supported by Strategy;’ ‘Objective  is achieved by Tactic.’

24              Business Motivation Model, v1.3The Model does not provide a default set of stakeholder-defi ned categories. Enterprises can define whatever Desired 
Result Categories they need, such as ‘quality,’ ‘service leve ls’ ‘cost/benefit,’ ‘regulatory compliance,’ and might further 
categorize some as key performance indicators.
8.2.4 Goal
A Goal is a statement about a state or condition of the enterp rise to be brought about or sustained through appropriate 
Means. A Goal amplifies  a Vision; that is, it indicates what must be satisfi ed on a continuing basis to effectively attain the 
Vision. 
A Goal should be narrow - focused enough that it can be quantified by  Objectives. A Vision, in contrast, is too broad or 
grand for it to be specifically measured directly by Objectives . However, determining whether a statement is a Vision or 
a Goal is often impossible without in-depth knowledge of  the context and intent of the business planners.
8.2.5 Objective
An Objective is a statement of an attain able, time-targeted, and measur able target that the enterprise seeks to meet in 
order to achieve its Goals. 
• Attainable  - It is self-evident that Objectives  should be attainable. If they are no t, the business plans are unrealistic and 
will likely fail.
• Time-targeted  - All Objectives should be time-targeted. This m eans that either an absolute time frame (e.g., “by 
January 1, 2007”) or relative time frame (e.g., “within tw o years”) should be included in each Objective. This time 
frame indicates when the Ob jective is to be met. 
• Measurable  - Objectives should be measurable. This means they must include some explicit criteria for determining 
whether the Objective is being met in pr actice. This criteria may be fairly exac ting (for example, “on-time 95% of the 
time”). At the very minimum, the criteria must provide a basi s for making a “yes or no” determination (e.g., “up and 
running”). Such criteria may be the ba sis for certain Business Rules, created specifically to comp ute or derive the 
relevant evaluation.
This understanding of ‘Objective’ is consistent with the industry’s popular “SMART” criteria that an Objective be: 
Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-Based.  Table 8.2 - Examples of Goal
Enterprise Goal
EU-Rent To be a ‘premium brand’ car rental company, positioned al ongside companies such as Hertz 
and Avis.
EU-Rent To provide industry-leading customer service.EU-Rent To provide we ll-maintained cars.
EU-Rent To have vehicles available for rent al when and where cu stomers expect them.
Pizza Company To deliver pizzas in an expedient amount of time
.
Consulting Company To improve customer sa tisfaction (over the next five years).
Publishing Company To improve customer sa tisfaction (over the next five years).
e-Business Company To have more cu stomers than any other e-business.
Business Motivation Model, v1.3        25Statements of Objective should always begin with the time- targeted phrase, followed by a quantified noun. Example time-
targeted phrases:
• By 09/01/2001
• Effective immediately
• After 2 years
• Within 5 weeks
• On or before June 1, 2007
• On April 15, 2007
An Objective quantifies  a Goal; that is, it provides the basis for meas ures to determine whether the Goal is being 
achieved. Conversely, the Goal  is quantified  by these measurable Objectives. For example, the Goal “To provide industry-
leading customer service” is quantified by the Objective “E ffective immediately, a ranking of 8 or better on a monthly 
customer satisfaction scale of 1-10” and by the Objective “B y Jan. 1, 2007, a B+ grade level on the annual Better 
Business Bureau ratings.”  
8.2.6 Facts that Organize Ends
Besides those mentioned above, other logica l connections (i.e., fact types) are requ ired to fully organize the Ends. These 
logical connections provide additional struct ure among elements of the Ends themselves. 
8.2.6.1 Interrelating Desired Results
One Desired Result can include other Desired Results; a Desired Result can be included in some other Desired Result. In 
other words, there can be a ‘parts expl osion’ of Desired Results. This connection should be used only to associate like 
instances; that is, Goals only to other Goals and Objectives only to other Objectives.Table 8.3 - Examples of Objective
Enterprise Objective
EU-Rent By end of current year, be rated by A C Ni elson in the top 6 car rental companies in each 
operating country within the European Community. 
EU-Rent By end of current year, be rated by A C Nielse n in the top 9 car rental companies in all other 
operating countries.
EU-Rent By end of current year, to score 85% on EU-Rent’s quarterly custom er satisfaction survey.
EU-Rent During 4th quarter of curren t year, no more than 1% of rentals need the car to be replaced 
because of mechanical break down (excluding accidents). 
Pizza Company By January 1, 2007, 95% on-time pizza delivery.Consulting Company By June 30, 2008, an operational customer call center.e-Business Company Within six months, 10% increase in product sales.
26              Business Motivation Model, v1.3Figure 8.4 - Interrela ting Desired Results
A ‘parts explosion’ of Desired Results happens when there is a decomposition of some higher-level Goal (or Objective) 
into lower-level Goals (or Objectives). Such decomposition occurs, for example, when elem ents of the business plans 
created by one level of management ar e handed down to a lower organizational level for more detailed planning or 
implementation. This creates a ‘recursion’  among the elements, from higher level to lower level. For example, the Goal 
“To keep customers satisfied” includes the sub-Goal “To deliver pizzas in an expedient amount of time” and the sub-Goal 
“To produce tasty pizzas.” 
8.3 The Means Concepts
A Means represents any device , capability, regime, technique, restriction, agency, instrument, or method that may be 
called upon, activated, or enforced to achieve Ends. Remember  that a Means does not indicate either the steps (business 
processes and workflow) necessary to expl oit it, nor responsibility for such tasks, but rather only the capabilities that can 
be exploited to achieve the desired Ends. 
In describing Means, it is useful to document who established  the Means and at what point in time, so that an audit trail 
exists for future reference. This practic e, of course, cannot always be mandated.
8.3.1 Categories of Means
Means concepts can be arranged in a hierarchy, as shown in Figure 8.5.

Business Motivation Model, v1.3        27Figure 8.5 - The Hierarchy of 'Means' Concepts
A Means may be either a Mission, a Course of Action (a Strate gy or Tactic), or a Directive (Business Policy or Business 
Rule).
Mission, like its counterpart Vision, i ndicates a correspondingly long-term approach  — one that is focused on achieving 
the Vision. Like Vision, Mission is not ve ry specific; it is something broadly stated , in terms of the overall functioning of 
the enterprise.
Apart from the basic Mission of the enterprise, the Means of the Business Motivation Model have been carefully 
organized into Courses of Action and Directives.
In some respects, Courses of Action are th e more basic of the two. In and of them selves, however, Courses of Action tend 
to be rather blunt instruments. They require Di rectives to have any real chance of success.
In contrast to Courses of Action, Directives cannot really st and on their own. They exist to give the Courses of Action a 
fine edge. In other words, to ensure that the Courses of Ac tion will be applied intelligently and within the boundaries of 
what is acceptable or optimal for the enterprise. In short, Directives represent encoded (i.e., written down) knowledge that 
ensures the highest possible chances of  success for the Courses of Action.
A Directive always has to do with governan ce or guidance. A Course of Action, in  contrast, identifies an active approach 
in moving toward the Ends. A Course of Action is always action-dominated (action-oriented).
8.3.2 Mission
A Mission indicates the ongoing operational activity of the ente rprise. The Mission describes what the business is or will 
be doing on a day-to-day basis.
A Mission makes  a Vision operative ; that is, it indicates the ongoing activity that makes the Vision a reality. A Mission is 
planned by means  of Strategies. 

28              Business Motivation Model, v1.3Figure 8.6 - Mission
A Mission statement should consist of the following three items  only and should be formed using brief statements of 
them.
1. An action part (for example, “provide”)2. A product or service part  (for example, “pizzas”)
3. A market or customer part (f or example, “customers city-wide”)
The Mission statement should be focused on day-to-day opera tions, generic enough to cover all Strategies, and broad 
enough to cover the comple te area of operations.
Examples of Mission are shown in the following table: 
8.3.3 Course of Action
A Course of Action is an approach or pl an for configuring some aspect of the enterprise involving things, processes, 
locations, people, timing, or motivation undertaken to achiev e Desired Results. In other words, a Course of Action 
channels efforts towards  Desired Results. To help ensure suc cess in this regard, Courses of Action are governed by  
Directives.Table 8.4 - Examples of Mission
Enterprise Objective
EU-Rent Provide car rental service across Europe and North America for both business and personal 
customers.
Pizza Company Provide pizza to customers city-wide.
Consulting Company Provide consulting, outsourcing, and staff augmentation services to companies in North 
America.
Retail Pharmacy Provide generic and et hical drugs to the retail market.

Business Motivation Model, v1.3        29Courses of Action, which include Strategies  and Tactics, represent the basic elements of a general plan or overall solution; 
in other words, an overall approach that the enterprise will ta ke to achieve its Desired Results . It is important to remember 
that Courses of Action are not Business Pr ocesses; rather, Courses of Action can be realized  by Business Processes; that 
is, made operative by Business Processes.
8.3.3.1 Categories of Course of Action
Course of Action includes the following concepts:
• Strategy
• Tactic
Figure 8.7 - Courses of Action
Compared to Tactics, Strategies tend to be longer term and broader in scope. A Strategy  is implemented by  Tactics. 
Strategies usually channel efforts towards  Goals, rather than Objectives.
Compared to a Strategy, a Tactic tends to be shorter term and narrower in scope. Tactics implement  Strategies; they are 
courses of action that will support t hose Strategies. Tactics generally channel efforts towards  Objectives, rather than 
Goals. 
Determining whether a Course of Action is a Strategy or a Ta ctic may be impossible without in-depth knowledge of the 
context and intent of the business planners. In fact, in the course of developing and analyzing business plans, some 
elements may change category as the targ et problem is understood better. For exampl e, an element originally defined as a 
Tactic subsequently may be elevated to a Strategy. The reverse is also likely to occur. In other words, the business plans will gradually evolve toward greater accuracy in specif ication, as well as greater coherence and completeness. 
8.3.4 Strategy
A Strategy is one component of  the plan for the Mission. A Strategy represen ts the essential Course of Action to achieve 
Ends (Goals in particular). A Strategy usually channels efforts towards  those Goals.
A Strategy is more than simply a resource, skill, or competen cy that the enterprise can ca ll upon; rather, a Strategy is 
accepted by the enterprise as the right approach to achi eve its Goals, given the environmental constraints and risks.

30              Business Motivation Model, v1.3Examples of Strategy are shown in the following table:
8.3.5 Tactic
A Tactic is a Course of Action that represents  part of the detailing of Strategies. A Tactic implements  Strategies. For 
example, the Tactic “Call first-time customers persona lly” implements the Strategy “Increase repeat business.”
Tactics generally channel efforts towards  Objectives. For example, the Tactic “Ship products for free” channels efforts 
towards the Objective “Within six mont hs, 10% increase in product sales.” 
Examples of Tactic are shown in the following table:Table 8.5 - Examples of Strategy

to-head, on-airport, with othe r premium car rental companies.

• What models may be bought from which manufacturers;

• Phasing of purchasing and delivery.

EU-Rent Equalize use of cars across rentals so that m ileage is similar for cars of the same car group and 
age.
EU-Rent Comply with car manuf acturers’ maintenance schedules
Pizza Company Hire drivers with thei r own vehicles to deliver pizzas
Business Motivation Model, v1.3        318.3.6 Directive
As the name suggests, Directives indicate how the Courses of Action should, or shoul d not, be carried out (in other words, 
they govern  Courses of Action). Specifically, a Directive defines or constrains or liberates some aspect of an enterprise. It 
is intended to assert business structure or to control or influe nce the behavior of the business, and is stated in declarative 
form.
Figure 8.8 - Interrelating Directi ves with Courses of Action and Ends
Directives govern  Courses of Action. For example, the Business Rule “Pizzas may not be delivered beyond a radius of 30 
miles” governs the Strategy “Deliver pizzas to the location of the customer’s choice.” This governance applies to Tactics 
as well. For example, the Tactic “Encourage rental extensi ons” is governed by the Business Policy “Allow extension of 
rentals by phone.” 
It is expected that al l Courses of Action should be governed by  some Directive, especially as the business plans evolve 
and become more coherent and co mplete. Any Course of Action not governed by  a Directive should be examined 
carefully to discover potential omissions. 
On the other hand, having too many Directives may become un duly constraining. The correct balance in this regard can 
be identified only by having in-depth knowledge of the context and intent of the business people participating in the 
planning. 
In striking this balance it should be remembered that, unless a Directive is made explicit, it is assumed that no constraint 
on other elements of the business plans will be exercised. ‘Uns tated’ Directives simply cannot be addressed in the Model; 
quite literally, they can be recognized only by stating them2. To be taken into account within the Model, every Directive 
must be explicit and recorded in an official manner3.    Consulting Company Provide each member of the sales force with a palmtop
Consulting Company Call first-time customers personally e-Business Company Ship products for freeTable 8.6 - Examples of Tactic
Enterprise Tactic

32              Business Motivation Model, v1.3It is also possible for the Courses of Action to be formulated based on  Directives. For example, the Tactics ‘Comply with 
manufacturer’s maintenance schedules’ and ‘Equalize use of cars across rentals so that mileage is similar for cars of the 
same car group and age’ are both formulated based on the Bu siness Policy ‘Depreciation of cars must be minimized.’ The 
Directive thereby serves as the source of the Course of Action. 
Occasionally a Directive is defined to support the achievement of  a Desired Result directly. For example:
• The Business Policy “The cell phone numbers of customer re presentatives should be available to customers” supports 
achieving the Goal “To provide high-quality customer support.” 
• The Objective “Within six months, 10% increase in product sales” is supported by this Business Rule that defines product sales: “Product sales must be computed as total sale s, minus all of the following: sales tax, shipping charges, 
and maintenance contract fees.”
8.3.7 Business Rule Enforcement Level
A Business Rule that guides behavior4 has an enforcement level. Enforcement leve ls represent alternatives in a graded or 
ordered scale, each of which i ndicates the severity of action imposed to put or keep a rule in force. An example of a range 
of enforcement levels, from ‘strictly enforced’ to ‘guideline’5 is shown in the following table: 
2. For Business Policies in particular, th is represents a de facto b oundary between Model and met hodology. To be workable, a  
practical methodology must address the reality of  implicit Business Polic ies within the business.
3. Making Business Rules exp licit is a fundamental principle of the Business Rule appr oach. Refer to the Business Rule Manifesto  
[BRMAN].
4. Only business rules that guide behavior  (SBVR ‘operative business ru le’) require enforcement. De finitional business rules (SB VR 
‘structural business rule’) are “true by definition”.Table 8.7 - Enforcement levels
Value Meaning
strictly enforced If the rule is violated, the penalty is always applied.deferred enforcement Strictly enforced, but enfo rcement may be delayed (e.g., waiting for resource 
with required skills).
pre-authorized override Enforced, but exceptions allowe d, with prior approval for actors with before-
the-fact override authorization.
post-justified override If not approved after the fact, you may be subject to sanction or other 
consequences.

guideline Suggested, but not enforced.
5. From the OMG specification for “Semantics of Business V ocabulary and Business Rules” [SBVR]
Business Motivation Model, v1.3        33Examples of Enforcement Level include the following:
Deciding what enforcement level is to be applied to a Business Rule is often a Tactic within business plans. In the BMM, 
Tactic effects enforcement level of  Business Rule.
Figure 8.9 - Setting Enforcement Level
8.3.8 Directive as Regulation
A Directive may act as  some other Organization Unit’s Regulation. The Bu siness Rules and Business Policies determined 
at one level in an organization may be effectively the ‘law’ (Regulation) for lower-level organizations. Table 8.8 - Examples of enforcement level
Enterprise Directive Enforcement Level
EU-Rent A EU-Rent agent who is found, after a managerial review, to 
have rented a vehicle to a customer without a valid driver’s license, is to be fired.strictly enforced
Pizza Company A driver who is c onvicted of one moving traffic violation 
while driving for the company will be counseled by a manager concerning safe driving.pre-authorized override
e-Business Company A customer rated negative by more than ten other customers 
will be blocked forever from doing business.override with explanation

34              Business Motivation Model, v1.3Figure 8.10 - Directive as Regulation 
For example, production and sales divisions both have to comp ly with company policy on safety at work. These units in 
turn have to determine their own local policies and rules for their particular compliance with the ‘law’ (company policy) 
imposed from above. Furthermore, the rules and policies they co me up with will most likely be unique; rules for safety 
within the production division are different from those in sales. 
8.3.9 Categories of Directive
Directive includes the following concepts:
• Business Policy
• Business Rule
Compared to a Business Rule, a Busine ss Policy tends to be less structured6, less discrete, and usually not atomic; that is, 
not focused on a single aspect of governance or guidance. Also  compared to a Business Rule , a Business Policy tends to 
be less compliant with sta ndard business vocabulary, a nd less formally articulated7. 
In contrast to a Business Policy, a Busi ness Rule is highly structured and is car efully expressed in terms of standard 
vocabulary. A Business Rule should be di screte and atomic; that is, represent on ly a single aspect of governance or 
guidance. 
Business Policies provide broader governan ce or guidance that is not directly practicable . Business Rules provide 
specific, practicable  governance or guidance to implement Business Policies. ‘Practicable’ means that a person who 
understands a Business Rule coul d observe a relevant situation (including hi s or her own behavior) and decide directly 
whether or not the business wa s complying with the rule.
Some Business Rules could be automated in software; some are practicable only  by people. Business Policies are not 
directly automatable.
6. This means ‘structured’ in a natural language sense, not ‘structured’ in any technical sense.
7. ‘Less formally’ should not be interpreted as ‘less carefully.’

Business Motivation Model, v1.3        358.3.10 Business Policy
A Business Policy is a Directive that is not directly enforceable8 whose purpose is to govern or guide the enterprise. 
Business Policies provide the  basis for  Business Rules. Business Policies also govern  Business Processes.
The formulation of a Business Policy, which is always under the enterprise’s control, is by some party who is authorized 
to manage, control, or regulate the ente rprise by selecting from a variety of alte rnatives in response to one or more 
Assessments. 
Business Policies that exist merely to en able a Strategy in a direct and trivial ma nner should be avoided. For example, 
suppose the enterprise has the Strategy “Enc ourage repeat business.” A Business Polic y that says “Repeat business should 
be encouraged” is trivial and doe s not need to be expressed. 
In general Business Policies exist to govern ; that is, control, guide, and shape the Strategies and Tactics. For example, the 
Business Policy “We will not make on-site visits” governs th e Strategy “Encourage repeat  business,” as well as the 
specific Tactics that might be selected to implement the Stra tegy. Specifically, no Tactic re quiring on-site visits will be 
permitted to support the Strategy; even though on-site visits woul d probably be effective in that regard. On the other hand, 
a Tactic involving sending coupons by mail w ould be acceptable under the Business Policy since it involves no on-site 
visits. 
Examples of Business Policy are shown in the following table:
8. “Not directly enforceable” means that some interpretation of the directive (e.g., in business ru les) is needed in order to de tect  
 violations.Table 8.9 - Examples of Business Policy
Source Business Policy
EU-Rent Depreciation of rental cars must be minimized. 
Compare the (non-practicable) Business Policy with related (practic able) Business Rules:
• The Car assigned to a Rental must be: at the time of assignment, of the available Cars in 
the requested Car Group, the one with the lowest mileage .
• A Rental cannot be extended by phone if the Car’ s odometer reading is greater than (next 
service mileage – 500) . 
EU-Rent Rental payments must be guaranteed in advance.
Compare with Business Rule based on this policy:
• A provisional charge for the estimated cost of the Rental must be made against a valid 
credit card held by the Renter before the Car is handed over.
EU-Rent Rental cars must not be exported.
Compare with Business Rule based on this policy:
• An ‘out of country’ car can be rented only on a one-way rental with drop-off at a branch 
in its country of registration.
EU-Rent Rental contracts are made under the law of the country in which the pick-up branch is 
located.
36              Business Motivation Model, v1.38.3.11 Business Rule
A Business Rule is a Directiv e, intended to govern, guide, or influence busine ss behavior, in support of Business Policy 
that has been formulated in response to an Opportunity, Threat , Strength, or Weakness. It is a single Directive that does 
not require additional interpretation to undertake St rategies or Tactics. Of ten, a Business Rule is derived from  Business 
Policy. Business Rules guide  Business Processes.
Formally, a Business Rule is a rule  that is under business jurisdiction9. A rule always introduces an obligation or 
necessity. 
8.3.12 Facts that  Organize Means
Besides those mentioned above, other logical connections (i.e., fact types) are requ ired to fully organize the Means. These 
logical connections provide additional struct ure among elements of the Means themselves.EU-Rent Rentals must comply with relevant laws and regulations of all countries to be visited.

Business Motivation Model, v1.3        37Figure 8.11 - Facts involving Means
8.3.12.1 Interrelating Courses of Action — Composition
One Course of Action can include  other Courses of Action; a Course of Action can be included in other Courses of 
Action. In other words, there can be a ‘p arts explosion’ of Courses of Action. Th is connection should be used only to 
associate like instances; that is, Strategies only to ot her Strategies and Tactics only to other Tactics. 
Such ‘parts explosion’ happens when th ere is a decomposition of some higher-lev el Course of Action into lower-level 
Courses of Action. This decomp osition occurs, for example, when elements of the business plans created by one level of 
management are handed down to a lower organizational level fo r more detailed planning or implementation. This creates 
a ‘recursion’ among the elements, from higher level to lower le vel. For example, the Strategy “Ensure that the stock of 
available vehicles never falls below an acceptable level” in cludes sub-Strategies appropriate to each geographic region. 
8.3.12.2  Interrelating Courses of Action — Enabling
One Course of Action can be enabled by another Course of Action. In other word s, the latter Course of Action provides 
basic support that makes the former Course of Action viable. This connection should generally be used to associate like 
instances; that is, Strategies only to other Strategies and Tactics only to other Tactics.
For example, the Strategy “Ensure that the stock of available ve hicles never falls below an acceptable level” is enabled by 
the Strategy “Maintain vehicles in good working condition.” For another example, the Tactic “Provide each member of 
the sales force with a palmtop” enables the Ta ctic “Input sales orders at the source.”
8.3.12.3  Interrelating Business Policies
One Business Policy can include  other Business Policies; a Business Policy can be  included in other Business Policies. In 
other words, there can be a ‘parts explosi on’ of Business Policies. For example, th e Business Policy “Safety first” can be 
decomposed into more specific policies that de al with vehicle safety and workplace safety.

38              Business Motivation Model, v1.38.4 Expressing Core Elements of  the Business Motivation Model
It is expected that statements an enterprise gives representing its Ends and its Directives will be laden with words that are 
judgmental, qualitative, and/or comparative. Indeed, the inclus ion of such words is one fundamental characteristic of 
these elements. 
These ‘qualitative’ (judgmental or comparative) words should be  avoided in expressing Missions, Strategies, and Tactics 
when the words actually refer to a desired end-state. Statemen ts containing such words should be carefully analyzed and 
then re-stated as appropriate Desired Resu lts or Directives. Indeed, the absence of adjectives suggesting desired end-states 
is one fundamental way in which Courses of Action ar e distinguished from Desired Results and Directives.
However, qualitative words may be used in Courses of Action if the words do not refer to the end-state desired. For 
example, the Tactic “ship products for free”  includes the adjective ‘free.’ This is valid word usage in a Course of Action 
since it does not describe the Desired Result.
8.5 Influencers and Assessments
To fully understand the elements of busines s plans, it is necessary to identify the Influencers that shape them. This helps 
communicate the full intent of the Means and Ends by e xplaining the context in which they were formulated.
Influencers, however, are neutral; they ar e more or less simply just ‘there’ un til someone makes an Assessment about how 
they are likely to impact some End or Means. Influencers should always be stated in a neutra l, factual manner. Therefore, 
Influencers should be devoid of qualitative words. Th e presence of qualitative words indicates a statement about  an 
Influencer; in other words, an Assessment. 
This sub clause describes the concepts that define these aspects of the Busine ss Motivation Model. Understanding these 
elements supports intelligent revision of the business plans, pos sibly well after the business plans and related application 
system(s) have been implemented.
8.5.1 Influencers on the Ends and Means
An Influencer can be anything that has the capability to ‘produc e an effect without apparent exertion of tangible force or 
direct exercise of command, and often without deliberate effo rt or intent.’ The Influencers specifically of concern to 
business plans are those that can impact the enterprise in its  employment of Means or ach ievement of its Ends. This 
impact has influence that is judged in  Assessments.
Influencers should not simply be named but described as we ll. Such amplification commun icates sufficient background 
and/or contextual information for other planning par ticipants to make appropria te, relevant Assessments.Table 8.11 - Examples of “qualitative”words
Best Biggest Clear
Closest Convenient CourteousDurable Effective EfficientExpedient Fast(est) Leading-EdgeLow(est)-cost Premier ProfessionalReliable Responsive Quickest
Business Motivation Model, v1.3        39In describing Influencers, remember th ey are always neutral, and must be assessed  to determine implications for business 
plans. Suppose a statement is made that ostensibly describes some Influencer. If it appears that a Business Rule can be 
derived directly  from the statement, then the statement is almost certainly not an Influencer. For example, consider the 
statement “The company color is blue.” This leads directly to  the Business Rule “Each web site screen must contain the 
company color blue.” Because no Assessment needs to be made, the statement is of an other kind – in this case most likely 
a Business Policy.
In describing Influencers, it is also useful to document who recognizes  the Influencer and at what point in time, so that an 
audit trail exists for future re ference. This practice, of course, cannot always be mandated.
8.5.2 Categories of Influencer
Influencers impact an enterprise’s employment of means or achievement of ends. There are two built-in categories of 
influencer:
• External: an influencer that is outside the enterprise’s organizational boundaries. 
• Internal: an influencer from  within the enterprise.  
Beyond these, an enterprise can define whatever Influencer Cate gories it requires. Enterprises that do not have a preferred 
set of categories may choose to use th e default set provided in Annex G, modifying and extending it as required.
This default set provides general categories that are us ed for examples and discussion in this specification.
It is suggested that each Influencer is categorized as (at least) one of the genera l categories and as either internal or 
external, as described in the following tables.
Influencer Categories may themselves be categorized in broader categories; a narr ower category may be included in more 
than one broader category.
Management of consistency when Influenc ers are categorized in multiple categori es is a matter for methodology, practice 
and tools, and is beyond the sc ope of this specification.
8.5.2.1 Example: External Influencers
External Influencers are those outside an enterprise’s organizational boundaries that can impact its employment of Means 
or achievement of Ends. Influencer Categories usually also categorized as External Influencer include the following:
Table 8.12 - Influencer Categories usually categorized as External Influencers
Influencer Category Description
Competitor A rival enterprise in a struggle for advantage over the subject enterprise.
Customer A role played by an individual or enterprise  that has investigated, ordered, received, or paid 
for products or services from the subject enterprise.
Environment The aggregate of surrounding conditions or Influencers affecting the existence or 
development of an enterprise.
Partner An enterprise that shares risks and profit with  the subject enterprise (or is associated with the 
subject enterprise to share risks and prof it) because this is mutually beneficial.
40              Business Motivation Model, v1.3Examples of External Influencer include the following:  Regulation An order prescribed by an authority such  as a government body or the management of an 
enterprise.
Supplier A role played by an individual or enterpri se that can furnish or provide products or services 
to the subject enterprise.
Technology The role of technology, including its  developments and limitations — there may be 
prerequisites for use of technology; there may be  enterprise activity that technology enables 
or restricts.

Enterprise Internal Influencer Category
44              Business Motivation Model, v1.3Figure 8.12 - Influencer and Influencing Organization
An Influencing Organization is an organization that is external  to the enterprise modeled in a given enterprise BMM, and 
that influences that enterprise.
An Influencing Organization  is the source of Influencers. An Influencer may have multiple sources, or none. 
The Model also supports Organization Category for categoriza tion of Influencing Organizations, but does not provide a 
default set of categories. Enterprises can define whatever Organization Catego ries they need. Organization Categories 
may themselves be categorized in broader categories; a na rrower category may be included in more than one broader 
category.
An Organization Unit from the same organization as the en terprise modeled in a BMM can act as an Influencing 
Organization for some Influencers. An Organization Unit playing this role would normally be outside the boundary of the 
enterprise modeled in the BMM. 
For example, a Directive on working conditions from the Hu man Resources Department ma y have to be treated as 
Regulation by an operating department, such as Production. The Human Resources Department, from the perspective of 
the Production Department, would be acting like an external regu lator. Similarly, there might be internal sources for other 
kinds of Influencer, such as Customer, Competitor, Technology.
8.5.4 Directive as Regulation
One Influencer Category, Regulation, is explicitly defined in the Model.

Business Motivation Model, v1.3        45Figure 8.13 - Directive as Regulation
This supports the requirement discussed in sub clause 8.3.6 fo r Directive to be able to act as a Regulation within an 
enterprise.
8.5.5 Assessing the Impact of In fluencers on Ends and/or Means
Influencers are neutral; they are more or less simply just ‘there’ until someone makes an Assessment of them as they 
relate to Ends and/or Means. Su ch an Assessment represents a  judgment of  an Influencer with respect to its  impact on 
Ends and/or Means. Specifically, the As sessment indicates that the Influencer affects the employment of  Means and/or 
affects the achievement of  Ends, in certain ways.
Figure 8.14 - Concepts for Assessments of Influencers on Ends and/or Means
If an Assessment is related to both a Means and an End, then this suggests that the particular Means is somehow related 
to the particular End. Specifically, if there is not a fact re lating them, such as ‘Course of Action channels efforts towards 
Desired Result’ or ‘Directive supports achievement of Desired Result,’ then careful consideration should be given to that 
omission.

46              Business Motivation Model, v1.38.5.6 Assessment
An Assessment is a judgment of  some Influencer that affects the organizatio n’s ability to employ its Means or achieve its 
Ends. In other words, an Assessment expr esses a logical connection (i.e., fact ty pe) between Influencers and the Ends and/
or Means of the business plans. In this way, an Assessment indicates which Influe ncers are relevant to which Ends and/or 
Means.
Different people or groups of people10 might make different Assessments of the very same Influencers on the very same 
Ends and Means, and perhaps even the same  person or group of people at different points in time. It is very important to 
indicate which person or group of people makes  which Assessment of an Influencer at which point in time, so that an 
audit trail exists for future reference. This practice, of course, ca nnot always be mandated.
Figure 8.15 - Assessment and Directive
An Assessment can provide the impetus for  Directives that govern  Courses of Action and/or support the achievement of  
Ends. In other words, the Directive  is motivated by  the Assessment.
10. Organization Unit. The BMM does not elabor ate organizational structures  – their importance is rec ognized, but they are outsi de 
the scope of the model.

Business Motivation Model, v1.3        478.5.6.1 Use of Assessments by Assessments
Assessments can also use other assessme nts, as illustrated in Figure 8.16.
Figure 8.16 - Assessment Uses Assessment
Typical use of this association is connecting an assessment  to other assessments referenced while arriving at the 
judgment. These associations can then  be used for many purposes, including:
• Decision support for making new assessme nts - identifying the full set of co ncerns taken into account in earlier 
assessments.
• Compliance audit - justifying decisi ons made in reacting to change. 
8.5.6.2 Categories of AssessmentThe BMM supports a general categorization structure for Assessme nt, as illustrated in Figure 8.17. 
Figure 8.17 - Categories of Assessment
Categories of assessment may themselves  be categorized in broader categories; a narrower category may be included in 
more than one broader category.
SWOT (Strength, Weakness, Opportunity, Threat) is a frequently-used set of cate gories for Assessment. There are other 
approaches, but if an enterprise does not  have another preferred set, SWOT is a sound default. The Assessment Category 
definitions for SWOT are provided in  Annex G: Categorization Defaults.
SWOT is used as the illustrative approach for discussi on and examples in the rest of this specification. 

48              Business Motivation Model, v1.38.5.6.3 Strength
This category of Assessme nt indicates some advantage or area of excelle nce within the enterprise that can impact its 
employment of Means or achievement of Ends. Some examples of Strength As sessments are listed below:
8.5.6.4 Weakness
This category of Assessme nt indicates some area of inadequacy within th e enterprise that can impact its employment of 
Means or achievement of Ends. Some examples  of Weakness Assessments are listed below: Table 8.16 - Examples of Strength Assessments
Enterprise Strength Affects
EU-Rent Infrastructure : geographical distribution of branches Appeal to business customers.
EU-Rent Implicit corporate values : environment-friendly, value 
rather than price – good positioning of EU-Rent, differentiating from competitors.Promotion to all customers as a 
‘premium brand.’
EU-Rent Resource : rental branch managers – ground-level 
leaders of the customer-facing business. Building branch networks around major 
cities and airports.

Enterprise Weakness Affects
EU-Rent The software for internet rentals has few facilities for 
self-service of corporate rental agreements (e.g.,

shortage of experienced staff in branches. This can cause delays in dealing with  exceptions and problems. Provision of high-quality customer

Business Motivation Model, v1.3        498.5.6.5 Opportunity
This category of Assessment indicates that some Influe ncer can have a favorable impact on the organization’s 
employment of Means or achievement of Ends. For example,  the bankruptcy of Pizza Company’s major competitor in 
Region-Y is assessed to be an Opport unity in its Goal “To increase market share.” Some examples of Opportunity 
Assessments are listed below: 
8.5.6.6 Threat
This category of Assessment indicates that some Influenc er can have an unfavorable impact on the organization’s 
employment of Means or achievement of Ends.
Some examples of Threat Assessments are listed below:
8.5.7 Potential Impact 
An Assessment records judgments about the impact (or potentia l for impact) of some Influencer on Ends and/or Means in 
terms of Potential Impacts. In  other words, an Assessment identifies  some Potential Impact(s) that  is/are significant to  that 
Assessment. Each Potential Impact is an evaluation that quantif ies or qualifies some aspect of  an Assessment in specific 
terms, types, or dimensions.Table 8.18 - Examples of Opportunity Assessments

convenience for business customers.
50              Business Motivation Model, v1.3A Potential Impact  significant to  an Assessment can provide the impetus for  Directives that govern  Courses of Action or 
support the achievement of  Ends. An Influencer may lead to the creation of a Business Policy only through an Assessment 
having been made that identifies  some Potential Impact.
Figure 8.18 - Assessment and Potential Impacts
8.5.7.1 Categories of Potential Impact 
Potential Impacts are categorized as follows:
• Risk
• Potential Reward
Typically, Risks are regarded to be negative imp acts, whereas Rewards are considered positive.
Where there is more than one Assessment associated with a si ngle instance of an End or Means, the total impact should 
be evaluated to uncover tradeoffs between Risks and Poten tial Rewards. This is the basis of risk/benefit analysis.
8.5.7.2 Risk
A Risk is a category of Impact Value that indicates the impact and probability of loss. Some Risks are expressible as 
formulae:
• Probability of loss (e.g., 5% probability)
• Potential loss (e.g., $500,000 loss)
• Unit-of-measure (e.g., loss in USD)

Business Motivation Model, v1.3        51 
8.5.7.3 Potential Reward
A Potential Reward is a category of Potential Impact that indicates the probability of gain. Some Potential Rewards are 
expressible as formulae, for example:
• Probability of gain (e.g., 30% probability)
• Potential gain (e.g., $40,000 gain)
8.5.8 EU-Rent Example: Reaction to Influencers
EU-Rent needs to decide how it wants to position itself in the car rental market.
• ‘Premium’ car rental companies, such as Hertz and Av is, have a ‘high quality, value for money’ image. ( These EU-
Rent Competitors are External Influencers .)
• Customers generally accept that the rate s for premium companies will be hi gher than the ‘cheap and cheerful’ 
competition. Customers tend to see ‘ on-airport’ companies as premium, and ‘off-airport’ companies as cheap and 
cheerful. ( These Customers – determined by market rese arch – are External Influencers for EU-Rent .)
• EU-Rent thinks there is room for co mpetition in the premium market. ( This is an Opportunity Assessment .)
• EU-Rent decides that it wants to be a premium car rental company.  (This is a Goal .)Table 8.20 - Examples of Risk
Enterprise Assessment Risk
EU-Rent Opportunity  - room for competition in the 
‘premium brand’ car rental market.Failure to position EU-Rent as a premium 
brand risks loss of an estimated 15% of current 
customers without replacement by new customers.
EU-Rent Opportunity  - targeting business customers and  
increasing rental rates.Many unrented cars at weekends, with rates 
undercut by the ‘cheap and cheerful’ 
competition.
EU-Rent Threat  - stringent emission control requirements 
in Scandinavia have to be met by any EU-Rent car that might be driven in Scandinavia.Severe financial penalties for failure to comply.
Table 8.21 - Examples of Potential Reward
Enterprise Assessme nt Potential Reward
EU-Rent Opportunity - room for competition in the 
‘premium brand’ car rental market. Market acceptance would support an average 
increase of 12% on rental rates.In moving up-market, EU-Rent expects to 
replace at least 15% of its current customers. 
EU-Rent Opportunity - improved management of 
depreciation of cars.Reduction of depreciation costs by 3%.
52              Business Motivation Model, v1.3• To achieve this, EU-Rent decides to be nation-wide in each of its countries of operation, focusing on major airports, 
and to compete head-to-head, on-airport, with other premium car rental companies. ( This is a Strategy .)
• A problem for on-airport car rental companies is that all th e competitors offer similar type s of car, and are physically 
lined up in a row. (This Environment is an External Influe ncer for EU-Rent.) There is very little room for maneuver on 
product, service, or price. ( This is a Weakness Assessment .)
• This on-airport constraint on pricing means that depreciatio n on cars between their purchase as new cars, and their sale 
at the end of their rental life will be a critical factor in financial success ( This is an Opportunity Assessment. ) In 
response to this, EU-Rent decides that depreciation of cars mu st be minimized. ( This is a Business Policy .)
• EU-Rent has a Strategy for car pur chase and disposal, covering: 
• what models to buy from which manufacturers,
• what overall numbers and mix and cars to buy,
• when to dispose of cars, by mileage and age,• how to phase purchasing and delivery of cars, etc.
• Within this Strategy, EU-Rent develops Tactics11 for its “minimize depr eciation” Business Policy, and Business Rules 
to govern and guide thes e Tactics. For example: 
• Create standard specificat ions of car models, selecting from options of fered by the manufacturers – this is a trade-
off.  
11. These Tactics will be realized in Business Processes. As be fore, however, the detailing of these Business Processes is outsi de the 
scope of the BMM.Table 8.22 - Examples of Tactics and Business Rules
Tactics Business Rules
Create standard specifications  of car models, selecting 
from options offered by the manufacturers; this is a 
trade-off between ‘rentable’ and ‘high residual value for 
sales.’Each Car purchased must match the standard specification of 
its Car Model.
Equalize of use of cars across rentals. The Car assigned to a Rental must be: at the time of 
assignment, of the available Cars in the requested Car Group, the one with the lowest mileage.
Comply with manufacturer’s maintenance schedule. Any Car whose odometer reading is greater than (next service 
mileage – 200) must be scheduled for service.
A Rental cannot be extended by phone if the Car’s odometer 
reading is greater than (next service mileage – 500). The Customer must bring it to a EU-Rent branch for a change of car.
Business Motivation Model, v1.3        538.6 Placeholders
Four concepts (Asset, Organization Unit, Bu siness Process, and Business  Rule) have roles in the structure of the Business 
Motivation Model but actually belong in other standards, wher e they are defined and associ ated with related concepts 
needed for detailed business modeling.
The defaults for the required external standards are OMG’ s specifications for Business  Process Model and Notation 
(BPMN) and Semantics of Busine ss V ocabulary and Business Rules (SBVR). In practice, enterprises could use alternative 
external standards.
Business Rule is a core concept of the BMM (albeit that its  definition is adopted from SB VR). Business Processes in a 
BMM are placeholders for association with concepts in BPMN. OMG does not have a general specification for 
organization structure. BMM place holders for Organization Units reference parts of the organization structure used in the 
enterprise’s operational business.
Assets, discussed in sub clause 8. 6.3, are not yet referenced to an y particular OMG specifications.
8.6.1 Organization Unit
It is difficult to avoid references to ‘W ho’ in discussions of ‘Why.’ Generally, it is  not adequate to say, “the motivation is 
that the company wants it that way.” This leads to the perpet uation of unnecessary rules — unnecessary either because the 
business requirement for them has passed, or because they were not Business Rule s in the first place (e.g., they were 
imposed as workarounds in systems that did not fully support business needs).
Being able to pin down the motivation more precisely is essent ial. After all, if a responsible party cannot be found for a 
rule, it should probably be challenged. The Model therefore supports identifying those parties who play key roles with 
respect to motivation.
This capability is reflected in the Model by linking elements of  the business plans to specific parts of the organization 
(i.e., its Organization Units). This ha s been done where the connection is im portant for developing, analyzing, 
challenging, and maintaining the business plans.
These logical connections (i.e., fact types) include the following:
• Organization Unit is responsible for  Assets
• Organization Unit is responsible for  Liabilities
• Organization Unit defines  Ends
• Organization Unit establishes  Means
• Organization Unit acts as  Influencing Organization
• Organization Unit recognizes  Influencers
• Organization Unit makes  Assessments
• Organization Unit  is defined by  Strategies
• Organization Unit is responsible for  Business Processes
54              Business Motivation Model, v1.3Figure 8.19 - Organization unit
8.6.2 Business Process
To expand on the ‘being-doing’ relationshi ps between Ends and Means, Business Processes need to be considered.
It is widely recognized that Business Proc esses and Business Ru les are closely related. It is important to be clear on the 
differences.
Business Processes realize  Courses of Action; they provide detail of  activities, plus sequencing, control, and 
synchronization that enable the enterprise to undertake its Courses of Action. Business Rules guide  Business Processes; 
they provide the basis for decisions that n eed to be made within Business Processes.

Business Motivation Model, v1.3        55Business Processes, Courses of Action, and Business Rules are all developed to help the enterprise reach its Goals. They 
need to be coherent and consistent. This is feasible if they are governed by a coherent and consiste nt set of Business 
Policies.
Business Processes  are governed by Business Policies, which
• Provide guidance (both directly and via Courses of Action) on what Business Processes have to do.
• Set limits on how Business Processes may undertake what they have to do. 
Figure 8.20 - Business Process
‘Business Process’ in the Model is a placeholder for a concept to be adopted from an external standard, such as BPMN.
Each Business Process is the responsibility of some Organization Unit (the proces s owner). There are other facts 
connecting Business Process and Organization Unit; for example,  assignment of activities in Business Processes to roles 
in the organization is the basis of workflow. However, these connections are again outside the scope of the BMM, and are 
appropriately addresse d by other standard(s).
8.6.3 Asset and Liability
When Courses of Action are being defined, ‘things’ that are used in operating the enterprise often have to be considered. 
They are represented in the M odel as Assets, of two kinds:
• Fixed Assets - things that are kept long-term, maintained, re used, and perhaps eventual ly replaced. They can be 

56              Business Motivation Model, v1.3tangible, such as equipment an d buildings, or intangible, such as patents and licenses. 
• Resources - things that are consumed and replenished, such as raw materials, parts, finished goods, and cash.
Two things should be kept in mind. Firstly, the term “Asset” ha s an accounting flavor, but it is not used in that sense in 
the Model. Most BMM users will probably have an operational pers pective. They will want to refer to the real things in 
the business (the actual equipment, buildi ngs, and stocks of materials) and that is  what “Asset” means in the Model. The 
accounting perspective would be the monetary values, rather than th e things themselves. 
Also, a BMM can include Assets that might not be explicitly valu ed financially, such as skills of people in the enterprise.
Secondly, Asset, Resource, and Fixe d Asset are placeholders (referenc es to things defined in detail elsewhere in the 
enterprise ) outside its BMM. Only those that are relevant to governance decisions need to be included. There is no 
requirement for a coherent, complete structure of Assets within a BMM; that will be maintained in the system(s) 
referenced by the BMM placeholders. 
One type of Asset that is often explicitly  referenced is the enterprise’s products  and services, called “Offering” in the 
Model. An Offering is a specification of a product or service - an intangible Fi xed Asset. Instances of it, such as 
quantities of finished goods, would be a Resource.
As well as Assets, enterprises also need to consider Liabilities - again, not in an accounting sense. A Liability in the 
Model is a reservation of Resource(s) to meet commitments, such as materials needed to fulfill a contract, or cash to pay 
taxes. 
These concepts are illustrated in Figure 8.21.
Figure 8.21 - Asset and Liability
Some Fixed Assets provide  Resources in the form of capacity over time (for example, production equipment, storage 
buildings, skills possessed by people). The Resources they provid e are either consumed, or are dissipated as time passes 
without their being used. 

Business Motivation Model, v1.3        57Offerings (specifications of  products and services) may use intangible Fixed Assets, such as  designs, licenses, patents, and 
brands. An Offering requires  Resources (materials, equipment capacity, people’s time) for production of things that meet 
the specification. 
A Liability claims  Resources (it reserves resources needed to meet  commitments), which means that the resources cannot 
be used for other purposes. 
Figure 8.22 illustrates connection of Asset and Liability to the rest of the Model.
Figure 8.22 - Asset and Liability Associations
Courses of Action may
• deploy  Assets: determine how Assets will be assigned and used in realizing the Courses of Action. 
• define  Offerings, the products and services that can be supplied by the enterprise.
• discharge Liabilities: ensure that commitments are met.

58              Business Motivation Model, v1.3A Directive may govern use of  Assets, regardless of which Courses of Action deploy  them. 
Other placeholders may be associated with As sets and Liabilities. Bu siness Processes may
• deliver  Offerings
• manage  Assets
An Organization Unit may be responsible for  Assets and/or Liabilities. 
8.7 Associations between co ncepts of the same type
Some BMM associations are between concepts of the same type, playing different roles:
• Enabling Course of Action enables Enabled Course of Action
• Broader Course of Action includes More Specific Course of Action
• Broader Desired Result includes  More Specific Desired Result
• Broader Desired Result Category categori zes Narrower Desired Result Category
• Broader Assessment Category categor izes Narrower Assessment Category
• Using Assessment uses Used Assessment
• Broader Business Policy includ es More Specific Business Policy
• Broader Organization Category categori zes Narrower Organization Category
• Broader Influencer categorizes Narrower Influencer Category
This type of association has two constraints.
First, such associations are transitive. For example, if Course  of Action ‘A’ includes Course of Action ‘B,’ and Course of 
Action ‘B’ includes Course of Action ‘C,’ then Course of Ac tion ‘A’ includes Course of Action ‘C.’ This is obviously 
true for ‘includes,’ but it is also true for other verbs in this type of association. For example:
• If Course of Action Z requires Course of Action Y to enable  it, and Course of Action Y requires Course of Action X to 
enable it, then Course of Action Z requires Course of Action X to enable it.
• If Desired Result Category P categorizes Desired Result  Category Q, then any Desired Result Category that 
categorizes Desired Result Category P also  categorizes Desired Result Category Q.
Second, loops of association are not permitted. For example,  if Desired Result Category P categorizes Desired Result 
Category Q, then neither Desired Resu lt Category Q nor any of its descendant s in ‘categorizes’ associations may 
categorize Desired Result Category P or any of its ancestors in  ‘categorizes’ associations.
Tools that support BMM should ensure that these constraints are enforced.
Business Motivation Model, v1.3        599 BMM Concepts Catalog
9.1 General
This clause presents the full Concepts Catalog for the BMM as a business vocabulary represented in SBVR Structured 
English, which is described in  the OMG’s specification for SBVR . 
In SBVR Structured English, the simple  passive form of a verb phrase is assu med. A synonymous form for the reverse 
reading is needed only if the simple passive form is not used. For example, given ‘business policy governs business 
process,’ ‘business pr ocess is governed by business policy’ is implied. But ‘business rule is derived from business policy’ 
is included as an explicit synonymous form for ‘business policy is basis for business rule.’

Note Processes can be defined at any level from  enterprise-wide Processes to Processes performed 
by a single person (from BPMN Clause 10, Process). 
Note An Activity is work that is performed within  a Business Process. The types of Activities that 
are a part of a Process are: Task , Sub-Process, and Call Activity, which allows the inclusion of

knowledge, describing or prescribing what is possible or allowable standard on which a 
judgment or decision may be based [
ODE “rule” ]
62              Business Motivation Model, v1.3Note ‘Practicable’ means that a person who understands a directive could observe a relevant 
situation (including his or her own behavior) and recognize directly whether or not the business was complying with that directive. 
For rules that govern activity (SBVR ‘operative business rule’) this recognition is about the 
behavior of people and what fo rm compliant behavior takes. Fo r example, “each rental must be 
guaranteed by a valid credit card he ld by the renter of the rental.”
For definitional rules (SBVR ‘structural business rule’) this recognition is about evaluation of 
the criteria vested in the rule to produce consistent outcomes for decisions or calculations. For 
example, “a car model requested for a rental must  be a car model of the car group specified for 
the rental.”

9.5 Mapping of SBVR Structured English fact types to UML  
Association Names
BMM concept names are represented in the UML model of B MM in “CamelCase.” Each word of the concept name (as 
given in SBVR Structured English) begins with a capital le tter, and there are no spaces between words. For example, 
course of action  is represented in the UML model as CourseOfAction.
Each noun concept in the BMM Concepts Catalog is represented as a class in  the UML model, with its name in 
CamelCase. 
Most fact types (verb concepts) in the BMM Concepts Catalog are represented as associations in the UML model. 
Association names are formed by:
• Selecting the active form of the ve rb in the verb concept, e.g., implements  rather than  is implemented by .
• Using the whole verb concept repr esentation in CamelCase, e.g., tactic  implements strategy  is represented by the 
association TacticImplementsStrategy.
The exception is ‘category of’ (specializa tion) fact types, such as “objective is  a category of desired result” which are 
often embedded in definitions and not explicitly named in SB VR Structured English. They are shown on the UML model 
as un-named generalization-sp ecialization associations. 
The following table provides the complete mapping.

Business Motivation Model, v1.3        739.6 Mapping of SBVR Structured Eng lish Fact Types to UML Role Names
In the BMM Concepts Catalog, role names are defined for fact  types in which both roles are played by the same noun 
concept (e.g., broader business policy  includes more specific business policy ). They are used in the corresponding 
association names in the BMM UML/MOF mode l, and represented in CamelCase, except  that the first letter is in lower 
case (e.g., broader business policy ) maps to broaderBusinessPolicy. 
For other fact types, UML role name s have been constructed using the ve rb and the noun concept term (e.g., tactic  
implements  strategy ) maps to the UML role names impleme ntingTactic and implementedStrategy.

BMM Diagram as Orig inally Published
(Informative)
This annex presents the BM M as published by the BRG on www.businessrulesgroup.org.
The graphic representation of the Business Motivation Model is based on three non-normative conventions, as follows.  
These conventions have been purposely ke pt neutral of any particular modeling notations. The BRG selected conventions 
are largely self-explanatory and visually intuitive.
• Box:  A box of any size represents a co re concept. The name in the box is th e preferred term (nam e) given to that 
concept.  Refer to the Concepts Catalo g for the precise mean ing of each term.  
• Box-Within-A-Box:  This indicates categorization — in other words, a box within a box indi cates that one concept is a 
category of the other concept.  Another way to think about th is is that the inner box represents a specific kind, type, 
class, or variation of the outside box.  
This graphic representation of categories does not impl y any constraints; specifically it does not imply that:
• The list of categories is mutual exclusive.
• The list of categories is exhaustive.
• Any category is mandatory.    
When any of these constraints do apply, that fact is always documented explicitly in the Concepts Catalog. 
• Connection-Between-Boxes:  A line connecting any two boxes (or the same box twice) indicates a logical connection 
– that is, a fact type – between core concepts.
Crucial to any line is its labels . These labels are written carefully as verbs or verb phrases (in both directions) so that the  
logical connections of the Model can be read as simple English se ntences. These sentences c onvey the exact meaning of 
the connections in the context of the Model; however, more expl anation is given in the Concepts Catalog, along with the 
definitions for each of the terms involved.
This graphic representation of logical connections (fact type s) does not imply any constraints; specifically it does not 
imply that: 
• The logical connection is mandatory for any concept involved.
• Any upper or lower limits apply to the logical connection.
When any such constraint does apply, that fact is always documented explicitly in the Conc epts Catalog. In the absence 
of such documented constraint, the connection lines can be taken to represent simple unconstrained fact types (i.e., 
‘many-to-many’ and optional in both directions).  
Two special conventions are worth noting.  
• When a fact type involves three or more concepts, a simple line cannot be used to represent the fact type.  In this case, 
the fact type is shown as a concept box, named with a term for the fact type (shown suffixed with *) and having 
78              Business Motivation Model, v1.3unlabeled lines radiating from the box to th e fact type’s participating concepts.  On e reading of the fact type is given in 
a Legend.  
• A shaded (orange) box represents a concept that is related to concepts of the Model but this concept does not, itself, fall 
within the scope of the Model.

Business Motivation Model, v1.3        79Annex B:
Metrics for the BMM
(Informative)
Implicit in many areas of the Business Motivation Model is the subject of metrics. In almost all organizations there are 
‘things of interest’ that are heavily measured and tracked.1 These metrics govern, control, and influence a wide range of 
important aspects of the organization. The very fact thes e ‘things’ are so heavily meas ured makes them important.  
Some of the most important metrics of an enterprise are es tablished by its Goals. Each Goal can have one or more 
measures of performance. For example, a metric of the Goal “To be profitable” is  the measure of performance ‘annual net 
revenue.’  Another measure of performance of this Goal might be ‘monthly net revenue.’
Some of the example Goals presented earlier have been  extended below to illustrate measures of performance:
Objectives should always be measurable . Therefore Objectives, by definition, w ill have metrics. The metrics for an 
Objective are established by the measures of performance of the Go al that the Objective quantifie s. To be able to do this, 
an appropriate unit-of-measure for the me tric must be determined for each Obj ective. The Objective then expresses the 
target value that the metric should attain in the timeframe sp ecified. In that way, while a Goal sets the direction, its 
corresponding Objectives set the milestones to be attained in pu rsuing the Goal. For example, to quantify the Goal “To be 
profitable” the enterprise might set one Objective to have a monthly net revenu e of at least $5 million (by a specified 
date) and another Objective to have an annual net revenue of at least $1 00 million (by a specified date).  
1. Rule management is outside of the scope of the Model; however, the enterprise should consider Bu siness Rules to be one of the  
‘things of interest’ that it carefully ‘mea sures and tracks.’  Management of rules over time is important  not only to performan ce 
assessment and improvement, but also addresses related issues, such as response to change s in Influencers. Table B.1 - Measures of performance
Enterprise Goal Measure(s) of Performance

Publishing company To improve customer satisfaction (over the next five 
years).customer satisfaction

years).customer satisfaction
e-Business company To improve customer satisfaction (over the next five 
years).market share
80              Business Motivation Model, v1.3Metrics are imperative for Potential Impacts. Without thoughtf ul and careful identification of appropriate metrics, the 
Risk / Potential Reward eval uation becomes meaningless.  
If a metric is particularly important, it may attain a special status and be called a Key Perfo rmance Indicator (KPI), or a 
Critical Success Factor (CSF), or someth ing else. The choice of signifier is un important. The enterprise will decide on 
many different things to be measured2.  Each of these measurements will have differing degrees of importance relative to 
the attainment of some Objective or set of Objectives. The fa ct that the enterprise has decided to measure, evaluate, and 
act on the results of the metrics is the important thing.
2. In fact, if the Zachman Framework is used , it is possible to identify important ‘thi ngs’ to be measured in virtually every ce ll.
Business Motivation Model, v1.3        81Annex C:
Background for EU-Rent Examples
(Informative)
This annex provides an overview of the fictitious car rental  company used for examples throughout the specification.
EU-Rent is a car rental company that operates in several count ries in Western Europe and North America. In each of its 
countries of operation, EU-Rent has an operating company that defines a number of local area s in which it locates rental 
branches and service depots. 
EU-Rent rents cars to customers, and of fers standard models from major manufact urers. Car models are categorized into 
groups ranging from ‘economy’ to ‘luxury,’ with a different tariff for each group. 
Rental branches do not own specific cars. Each local area owns a pool of cars that are available to the rental branches in 
the area. Each branch has an allocation (capacity, not actual cars) from the pool, which it uses to meet demand for rental 
bookings. If it exhausts its allocation it can request additional capacity, which is provided from a reserve pool on a ‘first 
come, first served’ basis. 
Tariffs are set nationally. The operational rental business is mana ged mainly at the local area and branch level, with fairly 
strong national guidance on car purchase and disposal – what mo dels can be purchased, how long to keep them, etc. – and 
global guidance on customer service and the EU-Rent brand.
EU-Rent accepts both rental bookings in advance and walk-in rentals. Advance bookings are accepted by phone, Internet, 
or in person in branches. An EU-Rent branch can accept a booking for pick-up at any EU-Rent branch world-wide. 
EU-Rent is a medium-sized company catering to the ge neral car rental market. It has two major concerns: 
• It is facing increasing competition fr om companies offering lower rates, es pecially in vacation and resort areas.
• It sees opportunities for expansion as Eastern European countries enter the European Community, and business and 
trade increase.
In response, EU-Rent has decided to:
• Position itself in the market as a ‘premium’ brand, alongside the bigge r players such as Hertz and Avis.
• Expand into Eastern Europe, focusing on major business centers.
• Target business renters, in two ways:
• As individuals, offering convenient locations, high-quality service (value for money rather than lowest possible 
price), and an attractiv e loyalty rewards scheme for frequent renters.
• As companies, offering corporate agreements in which di scounted rental tariffs are offered in return for ‘captive 
business.’
EU-Rent represents itself as environment-friendly and uses electric and LPG cars where suitable models are available.

Business Motivation Model, v1.3        83Annex D:
The BMM in the Context of the Zachman 
Architecture Framework
(Informative)
D.1 General
John Zachman has provided a useful context for discussing the architecture of an enterprise. His ‘Framework for 
Enterprise Architecture’ [ZACH] is a matrix that describes th e various ways the stakeholders of an enterprise view the 
business and its systems.   
The Framework characterizes architecture in terms of the perspe ctives of the different stake holders (represented by rows 
in the matrix) and focuses on the different aspects (or ‘abs tractions’) of architecture (represented by the columns). The 
rows represent, successively, the Planner, Owner, Designer, Builder, and Subcontractor perspectives. The columns reflect 
the abstractions dealing with the aspects of Data, Process,  Location, Role, Timing, and Motivation (What, How, Where, 
Who, When, and Why).  
The Business Motivation Model a ddresses the business Owner’s perspective (i.e.,  row two) of the sixth aspect (i.e., the 
Motivation or ‘Why’ column)1. Indeed, the name of the Model directly  reflects this focus on motivation.  
Also noteworthy is that the positioning of the Model in row two means that all refe rences to Business Rules in the Model 
describe or prescribe elements involved in the structure a nd operation of the business — not its information systems or its 
technology.  
D.2 Relationship to Other As pects of the Business Model
As acknowledged at the beginning of this document and again ju st above, motivation is just  one aspect of a complete 
business model. So, while every effort was made to limit the scope of the Model to  this single abstraction, selective 
reference to elements of other abstrac tions were sometimes necessary — specifica lly, to concepts of the ‘Who’ and ‘How’ 
columns. 
D.3 The ‘Who’ Connections
It is difficult to avoid references to ‘Who’ in discussions of ‘Why.’ Generally, it is not adequa te to say, ‘the motivation is 
that the company wants it that way.’ This leads to the perpet uation of unnecessary rules — unn ecessary either because the 
business requirement for them has passed, or because they were not Business Rule s in the first place (e.g., they were 
imposed as workarounds in systems that did not fully support business needs). 
Being able to pin down the motivation more precisely is essent ial. After all, if a responsible party cannot be found for a 
rule, it should probably be challenged. The Model therefore supports identifying those parties who play key roles with 
respect to motivation.  
1. The BRG's 1995 paper [BRWATR] addressed the first and sixth aspects (that is, the data and motivation columns) from the 
Designer’s perspective (t hat is, row three).  
84              Business Motivation Model, v1.3This capability is reflected in the Model by linking elements of the business plans to specif ic parts of the organization 
(i.e., its Organization Units). This has been done where the connection is important for developing, analyzing, 
challenging, and maintaining the business plans.  
The Model uses the following definition for ‘organization’ on a provisional basis: “Any named group of people within the 
enterprise with a purpose and a budget.” An Organization Un it is simply an organization that is part of another 
organization.  
These definitions should be c onsidered merely placeholders2. As stated in the main body of the document, ‘Organization 
Unit’ does not fall within the scope of the Model. In term s of the Framework, Organization Unit remains part of the 
‘Who’ abstraction. 
D.4 The ‘How’ Connections
To expand on the ‘being-doing’ relationships between Ends and Means, the ‘How’ column of the Framework needs to be 
considered. ‘How’ is specified as Business Processes. 
It is widely recognized that Business Proc esses and Business Ru les are closely related. It is important to be clear on the 
differences. 
Business Processes realize Courses of Action – they provi de detail of activities, plus  sequencing, control, and 
synchronization that enable the enterprise to undertake its Co urses of Action. Business Rules guide Business Processes – 
they provide the basis for decisions that need  to be made within Business Processes. 
Business Processes, Courses of Action, and Business Rules are all developed to help the ente rprise reach its Goals. They 
need to be coherent and consistent. This is feasible if they are governed by a coherent and consiste nt set of Business 
Policies.
Business Processes are governed by Business Policies, which:
• Provide guidance (both directly and via Courses of Action) on what Business Processes have to do.
• Set limits on how Business Processes may undertake what they have to do. 
‘Business Process’ in the Model is a placeholder for a concept adopted from the OMG’s Business Process Model and 
Notation (BPMN) specification.
Each Business Process is the respons ibility of some Organization Unit (the process owner). There are other facts 
connecting Business Process a nd Organization Unit; for example, assignment of  activities in Business  Processes to roles 
in the organization is the basis of workfl ow. However, these connections are again outside the scope of the Model, and are 
appropriately addressed by some other standard(s). 
D.5 Additional Aspects of the Business Model
The other abstractions of the Framework at row 2 are si gnificant in a complete business model. For example, 
• The ‘Where’ aspect — a Logistics Model identifying wher e the business will operate and how those locations are 
linked together. Such a model might also prescribe appli cation of Business Rules in different places (including 
differences that need to be accommodated in globalization of the enterprise). 
2. In 2006, the OMG issued an RFP for an Organization Structure Me tamodel, from which a standard is  expected to emerge by 2008.  
Business Motivation Model, v1.3        85• The ‘When’ aspect — an Event Model describing the events in the business cycle and how  those events cause changes 
or activities in the enterprise.
In addition, all six abstractions of the Framework have poten tial interdependencies. For example, workflow to accomplish 
the same Ends may be different fo r different categories of location.

 BMM History
(Informative)
E.1 Releases
The Business Motivation Model was developed by the Business  Rules Group (BRG) and made freely available from the 
BRG web site (www.business rulesgroup. org). There have been three releases : of the Business Motivation Model: 
• Release 1.0 was published in November 2000 as “Organizing Business Plans ~ The Standard Model for Business Rule 
Motivation.”
• Release 1.1, a general update in resp onse to feedback from practice, was p ublished in January 2005 under the 
revised title “The Busine ss Motivation Model - Business G overnance in a V olatile World.”
• Release 1.2, some minor changes in response to OMG RFC requirements, was pub lished in September 2005. 
E.2 Release 1.0
E.2.1 Preface to Release 1.0
E.2.1.1 Background
In 1995, the Business Rules Group1 (BRG), then under the auspices of GUIDE  International published a seminal work, 
“Defining Business Rules ~ What Are They Really?” That document focused on understandi ng Business Rules from an 
information system perspective. That work provides key insights  on the basic structure of Business Rules — that is, what 
Business Rules really are. 
Since 1997, the BRG has focused its energies on understanding Bu siness Rules from a business perspective. This in turn 
required a full, business-oriented understa nding of how the elements of business plans should be organized. The BRG 
found that although many professionals have us ed planning methodologies over the years,  no standard existed in that area, 
and many of the basic concepts were hazy  and ad hoc. In particular, there was no  inclusion of Business Rule in such 
approaches - a crucial omission. 
This document presents the work of the BRG to correct th ese problems. It reflects the consensus of the BRG, and 
collectively the members’ many years of practical experience , about business planning. The BRG believes that business 
plans, especially as they relate to e ngineering business proc esses that include automated components, can and should be 
organized according to the elements of the Model presented in this document. 
E.2.2 Organization of this Document
Note: this section is from the preface to the BRG paper de scribing release 1 of the Business Motivation Model. It 
describes that document, not the OMG specification of BMM.
1. For more on the background and hist ory of the BRG, refer to [BRGHIST]
88              Business Motivation Model, v1.3This document centers on an explanation of the Model. It be gins by describing two major to pical areas and the role they 
play. 
Section 2 describes the major concepts of the Model in broa d terms — Ends and Means, In fluences, and Assessments of 
those Influences on the Ends and Means. 
Sections 3 and 4 are the heart of the doc ument, presenting Model concepts in de tail. As well as providing the concept 
descriptions that define the Model, th ese sections contain numerous examples. 
Many of these examples ar e based on a (fictitious) car rental company, EU-Rent,2 that continues the case study the BRG 
used in its earlier report. Although there ar e individual examples drawn from other so urces, EU-Rent provides at least one 
example of every concept, within the context of a single orga nization. This provides some coherence across the examples 
and illustrates the relationships between many of the concepts. 
The other examples were taken selectively from a wide set of enterprises. While the BRG used  real-world samples as the 
basis for these examples, it discovered that real-world sample s often do not conform exactly to the prescriptions for the 
various concepts presented in this document. The BRG found that  the wording of these real-world statements is typically 
an amalgamation using language designed for the consumption of  vested audiences. Therefore, the samples have been 
reworded as appropriate for use with th e Model. The BRG believes this is an imp ortant part of the value of its work. 
Section 5 briefly discusses metric s in the context of the Model. 
E.2.3 The Annexes
Annex A.  The Model is included in graphic form in Annex A, which makes for handy reference. 
Annex B.  The real meaning of the concepts in the Model is in the concept definitions. These definitions are an integral 
part of the Model — indeed, the Model diagram is meaningles s without them. Annex B contains all the definitions in the 
form of a Glossary of Definitions, which th e BRG prefers to call the Concepts Catalog3. 
Annex C.  The Model is diagrammatically presented in this doc ument using neutral, non-normative conventions. These 
conventions, explained in Annex C, are intended only for visu al illustration of the Model's concepts and fact types. 
Annex D.  The document uses many examples from the EU-Rent case study, an overview of which is presented in Annex 
D.
Annex E.  The positioning of the Model with respect to the Zach man Architecture Framework is discussed in Annex E, 
which also comments on other artifacts  of business models, including Orga nization Unit and Business Process.
Annex F.  A bibliography of relevant referenc e material is presented in Annex F.
E.2.4 Audiences for the Model
Who are the audiences for the Model? Primary audiences include the following: 
• Developers of business plans. For that audience, the Model is a conceptual tool for engineering the business itself. 
• Analysts supporting the developers of business plans. For that audience, the Model is a tool for organizing and 
clarifying business plans.
2. The EU-Rent case study was developed by John Hall of Model Systems.
3. “Semantics of Business V ocabulary and Bu siness Rules” [SBVR] focuses on concepts, rather than merely on terms. Therefore the 
Group prefers the name ‘Concepts Catalog,’ rather than ‘Glossary of Definitions.’
Business Motivation Model, v1.3        89• Implementers and users of software tools and repositories : For that audience, the Mode l is a formal scheme for 
structuring information about such business plans. 
A final point is this. The BRG uses the word ‘enterprise’ in this document for convenience. The enterprise can be either 
for-profit or not-for-profit — similar concepts apply. Also, the ‘enterprise’ can be some subset of a larger enterprise; 
again, similar concepts should apply.

E.3 BMM Releases 1.1 and 1.2
E.3.1 Preface to Release 1.1 
The time lapse between Release 1. 0 and Release 1.1 of the Busine ss Motivation Model is just over four years. The Model 
has shown remarkable stability during that period. This brief Preface to Release 1.1 identifie s the relatively small number 
of updates and improvements to the Model that the Busine ss Rules Group (BRG) has made . These changes were based 
on:
90              Business Motivation Model, v1.3• application of the Mo del in actual practice.
• suggestions from various conferences and presentations in Europe and North America.
• world-wide feedback via the BRG’s website.
• intense work starting in 2003 on “Semantics of Business V ocabulary and Business Rules” (SBVR), a response to an 
RFP produced by the Object Management Group (OMG) entitled “Business Semantics of Business Rules.” 
Perhaps the most notable changes in Release 1.1 are (a) th e new name for the Model itself, “The Business Motivation 
Model,” and (b) the new title of this document, “The Busi ness Motivation Model ~ Business Governance in a V olatile 
World.” The BRG received compelling arguments that the origin al name of the document, “Organizing Business Plans ~ 
The Standard Model for Business Rule Motivation,” did not accurately reflect the purpose and content of the Model. 
These arguments were centered on two main points:
• ‘Business Plan’ means many things to many people, and generally has broader connotations than the BRG intended. 
For example, “schedule of planned business activities” co mes to mind for some people, whereas “proposed plan 
created to attract venture capital” come s to mind for others. Rather, the focus of the Model is on the elements of 
business governance (e.g., strategies, tactics, policies, goals, objectives, etc.); how these elem ents are inter-related; and 
what purposes they serve – i.e., their business motivation.
• Although the Model does address the business motivation for bus iness rules – after all, busi ness rules are certainly an 
element of business governance – including ‘business rule’ in the title of the document gave it a prominence that outweighed its actual role. In fact, as noted below, the Model does not even define Business Rule, but rather will adopt the definition from “Semanti cs of Business V ocabulary and Business Rules” (SBVR).
As mentioned above, the structure of the Model in Releas e 1.1 has changed very little from Release 1.0. The most 
significant adjustments involve sharpened definitions. For exampl e, a dictionary basis has been  added for each term in the 
Model. Beyond that, several concepts have be en renamed, and several fact types have  been added or revised. In addition, 
numerous examples have been added throughout the document.
The only new concept added to the Model is a placeholder fo r Business Process. The BRG has recognized the need to 
indicate how Business Process is related to the elements of  the Model, and this placeholder permits it to do so. By 
placeholder, the BRG emphasizes that it is not suggesting any standard view of Busi ness Process; instead, that it intends 
to defer to other standards activities for relevant definition(s). For example, work  is currently being undertaken in the 
OMG to develop a standard Business Process Definition Metamodel (BPDM).
The final noteworthy adjustment in Releas e 1.1 is that an outside definition has been adopted for ‘Business Rule.’ As 
noted earlier, the focus of this document is on the elements of  business governance and, in the Model, Business Rules are 
viewed as simply one such element. As in the case of th e placeholder for Business Proc ess, the adopted definition for 
Business Rule permits the BRG to indicate how Business Rules re late to other elements of the Model, but to defer to other 
standards activities for comprehensive definition and treatment.

E.3.2 Preface to Release 1.2
In September 2005, the Object Management Group (OMG) voted  to accept the Business Motivation Model as the subject 
of a Request for Comment (RFC). This means that the OMG is willing to consider the Bu siness Motivation Model as a 
specification to be adopted by the OMG, subj ect to comment from any interested parties.
4. For succinct discussion of the fundamental principles of the Business Rule approach, refer to [BRGMAN] available in a variety  of 
languages, including: E nglish, German, Dutch, French, and Turkish.
Business Motivation Model, v1.3        91Adoption as an OMG specification carries the intention that the Business Motivation Model would, in time, be submitted 
to the International Standards Or ganization (ISO) as a standard.
One of the OMG’s conditions for RFC acceptance was an explicit statement about attributes that would be required to be 
included in compliant implementations of the Business Mo tivation Model. This has been included in Section 1.4.

Business Motivation Model, v1.3        93Annex F:
Related OMG Business Modeling Specifications
(Informative)
F.1 Need for Integration
Business-oriented modeling in the OMG ha s been addressed by initiatives for severa l specifications independently and in 
parallel, with the intention of integrati ng them later. Compatibility between the de velopments is being handled informally 
in binary collaborations between submission teams.  
This is different from the development of , for example, the UML, where all aspects of Platform Independent Models were 
developed as a coherent whole.
The OMG specifications of particular rele vance to the Business Motivation Model are:
• Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN)
• Semantics of Business V ocabulary and Business Rules (SBVR)
These need to be integrated because they are so closely related in business-oriented modeling.  
A first step towards integration could be provision of simple  cross-referencing in a Business Motivation Model for the 
enterprise. The minimum requirement would be:
• Reference schemes for Organization Unit, Business Process and Business Rule that supported unique identification of 
their instances. 
• Availability of the references outside the tools that su pport Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN), Semantics 
of Business V ocabulary and Business Rules (SBVR), and th e organization structure model used by the enterprise. 
Specifically, these references should be available to a tool that supports the Business Motivation Model. 
F.2 Business Process Mode l and Notation (BPMN)
The fragment of the Business Motivation Model that  addresses Business Proc ess is illustrated below.
94              Business Motivation Model, v1.3Figure F.1 - Business Process fragment of BMM
The concept ‘Process’ in the BPMN specif ication [BPMN] is adopted as BMM’s defi nition of ‘business process’ (see sub 
clause 9.1)
The concept ‘Performer’ in the BPMN specification [BPMN] corresponds in BMM to organization unit’s role as being 
responsible for business process.
F.3 Semantics of Business Vocabu lary and Business Rules (SBVR)
The fragment of the Business Motivation Model that addresse s Business Rule and Business Policy is illustrated below.

OMG does not have a general specification for organization structure. A broad definition for Organization Unit is 
provided in Clause 9. BMM pl aceholders for Organization Un its are references to units in the organization unit model 
used by the enterprise.
The concept ‘Performer’ in the BPMN specification [BPMN] corresponds in BMM to organization unit’s role as being 
responsible for business process.

Business Motivation Model, v1.3        97Annex G:
Defaults for Categorization
(Informative)
G.1 General
The Business Motivation Model does not prescribe fixed catego ries of Assessment or Influencer. This annex describes 
categories for both that are recommended by the Business Rule s Group (developers of the original Business Motivation 
Model) as default sets for enterprises that do not already have preferred categories.
G.2 SWOT Assessments
An Assessment is a judgment about some Influencer that affe cts the organization’s ability to employ its Means or achieve 
its Ends. A widely-used scheme for categoriz ing assessments is that the effect of the influencer indicates a Strength or 
Weakness of the enterprise, an Opportunity fo r, or a Threat to, the enterprise (SWOT). 
The relevant fragment of the BMM MOF Model is illustrated in .
Figure G.1  -  Assessment Category
In a tool that supports the BMM, an enterprise that wa nted to use SWOT would define four new instances of 
AssessmentCategory: “Strength,” “Wea kness,” “Opportunity,” and “Threat.”
The enterprise could also defi ne other Assessment Categories.
It is left to methodology and practice, and perhaps capabilitie s of BMM support tools, to manage multiple categorization 
of Assessments.
To extend its business vocabulary (as expres sed in the Concepts Catalog in SBVR St ructured English) the enterprise could 
add the following entries. 
opportunity
Definition assessment  that an influencer can have a favorabl e impact on the empl oyment of means or 
achievement of ends.

G.3 Categories of Influencer
An influencer is something that has the capability of causing the enterprise to assess whethe r employment of its needs or 
achievement of its ends could be affected by the influencer. It is  useful to be able to categori ze influencers to assist in, fo r 
example, analysis of what kinds of change caused the enterp rise to react, and what assessments and decisions were made. 
The BMM does not mandate any particular se t of categories. However, the categories  here provide a useful default set for 
enterprises that do not have a preferred set of categories. They were built up by the Business Rules Group out of their 
practice in using and developing the BMM up to  the time when it was adopted by the OMG.
The relevant fragment of the BMM MOF Model is illustrated in Figure G.2.
Figure G.2 - Influencer Category
In a tool that supports the BMM, an ente rprise that wanted to use the default set of categories described below would 
define a new instance of As sessmentCategory for each one.
The enterprise could also defi ne other Influencer Categories.
There are three sets of Influe ncer Categories described here:
1. A general set of categories that have been frequently used  in practice, including Competition, Regulation, Corporate 
Value, Technology.  
 

Business Motivation Model, v1.3        992. Internal/External (built into BMM)l, for categorization of influencers as being from inside or outside the enterprise 
boundaries. For example, influencers in the general category ‘Customer’ would usually be external; influencers in the 
general category ‘Management Prerogative’ would usually be internal. 
3. Implied/Explicit, for categorization of influencers as be ing explicitly described or ‘just known’ by people in the 
enterprise. For example, a co rporate value “You take problems to your boss - you don’t go over your boss’s head” 
might be implied - not officially published by the company, but understood by employees. 
A given influencer would typically be categorized as being of one or more general categories, and as either ‘internal’ or 
‘external.’ Implied/Explicit categoriza tion is used for corporate values. The default suggestions for multiple 
categorizations are summarized in Table G.1.
Table G.1 - Suggested combinations of categories
These suggestions are not exhaus tive. For example, an enterprise might want to categorize an influencer as internal 
technology or another as  external assumption. 
It is left to methodology and practice, and perhaps capabilitie s of BMM support tools, to manage multiple categorization 
of Influencers.
To extend its business vocabulary (as expres sed in the Concepts Catalog in SBVR St ructured English) the enterprise could 
add the following entries.
