Background
In 1995, the Business Rules Group, then under the auspices of GUIDE International
published a seminal work, "Defining Business Rules ~ What Are They Really?"1  That
document focused on understanding Business Rules from an information system perspective.
That work provides key insights on the basic structure of Business Rules — that is, what
Business Rules really are.  The document is the source of the fundamental idea that Business
Rules are always Terms, Facts, or Rules.
Since 1997, the Business Rules Group has focused its energies on understanding Business
Rules from a business perspective.  This in turn required a full, business-oriented
understanding of how the elements of business plans should be organized.  We found that
although many professionals have used planning methodologies over the years, no standard
existed in that area, and many of the basic concepts were hazy and ad hoc.  In particular,
there was no inclusion of Business Rules  in such approaches — a crucial omission.
The current document presents the work of the Business Rules Group to correct these
problems.  It reflects the consensus of the Group — and collectively their many years of
practical experience — about business planning.  We believe that business plans, especially as
they relate to engineering business processes that include automated components, can and
should be organized according to the elements of this work — that is, the Business Rule
Motivation Model.
Organization of this Document
This document centers on an explanation of the Business Rule Motivation Model.  It begins
by describing two major topical areas and the role they play in an overall model of the
business.
Section 2 describes the major concepts of the Business Rule Motivation Model in broad
terms — Ends and Means, Influences, and Assessments of those Influences on the Ends and
Means.
Sections 3 and 4 are the heart of the document, presenting the Business Rule Motivation
Model concepts in detail.  As well as providing the concept descriptions that define the
model, these sections contain numerous examples.
Many of them are based on a (fictitious) car rentals company, EU-Rent, that continues the
case study we used in our earlier report.  Although there are individual examples drawn from
other sources, EU-Rent2 provides at least one example of every concept, within the context
of a single organization.  This provides some coherence across the examples and illustrates the
relationships between many of the concepts.

Copyright, 2000.  The Business Rules Group vi rev. 1.0The other examples were taken selectively from a wide set of enterprises.  While the Group
used real-world samples as the basis for these examples, we discovered that real-world
samples often do not conform exactly to the prescriptions for the various concepts presented
in this document.  We found that the wording of these real-world statements is typically an
amalgamation — using language obviously designed for the consumption of vested audiences.
Therefore, we have reworded the samples as appropriate for use with the Business Rule
Motivation Model.  We believe this is an important part of the value of our work.
Section 5 summarizes the discussion by placing the Business Rule Motivation Model and its
concepts into the context of the Zachman Framework.  We conclude with a look forward at
some of the next topics that have been identified for further investigation.
The Business Rule Motivation Model is included in graphic form in Appendix A, which
makes for handy reference.  However, the real meaning of the concepts it presents is in the
concept definitions.  These definitions are an integral part of the Business Rule Motivation
Model — indeed, the model diagram is meaningless without them.  The Concepts Catalog
(Appendix B) contains the concept definitions.  Appendix C is a bibliography of relevant
reference material.
Audiences for the Business Rule Motivation Model
Who are the audiences for the Business Rule Motivation Model?  Primary  audiences include
the following:
•Developers of business plans .
For that audience, the Business Rule Motivation Model is a conceptual tool for
engineering the business itself.
•Analysts supporting the developers of business plans .
For that audience, the Business Rule Motivation Model is a tool for organizing and
clarifying business plans.
•Implementers and users of software tools and repositories .
For that audience, the Business Rule Motivation Model is a formal scheme for
structuring information about such business plans — in other words, a model .3
A final point is this.  We use the word "enterprise" in this document for convenience.
Clearly, the enterprise can be either for-profit or not-for-profit — similar concepts apply.
Also, the "enterprise" can be some subset of a larger enterprise; again, similar concepts should
apply.
                                                
3 Such a formal scheme is sometimes called an ontology .

Organizing Business Plans                       The Standard Model for Business Rule Motivation
                                                                                                                                                     
Copyright, 2000.  The Business Rules Group 1 rev. 1.01. Introduction
The Business Rule Motivation Model provides a scheme or structure for developing,
communicating, and managing business plans in an organized manner.  Specifically, the
Business Rule Motivation Model does all of the following:
•It identifies factors that motivate the establishing of business plans.
•It identifies and defines the elements of business plans.
•It indicates how all these factors and elements inter-relate.
Among these elements are ones that provide guidance to the business — most notably,
Business Rules.
1.1 What is the Business Rule Motivation Model?
There are two major areas of the Business Rule Motivation Model.
•The first is the Ends and Means of business plans.  Among the Ends are things the
enterprise wishes to achieve — for example, Goals and Objectives.  Among the
Means are things the enterprise will employ to achieve those Ends — for example,
Strategies, Tactics, Policies, and Business Rules.
•The second is the Influences that shape the elements of the business plans, and the
Assessments made about the impacts of such Influences on Ends and Means (i.e.,
Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats).
The Ends, Means, and Influences are related to each other in order to answer the following
two fundamental questions:
1.What is needed to achieve what the enterprise wishes to achieve?
This question is answered by laying out the particular elements of the business plans
— in other words, the Means necessary to achieve the desired Ends.
2.Why does each element of the business plan exist?
This question is answered by identifying the particular Ends that each of the Means
serves, and the Influences that underlie the choices made in this regard.  This is what
is meant by motivation .
Business Rules play an important role in development of business plans.  For example, they
can serve the following purposes:
•Make business tactics sufficiently well developed to guide the actual performance of
work.
•Provide fallback positions when some element of the business plans fails.
•Resolve conflicts when the Ends the business seeks are in conflict with one another.
Organizing Business Plans                       The Standard Model for Business Rule Motivation
                                                                                                                                                     
Copyright, 2000.  The Business Rules Group 2 rev. 1.0Because of this key role — which is often make-or-break for the very success of business
plans — developing the motivation for Business Rules from the  business perspective is
fundamentally important.
Indeed, all elements of the Business Rule Motivation Model are developed from a business
perspective.  The basic idea is to develop a business model  for the elements of the business
plans before  system design or technical development is begun.  In this manner, the business
plans can become the foundation for such activity, connecting system solutions firmly to
their business intent.
1.2 Other Elements of a Full Business Model
The elements of the Business Rule Motivation Model are not complete as a full business
model.  For example, the elements of business plans prescribe neither of the following, both
of which are essential parts of a complete business model.
•Workflows .  The identification and sequencing of particular tasks, and the assignment
of responsibilities for such tasks, still remains to be worked out even after the
business planning is completed.  However, the business plans will provide the
outlines of the approach that can be used in developing such workflows.
•Information Structure .  Also remaining to be developed is complete specification of
the Terms and Facts needed to support the business.  However, the business plans do
provide a business basis for such development — namely, the concepts and
vocabulary used in the elements of the business plans, particularly in its Business
Rules.
In addition to the above, a complete business model would also include a Functional Model
of the business describing all the processes of the enterprise, a Logistics Model  identifying
where the business will operate and how those locations are linked together, and an Event
Model  describing the events in the business cycle and how those events cause changes or
activities in the enterprise.
1.3 Methodologies and the Business Rule Motivation Model
It is also important to note that the Business Rule Motivation Model is not in any sense a
methodology.  Indeed, it is entirely neutral with respect to methodology or particular
approach, with only several general exceptions as follows:
•The requirements development process should be business-driven.
•Organized business plans should be a fundamental deliverable in any such process.
•Business Rules are a key element of such business plans.

Copyright, 2000.  The Business Rules Group 3 rev. 1.01.4 The Graphic Representation of the Business Rule Motivation Model
The graphic representation of the Business Rule Motivation Model is based on three
conventions, as follows.  These conventions have been purposely kept neutral of any
particular modeling notations.  We selected conventions that are largely self-explanatory and
visually intuitive.
•Box:  A box of any size represents a core concept.  The name in the box is the
preferred Term (name) given to that concept.  Refer to the Concepts Catalog for the
precise meaning of each Term.
•Box-Within-A-Box :  This indicates subsetting — in other words, a box within a box
indicates that one set of elements is a subset of another set of elements.  Another way
to think about this is that the subset box represents a specific kind, type, class, or
variation of the larger box.
There is no assumption in this graphic representation that boxes within boxes imply
mutual exclusivity or represent an exhaustive or mandatory list of subsets.  When
actual subsets in the Business Rule Motivation Model are in fact mutually exclusive
this constraint is documented in the Concepts Catalog.  When subsets are completely
enumerated and required as shown, these constraints are documented in the Concepts
Catalog.
•Connection-Between-Boxes :  A line connecting any two boxes (or the same box
twice) indicates a logical connection between core concepts.  Such a line represents a
type of Fact.
Actually, what is important about the lines are the labels.  These are written carefully
as verbs or verb phrases (in both directions) so that the Facts of the Business Rule
Motivation Model can be read as simple English sentences.  These sentences convey
the exact meaning of the connections in the context of the Business Rule Motivation
Model; however, more explanation is given in the Concepts Catalog, along with the
definitions for each of the Terms involved.
The rules that apply to these constructs are also part of the Business Rule Motivation
Model.  However, these rules are not expressed in the model graphics.  For example, the
connection lines represent simple unconstrained Facts (i.e., "many-to-many" and optional in
both directions).  While the diagram may suggest some rules (for example, when boxes within
boxes suggest mutually exclusive subsets), the final word on any rule is documented in the
Concepts Catalog.

Copyright, 2000.  The Business Rules Group 4 rev. 1.02. Overview of the Business Rule Motivation Model
In this document Business Rules are described from the enterprise perspective.  The Group is
not attempting to develop a methodology, rather to create a model that supports a range of
methodological approaches.  One way to think of the Business Rule Motivation Model is as
a blueprint.  If it were implemented, the result would be a database in which Business Rules
could be stored and related to other information about the enterprise, whatever methodology
were used for discovering and defining them.
But there are some broad principles that should be generally applicable.  Perhaps the most
fundamental of these is understanding motivation .  Our rationale for approaching Business
Rules from this direction was simple:  if an enterprise imposes a rule, it ought to be able to
say why.
Sometimes it is difficult to uncover the motivation, especially in operations that have been
going on for some time.  All too often it turns out to be "..because we had to find a
workaround for a system that didn’t do quite what was needed."   This may describe business
work practice, information systems, or both.
The Group realized early on that a cornerstone of any work addressing motivation had to be
the enterprise’s aspirations (its Vision) and its action plans for how to realize them (its
Mission).  Refinements were introduced — Vision into Goals and Objectives, and Mission
into Strategies for approaching Goals, and Tactics for achieving Objectives.  The Group
adopted the general term End to refer broadly to any of the "aspiration" concepts (Vision,
Goal, Objective) and the term Means  to refer generally to any of the "action plan" concepts
(Mission, Strategy, Tactic).  This conjunction of Ends and Means — being  and doing  — gave
us the core concepts of our model.4
An enterprise, however, could not operate on this model alone — the business needs to take
into account the numerous Influences that can hinder or assist its operation.  These Influences
provide Opportunities that would help the enterprise operate, as well as Threats that would
thwart it.  Influences also represent Strengths from within that the enterprise could exploit, or
Weaknesses that it should compensate for.
But is an Influence inherently a Strength or Weakness — is it always a Threat or
Opportunity?  That determination comes from an Assessment of the impact of an Influence
on the stated Ends and Means — an Assessment such as is developed in SWOT analysis.  In
this popular technique, Internal Influences (assessed to be Strengths and Weaknesses) and
External Influences (assessed to be Opportunities and Threats) are analyzed as a part of
business plan development.5
                                                
4 In fact, this is the essential distinction between Ends (the being  — "what you aspire to be")
and Means (the doing  — "the actions you intend to take to get there").  We express this
distinction in our terms "Desired Result" and  "Course of Action."

Copyright, 2000.  The Business Rules Group 5 rev. 1.0Once an Assessment has identified relevant Influences in terms of their impact on Ends and
Means, Business Policies and Business Rules can be put in place to guide the enterprise
Courses of Action.  Business Rules sharpen the Business Tactics because they make Courses
of Action concrete at the operational level. Business Rules can also provide specific remedies
when a Course of Action fails, and specific resolutions to conflicts that inevitably arise
among the Ends.  In short, Business Rules provide the leverage needed for building effective,
adaptable business solutions and systems.  This is why understanding the motivation for
Business Rules is so crucial.
These Elements of Guidance keep the enterprise on course and moving toward its Desired
Results.  Because of their integral role in guiding Courses of Action, Elements of Guidance are
included in the set of Means  concepts.
With these major concepts identified, the Business Rule Motivation Model now seems to
provide a good framework for dealing with rules  and motivation .  When a Business Rule is
encountered, you can ask where it would fit — which Influence, on which End or Means,
does it address?  When a Business Rule does not seem to fit, it can be challenged.  Does it
perhaps support some older Means or End that is no longer relevant to the enterprise?  Was
it a workaround for some historical information system deficiency or organizational issue that
is no longer relevant?
The next section examines each of the concepts of the Business Rule Motivation Model in
detail to reveal how they work together to provide this kind of support.

Copyright, 2000.  The Business Rules Group 6 rev. 1.03. The Core Elements of the Business Rule Motivation Model
The main elements of the business plans are its Ends and Means.  These fundamental terms
represent two hierarchies, as shown in Figures 1 and 5.
3.1 The End Concepts
An End is a statement about what the business seeks to accomplish.  The important thing to
remember about an End is that it does not include any indication of how it will be achieved.
In describing Ends, it is useful to document who defined  the End and at what point in time, so
that an audit trail exists for future reference.  This, of course, cannot always be mandated.
Types of End
End concepts can be arranged in a hierarchy, as shown in Figure 1.
Figure 1: The Hierarchy of “End” Concepts
An End may be either a Vision or some Desired Result (a Goal or an Objective).  The essence
is that these are types of things, in varying detail, that the enterprise is trying to accomplish.
Vision is an overall image of what the organization wants to be or become.  It usually
encompasses the entire organization and is long-term in its perspective.  Desired Results, on
the other hand, are the more specific Goals and Objectives that the enterprise, or some part of
it, intends to achieve.

Copyright, 2000.  The Business Rules Group 7 rev. 1.0Vision
A Vision is a statement about the future state of the enterprise, without regard to how it is to
be achieved.
A Vision is the ultimate, possibly unattainable, state the enterprise would like to achieve.  A
Vision is often compound, rather than focused toward one particular aspect of the business
problem.  A Goal, in contrast, should generally be attainable and should be more specifically
oriented to a single aspect of the business problem.
A Vision is supported or made operative by  Missions.  It is amplified by  Goals.

Examples of Vision include the following:
Vision
EU-Rent Be the car rental brand of choice for business users in
the territories in which we operate.
Pizza Company Be the city's favorite pizza place.
Consulting Company Be the premier consulting company in the industry.
Retail Pharmacy Be the low-cost health care provider with the best
customer service.
Municipal Police
DepartmentBe a professional, trusted provider of police services
— a leader in cooperative efforts with the

A Desired Result is an End that is a state or target that the enterprise intends to maintain or
sustain.
Types of Desired Result
Desired Result includes the following concepts:
•Goal
•Objective
Figure 3: Desired Results -- Goals and Objectives
Compared to an Objective, a Goal tends to be longer term, qualitative (rather than
quantitative), general (rather than specific), and ongoing.  Compared to a Goal, an Objective
tends to be short term, quantitative (rather than qualitative), specific (rather than general), and
not continuing beyond its timeframe (which may be cyclical).  A Goal is supported by
Strategies.
Objectives differ from Goals in that Objectives should always be time-targeted and
measurable.  Goals, in contrast, are not specific in these ways.  An Objective is achieved by
Tactics.

Copyright, 2000.  The Business Rules Group 9 rev. 1.0Goal
A Goal is a statement about a state or condition of the enterprise to be brought about or
sustained through appropriate Means.  A Goal amplifies  a Vision — that is, it indicates what
must be satisfied on a continuing basis to effectively attain the Vision.
A Goal should be narrow — focused enough that it can be quantified by  Objectives.  A
Vision, in contrast, is too broad or grandiose for it to be specifically measured directly by
Objectives.  However, determining whether a statement is a Vision or a Goal is often
impossible without in-depth knowledge of the context and intent of the business planners.
Examples of Goal include the following:
Goal
EU-Rent To provide industry-leading customer service.
EU-Rent To provide well-maintained cars.
EU-Rent To have vehicles available for rental when and where
customers expect them.
Pizza Company To deliver pizzas in an expedient amount of time.
Consulting Company To improve customer satisfaction (over the next five
years).
Publishing Company To improve customer satisfaction (over the next five
years).
E-Business Company To have more customers than any other e-business.
Objective
An Objective is a statement of an attainable, time-targeted, and measurable target that the
enterprise seeks to meet in order to achieve its Goals.
•Attainable .  It is self-evident that Objectives should be attainable.  If they are not,
the business plans are unrealistic and will likely fail.
•Time-targeted .  All Objectives should be time-targeted.  This means that either an
absolute timeframe (e.g., "by January 1, 2001") or relative timeframe (e.g., "within
two years") should be included in each Objective.  This timeframe indicates when the
Objective is to be met.
•Measurable .  Objectives should be measurable.  This means they must include some
explicit criteria for determining whether the Objective is being met in practice.  This
criteria may be fairly exacting (for example, "on-time 95% of the time").  At the very
minimum, the criteria must provide a basis for making a "yes or no" determination
(e.g., "up and running").  Such criteria may be the basis for certain Business Rules,
created specifically to compute or derive the relevant evaluation.
The Group’s understanding of "Objective" is consistent with the industry's popular
"SMART" criteria that an Objective be:  Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and
Time-Based.

Copyright, 2000.  The Business Rules Group 10 rev. 1.0Statements of Objective should always begin with the time-targeted phrase, followed by a
quantified noun.
Example time-targeted phrases:
•By 09/01/2001, ...
•Effective immediately, ...
•After 2 years, ...
•Within 5 weeks, ...
•On or before June 1, 2002, ...
•On April 15, 2001, ...
An Objective quantifies  a Goal — that is, it provides the basis for measures to determine
whether the Goal is being achieved.  Conversely, the Goal is quantified by  these measurable
Objectives.  For example, the Goal:  "To provide industry-leading customer service" is
quantified by the Objective:  "Effective immediately, a ranking of 8 or better on a monthly
customer satisfaction scale of 1-10" and by the Objective:  "By Jan. 1, 2001, a B+ grade level
on the annual Better Business Bureau ratings."
Examples of Objective include the following:
Objective
EU-Rent Effective immediately, 98% of customers who ask to
rent a car get one.
Pizza Company By January 1, 2001, 95% on-time pizza delivery.
Consulting Company By June 30, 2002, an operational customer call center.
E-Business Company Within six months, 10% increase in product sales.

Copyright, 2000.  The Business Rules Group 11 rev. 1.0Facts that Organize Ends
Besides those mentioned above, other logical connections (i.e., Facts) are required to fully
organize the Ends.  These logical connections provide additional structure among elements of
the Ends themselves.
Interrelating Desired Results
One Desired Result can be composed of  other Desired Results; a Desired Result can be part of
some other Desired Result.  In other words, there can be a "parts explosion" of Desired
Results.  This connection should only be used to associate like instances — that is, Goals
only to other Goals and Objectives only to other Objectives.
Figure 4: Interrelating Desired Results
This happens when there is a decomposition of some higher-level Goal (or Objective) into
lower-level Goals (or Objectives).  This occurs, for example, when elements of the business
plans created by one level of management are handed down to a lower organizational level for
more detailed planning or implementation.  This creates a "recursion" among the elements,
from higher level to lower level.  For example, the Goal:  "To keep customers satisfied" is
composed of the sub-Goal:  "To deliver pizzas in an expedient amount of time" and the sub-
Goal:  "To produce tasty pizzas."

Copyright, 2000.  The Business Rules Group 12 rev. 1.03.2 The Means Concepts
A Means represents any device, capability, regime, technique, restriction, agency, instrument,
or method that may be called upon, activated, or enforced to achieve Ends.  Remember that a
Means does not indicate either the steps (workflow) necessary to exploit it, nor
responsibility for such tasks, but rather only the capabilities that can be exploited to achieve
the desired Ends.
In describing Means, it is useful to document who established  the Means and at what point in
time, so that an audit trail exists for future reference.  This, of course, cannot always be
mandated.
Types of Means
Means concepts can be arranged in a hierarchy, as shown in Figure 5.
Figure 5: The Hierarchy of “Means” Concepts
A Means may be either a Mission, a Course of Action (a Strategy or Tactic), or an Element
of Guidance (Business Policy or Business Rule).
Mission, like its counterpart Vision, indicates a correspondingly long-term approach — one
that is focused on achieving the Vision.  Like Vision, Mission is not very specific; it is
something broadly stated, in terms of the overall functioning of the enterprise.
Apart from the basic Mission of the enterprise, the Means of the Business Rule Motivation
Model have been carefully organized into Courses of Action and Elements of Guidance.
In some respects, Courses of Action are the more basic of the two because they lay out the
basic Courses of Action to be taken to achieve the Desired Results.  In and of themselves,
Organizing Business Plans                       The Standard Model for Business Rule Motivation
                                                                                                                                                     
Copyright, 2000.  The Business Rules Group 13 rev. 1.0however, Courses of Action tend to be rather like blunt instruments.  They require Elements
of Guidance to have any real chance of success.
In contrast to Courses of Action, Elements of Guidance cannot really stand on their own.
They exist to give the Courses of Action a fine edge — in other words, to ensure that the
Courses of Action will be applied intelligently and within the boundaries of what is
acceptable or optimal for the enterprise.  In short, Elements of Guidance represent encoded
(i.e., written down) knowledge that ensures the highest possible chances of success for the
Courses of Action.
An Element of Guidance always has to do with what is, or is not, permissible.  There can be a
meaningful Enforcement Level established for it.  A Course of Action, in contrast, identifies
an active approach in moving toward the Ends.  A Course of Action is always action-
dominated (action-oriented) rather than control-oriented.  An Element of Guidance is always
control-oriented.
Mission
A Mission indicates the ongoing operational activity of the enterprise.  The Mission
describes what the business is or will be doing on a day-to-day basis.
A Mission makes  a Vision  operative  — that is, it indicates the ongoing activity that makes
the Vision a reality.  A Mission is planned by means of  Strategies.
Figure 6: Mission
A Mission statement should consist of the following three items only and should be formed
using brief statements of them.
1.An action part. For example, “provide”
2.A product or service part. For example, "pizzas"
3.A market or customer part. For example, "customers city-wide"
The Mission statement should be focused on day-to-day operations, generic enough to cover
all Strategies, and broad enough to cover the complete area of operations.

augmentation services to companies in North

Retail Pharmacy Provide generic and ethical drugs to the retail
market.
Course of Action
A Course of Action is an approach or plan for configuring some aspect of the enterprise
involving things, processes, locations, people, timing, or motivation, undertaken to achieve
Desired Results.  Courses of Action, which include Strategies and Tactics, represent the basic
elements of a general plan or overall solution — in other words, an overall approach — that
the enterprise will take to achieve its Desired Results.  To this end, a Course of Action is
guided by  Elements of Guidance.
Types of Course of Action
Course of Action includes the following concepts:
•Strategy
•Tactic

Organizing Business Plans                       The Standard Model for Business Rule Motivation
                                                                                                                                                     
Copyright, 2000.  The Business Rules Group 15 rev. 1.0Compared to Tactics, Strategies tend to be longer term and broader in scope.  A Strategy is
implemented by  Tactics.  A Strategy always drives toward  Goals, rather than being
formulated to achieve Objectives.
Compared to a Strategy, a Tactic tends to be shorter term and narrower in scope.  Tactics
implement  Strategies; they are courses of action that will support those Strategies.  A Tactic
always is formulated to achieve  Objectives, rather than driving toward Goals.
Determining whether a Course of Action is a Strategy or a Tactic may be impossible without
in-depth knowledge of the context and intent of the business planners.  In fact, in the course
of developing and analyzing business plans, some elements may change type as the target
problem is understood better.  For example, an element originally defined as a Tactic may
subsequently be elevated to a Strategy.  The reverse is also likely to occur.  In other words,
the business plans will gradually evolve toward greater accuracy in specification, as well as
greater coherence and completeness.
Strategy
A Strategy is one  component of the plan  for the Mission.  A Strategy represents the essential
Course of Action to achieve Ends — Goals in particular.  A Strategy drives toward  those
Goals.
More than simply a resource, skill, or competency that the enterprise can call upon, a
Strategy represents the right  approach to achieve its Goals, given the environmental
constraints and risks the enterprise faces.
Examples of Strategy include the following:
Strategy
EU-Rent Join established rewards scheme  (rather than building
own scheme)
Pizza Company Deliver pizzas to the location of the customer’s
choice.
Consulting Company Implement a Customer Relationship Management
System
Consulting Company Increase repeat business
E-Business Company Buy other e-business mailing lists
Tactic
A Tactic is a Course of Action that represents part of the detailing of Strategies.  A Tactic
implements  Strategies.  For example, the Tactic:  "Call first-time customers personally"
implements the Strategy:  "Increase repeat business."
Tactics are formulated to achieve  Objectives.  For example, the Tactic:  "Ship products for
free" is  formulated to achieve the Objective:  "Within six months, 10% increase in product
sales."

Consulting Company Provide each member of the sales force with a
palmtop.
Consulting Company Call first-time customers personally.
E-Business Company Ship products for free.
Element of Guidance
As the name suggests, Elements of Guidance indicate how the Courses of Action should, or
should not, be carried out — in other words, they guide  Courses of Action.  Specifically, an
Element of Guidance is a declarative statement (or set of such statements) that defines or
constrains or liberates some aspect of an enterprise.  It is intended to assert business
structure or to control or influence the behavior of the business.
Figure 8: Interrelating Elements of Guidance with Courses of Action and Ends
Organizing Business Plans                       The Standard Model for Business Rule Motivation
                                                                                                                                                     
Copyright, 2000.  The Business Rules Group 17 rev. 1.0The Elements of Guidance guide  the Courses of Action.  For example, the Business Rule:
"Pizzas may not be delivered beyond a radius of 30 miles" guides the Strategy:  "Deliver
pizzas to the location of the customer’s choice."  This applies to Tactics as well.  For
example, the Tactic:  "Encourage rental extensions" is guided by the Business Policy:  "Allow
phone rentals."
It is expected that all Courses of Action should be guided by  some Element of Guidance,
especially as the business plans evolve and become more coherent and complete.  Any
Course of Action not guided by an Element of Guidance should be examined carefully to
discover potential omissions.
On the other hand, too many Elements of Guidance may become unduly constraining.  The
correct balance in this regard can only be identified by having in-depth knowledge of the
context and intent of the business people participating in the planning.
In striking this balance it should be remembered that, unless a Business Policy is made
explicit, it is assumed that no constraint on other elements of the business plans will be
exercised.  In other words, there is no such thing as an "unstated" Business Policy.  This also
applies to Business Rules.  Every Element of Guidance must be explicit and recorded in an
official manner.  This is a fundamental tenet of the Business Rule approach.
It is also possible for the Courses of Action to be formulated based on  Elements of Guidance.
For example, the Tactic:  "Monitor car mileage" is formulated based on the Business Policy:
"Cars should be serviced at the mileage intervals recommended by the manufacturer."  The
Element of Guidance thereby serves as the source of  the Course of Action.  Continuing on
with the same example, the Business Policy:  "Cars should be serviced at the mileage intervals
recommended by the manufacturer" is the source  of the Tactic:  "Monitor car mileage."
Occasionally an Element of Guidance is defined to support the achievement of  a Desired
Result directly.  For example, the Business Policy:  "The cell phone numbers of customer
representatives should be available to customers" supports achieving the Goal:  "To provide
high-quality customer support."  For a second example, the Objective: "Within six months,
10% increase in product sales” is supported by the Business Rule that defines product sales:
“Product sales must be computed as total sales, minus all of the following:  sales tax,
shipping charges, and maintenance contract fees."

Copyright, 2000.  The Business Rules Group 18 rev. 1.0Element of Guidance Enforcement Level
An Element of Guidance indicates its appropriate Enforcement Level.  An Element of
Guidance is subject to  an Enforcement Level.
Figure 9: Element of Guidance with Enforcement Level
Enforcement Levels represent alternatives in a graded or ordered scale, each of which indicates
the severity of action imposed to put or keep a rule or policy in force.  The values range from
"strictly enforced" to "guideline (suggestion only)"  as follows:
Value Meaning
strictly enforced If you violate the rule, you cannot escape the penalty.
deferred enforcement Strictly enforced, but enforcement may be delayed —
e.g., waiting for resource with required skills.
pre-authorized override Enforced, but exceptions allowed, with prior
approval.

Copyright, 2000.  The Business Rules Group 19 rev. 1.0Element of Guidance as Regulation
An Element of Guidance may act as  some other Organization Unit’s Regulation.  The
Business Rules and Business Policies determined at one level in an organization may be
effectively the law (Regulation) for lower-level organizations.
Figure 10: Element of Guidance as Regulation
For example, production and sales divisions both have to comply with company policy on
safety at work.  These units in turn have to determine their own local policies and rules for
their particular compliance with the "law" (company policy) imposed from above.
Furthermore, the rules and policies they come up with will most likely be unique; rules for
safety within the production division are different from those in sales.
Types of Element of Guidance
Element of Guidance includes the following concepts:
•Business Policy
•Business Rule
Compared to a Business Rule, a Business Policy tends to be less structured,6 less discrete,
and usually not atomic — that is, not focused on a single aspect of guidance.  Usually, its
articulation will be less careful than that for a Business Rule — in other words, a Business
Policy is less likely to follow a standard vocabulary.
In contrast to a Business Policy, a Business Rule is highly structured6 in its expression and is
carefully expressed in terms of standard vocabulary.  A Business Rule should be discrete and
atomic — that is, represent only a single aspect of guidance.
                                                
6 This means “structured” in a natural language sense, not “structured” in any technical sense.

Copyright, 2000.  The Business Rules Group 20 rev. 1.0Business Policy
A Business Policy is a statement (or set of statements) whose purpose is to guide the
enterprise.  Business Policies provide the  basis for  Business Rules.
A Business Policy can be motivated by  Assessments.  The formulation of a Business Policy,
which is always under the enterprise's control, is by some party who is authorized to
manage, control, or regulate the enterprise by selecting from a variety of alternatives in
response to one or more Assessments.
Business Policies that exist merely to enable a Strategy in a direct and trivial manner should
be avoided.  For example, suppose the enterprise has the Strategy:  "Encourage repeat
business."  A Business Policy that says "Repeat business should be encouraged" is trivial and
does not need to be expressed.
In general, Business Policies exist to control, guide, and shape the Strategies and Tactics.  For
example, the Business Policy:  "We will not make on-site visitations" shapes and guides the
Strategy:  "Encourage repeat business," as well as the specific Tactics that might be selected
to implement the Strategy.  Specifically, no Tactic requiring on-site visits will be permitted to
support the Strategy — even though on-site visits would probably be effective in that regard.
On the other hand, a Tactic involving sending coupons by mail would be acceptable under the
Business Policy since it involves no on-site visits.
Examples of Business Policy include the following:
Business Policy
EU-Rent Always attempt to send a customer away with a rented
vehicle, as long as the cost to EU-Rent for the
rental is not greater than the rental payment.
EU-Rent Safety first.
Pizza Company Safety in the kitchen, and in the streets, comes first.
E-Business Company A business representative will personally contact each
customer who makes a complaint.

Copyright, 2000.  The Business Rules Group 21 rev. 1.0Business Rule
A Business Rule is a directive, intended to influence or guide business behavior, in support of
Business Policy that has been formulated in response to an Opportunity, Threat, Strength, or
Weakness.  It is a single Element of Guidance that does not require additional interpretation
to undertake Strategies or Tactics.  Often, a Business Rule is derived from  Business Policy.
Examples of Business Rule include the following:
Business Rule
EU-Rent A customer must present a valid driver’s license in
order to rent a EU-Rent vehicle.
EU-Rent The rental of a car within 500 miles of its next service
mileage may not be extended by phone.

Besides those mentioned above, other logical connections (i.e., Facts) are required to fully
organize the Means.  These logical connections provide additional structure among elements
of the Means themselves.

Interrelating Courses of Action — Composition
One Course of Action can be composed of  other Courses of Action; a Course of Action can
be part of  other Courses of Action.  In other words, there can be a "parts explosion" of
Courses of Action.  This connection should only be used to associate like instances — that is,
Strategies only to other Strategies and Tactics only to other Tactics.
This happens when there is a decomposition of some higher-level Course of Action into
lower-level Courses of Action.  This occurs, for example, when elements of the business
plans created by one level of management are handed down to a lower organizational level for
more detailed planning or implementation.  This creates a "recursion" among the elements,
from higher level to lower level.  For example, the Strategy:  "Ensure that the stock of
available vehicles never falls below an acceptable level" is composed of sub-Strategies
appropriate to each geographic region.

Copyright, 2000.  The Business Rules Group 23 rev. 1.0Interrelating Courses of Action — Enabling
One Course of Action can be enabled by  another Course of Action.  In other words, the latter
Course of Action provides basic support that makes the former Course of Action viable.
This connection should only be used to associate like instances — that is, Strategies only to
other Strategies and Tactics only to other Tactics.
For example, the Strategy:  "Ensure that the stock of available vehicles never falls below an
acceptable level" is enabled by the Strategy:  "Maintain vehicles in good working condition."
For another example, the Tactic:  "Provide each member of the sales force with a palmtop"
enables the Tactic:  "Input sales orders at the source."
Interrelating Business Policies
One Business Policy can be  composed of  other Business Policies; a Business Policy can be
part of  other Business Policies.  In other words, there can be a "parts explosion" of Business
Policies.  For example, the Business Policy:  "Safety first" can be decomposed into more
specific policies that deal with vehicle safety and workplace safety.
Interrelating Business Rules
One Business Rule can relate to  other Business Rules.  Tracking down and analyzing these
connections is a crucial part of honing the business plans.
There are a variety of different ways in which Business Rules can relate to each other.  The
following are some of the manners in which Business Rules can be interrelated:

"conflicts with" case, other rules may be needed to guide actions when the conflict arises.
3.3 Expressing Core Elements of the Business Rule Motivation Model
It is expected that statements an enterprise gives representing its Ends and its Elements of
Guidance will be laden with words that are judgmental, qualitative, and/or comparative.
Indeed, the inclusion of such words is one fundamental characteristic of these elements.
Examples of such words include the following.
•Best •Biggest •Clear
•Closest •Convenient •Courteous
•Durable •Effective •Efficient
•Expedient •Fast(est) •Leading-Edge
•Low(est)-cost •Premier •Professional
•Reliable •Responsive •Quickest
These "qualitative" (judgmental or comparative) words should be avoided in expressing
Missions, Strategies, and Tactics when the words actually refer to a desired end-state.
Statements containing such words should be carefully analyzed and then re-stated as
appropriate Desired Results or Elements of Guidance.  Indeed, the absence of adjectives
suggesting desired end-states is one fundamental way in which Courses of Action are
distinguished from Desired Results and Elements of Guidance.
However, qualitative words may be used in Courses of Action if the words do not refer to the
end-state desired.  For example, the Tactic "ship products for free" includes the adjective
"free."  This is valid word usage in a Course of Action since it does not describe the Desired
Result.

Copyright, 2000.  The Business Rules Group 25 rev. 1.04. Influences and Assessments
To fully understand the elements of business plans, it is necessary to identify the Influences
that shape them.  This helps communicate the full intent of the Means and Ends by
explaining the context in which they were formulated.
Influences, however, are neutral — they are more or less simply just "there" until someone
makes an Assessment about how they are likely to impact some End or Means.  Influences
should always be stated in a neutral, factual manner.  Therefore, Influences should be devoid
of qualitative words.  The presence of qualitative words indicates a statement about  an
Influence — in other words, an Assessment.
This section describes the concepts that define these aspects of the Business Rule
Motivation Model.  Understanding these elements supports intelligent revision of the
business plans, possibly well after the business plans and related application system(s) have
been implemented.
4.1 Influences on the Ends and Means
Influence
An Influence is the act, process, or power of producing an effect without apparent exertion of
tangible force or direct exercise of command, and often without deliberate effort or intent.
The Influences of concern here are specifically those that can impact the enterprise in its
employment of Means or achievement of its Ends.  This impact is judged in  Assessments.
The Group recommends that Influences should not simply be named but described as well.
Such amplification communicates sufficient background and/or contextual information for
other planning participants to make appropriate, relevant Assessments.
In describing Influences, it is also useful to document who recognizes  the Influence and at
what point in time, so that an audit trail exists for future reference.  This, of course, cannot
always be mandated.

Copyright, 2000.  The Business Rules Group 26 rev. 1.0Types of Influence
There are two general categories of Influence, as follows.
•External Influence
•Internal Influence
Figure 12:  Concepts Reflecting Influences
As the names imply, the distinction between the categories is based on whether the Influence
falls outside the organization’s boundary (and hence outside its direct control) or inside its
boundary.

Copyright, 2000.  The Business Rules Group 27 rev. 1.0External Influence
External Influences are those outside an enterprise’s organizational boundaries that can
impact its employment of Means or achievement of Ends.  Variations include the following.
Competitor A rival enterprise in a struggle for advantage over the subject
enterprise.
Customer A role played by an individual or enterprise that is a prospect, or
has ordered, received, or paid for products or services from the
subject enterprise.
Environment The aggregate of surrounding conditions or influences affecting
the existence or development of an enterprise.
Partner An enterprise that shares risks and profit with the subject
enterprise (or is associated with the subject enterprise to share
risks and profit) because this is mutually beneficial.
Regulation A rule or order prescribed by an authority such as a government
body or the management of an enterprise.
Supplier A role played by an individual or enterprise that can furnish or
provide products or services to the subject enterprise.
Technology An influence that is caused by (typically, changing) technology
— that is, the things that technology requires or will not allow to
be done.
This list of External Influences is not necessarily exhaustive.  The enterprise may choose to
add additional types or even introduce its own categorization scheme (i.e., the list above is
totally replaceable).
Also, these types are not necessarily mutually exclusive.  A particular instance of External
Influence actually may be classified as more than one of these types.

Internal Influences are those from within an enterprise that can impact its employment of
Means or achievement of Ends.  Variations include the following.

Corporate Value An ideal, custom, or institution that an enterprise
promotes or agrees with (either positive or negative)...

4.2 Assessing the Impact of Influences on Ends and Means
Influences are neutral — they are more or less simply just "there" until someone makes an
Assessment of about them as they relate to Ends and Means.  Such an Assessment
represents a judgment about  an Influence with respect to its impact on Ends and Means.
Specifically, the Assessment indicates that the Influence affects the employment of Means,
or the achievement of Ends, in certain ways.
Figure 13:  Concepts for Assessments of Influences on Ends and Means
If an Assessment is connected both to an Element of Guidance and a Desired Result (via their
respective relationships for "expresses the impact of influences on" ) then this suggests that

Copyright, 2000.  The Business Rules Group 30 rev. 1.0particular Element of Guidance is somehow related to that particular Desired Result.  If the
Element of Guidance is not already connected to the Desired Result (via "supports the
achievement of" ) then careful consideration should be given to that omission.
Assessment
An Assessment is a judgment about  some Influence that affects the organization’s ability to
employ its Means or achieve its Ends.  In other words, an Assessment expresses a logical
connection (i.e., Fact) between Influences and the Ends and Means of the business plans.  In
this way, an Assessment indicates which Influences are relevant to which Ends and Means.
Clearly, different people might make different Assessments of the very same Influences on
the very same Ends and Means — and perhaps even the same person at different points in
time.  It is very important to know which person makes which Assessment of an Influence at
which point in time.  In making Assessments, it is useful to document who makes  the
Assessment and at what point in time, so that an audit trail exists for future reference.  This,
of course, cannot always be mandated.
After an Assessment has been made, it can provide the impetus for  the Business Policies that
govern the Means and Ends.  In fact, an Influence may lead to the creation of a Business
Policy only through an Assessment having been made.
Figure 14:  Assessment and Business Policy
This has the following implications.  If it seems that a Business Rule can be derived directly
from a statement, then the statement is more likely to be a Business Policy than an Influence.
This is because Influences are always neutral in and of themselves, and must be assessed to
determine implications for the business plans.  For example, consider the statement "The
company color is blue."  This leads directly to the Business Rule:  "Each web site screen
Organizing Business Plans                       The Standard Model for Business Rule Motivation
                                                                                                                                                     
Copyright, 2000.  The Business Rules Group 31 rev. 1.0must contain the company color blue."  No Assessment needs to be made.  Therefore, the
statement is a Business Policy rather than an Influence.
Types of Assessment
Assessment concepts come in the following varieties:
•Strength
•Weakness
•Opportunity
•Threat
Figure 15:  Types of Assessment
Strength
This type of Assessment indicates some advantage or area of excellence within the enterprise
that can impact its employment of Means or achievement of Ends.  For example,  the
Resource Quality of EU-Rent’s branch managers is assessed to be a Strength for its Tactic:
"Build branch networks outward from business centers."
Weakness
This type of Assessment indicates some area of inadequacy within the enterprise that can
impact its employment of Means or achievement of Ends.  For example, the age and mix of
EU-Rent’s Technology and Infrastructure is assessed to be a Weakness in its Strategy:
"Promote EU-Rent in the market as the car rental company for business users."
Opportunity
This type of Assessment indicates that some Influence can have a favorable impact on the
organization’s employment of Means or achievement of Ends.  For example, the bankruptcy
of Pizza Company’s major competitor in Region-Y is assessed to be an Opportunity in its
Goal:  "To increase market share."
Threat
This type of Assessment indicates that some Influence can have an unfavorable impact on the
organization’s employment of Means or achievement of Ends.  For example, the
Environmental Influence that anti-car political groups are active in country-A has been
assessed to be a Threat to EU-Rent’s Objective:  "By year-end, be number 3 in country-A."

Copyright, 2000.  The Business Rules Group 32 rev. 1.0Impact Value
An Assessment records judgments about the impact (or potential for impact) of some
Influence on Ends and Means in terms of Impact Values.  In other words, an Assessment's
impact is evaluated in terms of  its Impact Values.  Each Impact Value is an evaluation that
quantifies or qualifies some aspect of an Assessment in specific terms, types, or dimensions.
In this way, it is one  characteristic of  the Assessment.
Figure 16:  Assessment and Impact Values
Types of Impact Value
Impact Value concepts come in two varieties, as follows.
•Risk
•Potential Reward
Risks are typically regarded to be negative impacts, whereas Rewards are considered positive.
Where there is more than one Assessment associated with a single instance of an End or
Means, the total impact should be evaluated to uncover tradeoffs between Risks and
Potential Rewards.  This is the basis of risk/benefit analysis.
Risk
A Risk is a type of Impact Value that indicates the impact and probability of loss.  Some
Risks are expressible as formulae of the type:
•Probability of loss. (e.g., 5% probability)
•Potential loss. (e.g., $500,000 loss)
•Unit-of-measure. (e.g., loss in USD)
For example, EU-Rent’s assessed Weakness is judged to represent a Risk, quantified in terms
of probability that business users will not find its Strategy credible.  EU-Rent’s assessed
Threat is judged to represent a Risk, quantified in terms of potential loss of vehicle rental
days from damage by anti-car activists.

A Potential Reward is a type of Impact Value that indicates the impact and probability of
gain.  Some Potential Rewards are expressible as formulae of the type:
•Probability of gain. (e.g., 30% probability)
•Potential gain. (e.g., $40,000 gain)
•Unit-of-measure. (e.g., gain in USD)
For example, EU-Rent’s assessed Strength is judged to offer a Potential Reward of increased
ease of staff recruitment when a new branch is opened.  EU-Rent’s assessed Opportunity is
judged to offer a Potential Reward that it can reach its Goal faster.  On the other hand, this
same Opportunity is judged to represent a Risk because EU-Rent could fail for the same
reasons that drove its competitor into bankruptcy.

Copyright, 2000.  The Business Rules Group 34 rev. 1.05. The Business Rule Motivation Model in Context
John Zachman has provided a useful context for discussing the architecture of an enterprise.
His ‘Framework for Enterprise Architecture’ is a matrix that describes the various ways the
stakeholders of an enterprise view the business and its systems.7  It characterizes architecture
in terms of the perspectives of the different stakeholders (represented by rows in the matrix)
and focuses on the different aspects of architecture (represented by the columns).  The rows
represent, successively, the Planner , Owner , Designer , Builder , and Subcontractor
perspectives.  The columns reflect the abstractions dealing with the aspects of Data , Process ,
Location , Role, Timing , and Motivation  (What, How, Where, Who, When, and Why).
Continuing the approach used in the first document, the Group once again has used the
Zachman Framework as a context for organizing our work.  The material presented in this
document addresses the sixth aspect (i.e., the Motivation  or "Why" column) from the
business Owner’s  perspective (i.e., row two ).8  In other words, the domain of the current
effort is specifically the description of the motivation-related aspects of the enterprise
business system.  Our positioning in row two  means that when we speak of Business Rules  in
this document we are describing elements involved in the definition and operation of the
business — not its information systems or its technology.
5.1 Relationship to Other Aspects of the Business Model
The Group started with Zachman's "Why" column making the assertion that if an enterprise
imposes a Business Rule, it ought to be able to say "why"— it ought to able to state the
motivation .  But, as acknowledged at the beginning of this paper, motivation is just one
aspect of a complete business model.  So, while every effort was made to constrain the scope
to this single abstraction, in some cases it was necessary to make selective reference to
elements of other abstractions — specifically, to concepts of the "Who"  column.
The "Who" Connections
It is difficult to avoid references to "Who" in discussions of "Why."  Generally, it is not
adequate to say "the motivation is that the company wants it that way."  This leads to the
perpetuation of unnecessary rules — unnecessary either because the business requirement for
them has passed, or because they were not Business Rules in the first place (e.g., they were
imposed as workarounds in systems that did not fully support business needs).
Therefore, the Group felt it essential to be able to pin down the motivation more precisely.
This led us to the need to document those parties who play some of the key roles with
respect to motivation .  It only makes sense, after all, that if you cannot find some responsible
party you should be challenging the rules.

Journal , Vol. 26, No. 3, 1987.

motivation  columns) from the Designer’s  perspective (that is, row three ).

Copyright, 2000.  The Business Rules Group 35 rev. 1.0This is reflected in the Business Rule Motivation Model by linking elements of the business
plans to specific parts of the organization (i.e., its Organization Units).  This has been done
where the connection is important for developing, analyzing, challenging, and maintaining the
business plans.
These logical connections (i.e., Facts) include the following:
•An Organization Unit defines Ends.
•An Organization Unit establishes Means.
•An Organization Unit recognizes Influences.
•An Organization Unit makes Assessments.
Figure 17:  Organization Unit Roles
But, it is emphasized that the Organization Unit concept itself does not fall within the scope
of the Business Rule Motivation Model; that concept remains a part of the "Who" aspect of
the business model.  For now, the following provisional definition for Organization Unit is
offered:  "An Organization Unit is any named group of people within the enterprise with a
purpose and a budget."
Because this concept falls outside the scope of this paper, it should be treated as a
placeholder  for future development.  The Group fully expects the above facts to evolve as

Copyright, 2000.  The Business Rules Group 36 rev. 1.05.2 Additional Aspects of the Business Model
Other aspects and additional connections are beginning to emerge as areas of interest for
future work.  For example, there is the "Where" aspect — the application of rules in different
places (including differences that need to be accommodated in globalization of the enterprise).
Another is the management of rules over time.
To expand on the "being-doing" relationships between Ends and Means, the "How" column
needs to be considered.  Furthermore, many of the Business Rules refer to the "What"
column; in EU-Rent, these would be the cars, customers, rental branches, servicing facilities,
etc. — all things important to the business perspective.
These are not independent areas of study.  Workflow to accomplish the same Ends may be
different in different types of location.  Management of rules over time is important to
performance assessment and improvement, but it also addresses other issues as well, such as
response to changes in Influences.  The Group anticipates continuing to find the Zachman
Framework useful in defining and managing this work.
5.3 The Metrics of the Business Model
Implicit in many areas of the model is the subject of metrics.  In almost all organizations there
are "things of interest" that are heavily measured and tracked.  These metrics govern, control,
and influence a wide range of important aspects of the organization.  The very fact these
"things" are so heavily measured makes them important.
Some of the most important metrics of an enterprise are established by the Goals of the
enterprise.  Each Goal can have one or more measures of performance .  For example, a metric
of the Goal:  "To be profitable" is the measure of performance "annual net revenue."  Another
measure of performance of this Goal might be "monthly net revenue."
The example Goals presented earlier have been extended to illustrate measures of
performance:
Goal Measure(s) of Performance
EU-Rent To provide industry-leading customer
service.market share
EU-Rent To provide well-maintained cars. quality of product
EU-Rent To have vehicles available for rental when
and where customers expect them.usage %

Copyright, 2000.  The Business Rules Group 37 rev. 1.0Objectives should always be measurable.  Therefore Objectives, by definition, will have
metrics.  The metrics for an Objective are established by the measures of performance of the
Goal that the Objective quantifies.  To be able to do this, an appropriate unit-of-measure for
the metric must be determined for each Objective.  The Objective then expresses the target
value that the metric should attain in the timeframe specified.  In that way, while a Goal sets
the direction, its corresponding Objectives set the milestones to be attained in pursuing the
Goal.  For example, to quantify the Goal:  " To be profitable" the enterprise might set one
Objective to have a monthly net revenue of at least $5 million (by a specified date) and
another Objective to have an annual net revenue of at least $100 million (by a specified date).
Metrics are imperative for Impact Values.  Without thoughtful and careful identification of
appropriate metrics, the Risk/Potential Reward evaluation becomes meaningless.
If a metric is particularly important, it may attain a special status and be called a Key
Performance Indicator  (KPI) or a Critical Success Factor  (CSF) — or something else.  The
exact terms of identification are not the important issue.  What is important is that the
enterprise will decide on many different things to be measured.  In fact, if the Zachman
Framework is used, it is possible to identify important "things" to be measured in virtually
every cell.  Each of these measurements will have differing degrees of importance relative to
the attainment of some Objective or set of Objectives.  The fact that the enterprise has
decided to measure, evaluate, and act on the results of the metrics is what is important.

Assessment
is a judgment that an Influence affects the employment of Means or the achievement of
Ends.
Types of Assessment include:
•Strength
•Weakness
•Opportunity
•Threat
An Assessment ...
•expresses a logical connection between Influences and the Ends and Means of the
business plans.  Specifically, it ...
-expresses the impact of Influences on Ends and/or Means.
-is a judgment about Influences.
•provides impetus for Business Policies.
•is evaluated in terms of Impact Values.
•must be made by at least one Organization Unit.
Additional constraints:
•If an Assessment is related to both a Means and an End, those End and Means
must be related to each other.
Assumption
is an Internal Influence that is taken for granted or without proof.
Business Policy
is an Element of Guidance that is a statement (or set of statements) whose purpose is to
guide the enterprise.
Compared to a Business Rule, a Business Policy tends to be:
•less structured.
•less discrete or not atomic.
•less carefully expressed in terms of standard vocabulary.
Its formulation is under the enterprise's control by a party authorized to manage, control,
or regulate an enterprise, by selection from alternatives in response to a combination of
Assessments.
A Business Policy ...
•is the basis for Business Rules.
•is motivated by Assessments.
•may be composed of other Business Policies.
•may be part of other Business Policies.

Copyright, 2000.  The Business Rules Group B-2 rev. 1.0Business Rule
a directive, intended to influence or guide business behavior, in support of Business
Policy that has been formulated in response to an Opportunity, Threat, Strength, or
Weakness.
It is a single Element of Guidance that does not require additional interpretation to
undertake Strategies or Tactics.
A Business Rule is:
•highly structured.
•discrete or atomic.
•carefully expressed in terms of standard vocabulary.
A Business Rule ...
•is derived from Business Policy.
•may relate to other Business Rules.
•may be related to by other Business Rules.
Business Rules may be related to each other in the following ways:
•duplicates (might duplicate)
•establishes enforcement scope for (extends)
•exception to
•in conflict with
•interpreted from
•replacement for
•replicates
•semantically equivalent to
•similar to
•subsumes
•supports
•etc.
This paper examines Business Rule from a business  perspective (i.e., the Owner’s
perspective -- row 2 in the Zachman Framework).  This definition reflects that
perspective.  The Group’s earlier paper examined Business Rule from an information
system  perspective (i.e., the Designer’s perspective – row 3 in the Zachman Framework).
The definition stated there reflects that perspective.  The Group maintains that both
definitions are necessary and useful -- and that there is no inconsistency between them.
