 Business Development Capability Maturity Model (Version 1.0) 
©2003-200 Business Development Institute International. All Rights Reserved   Page vii Preface 
The BD-CMM is designed to guide BD  organizations in selecting high-
priority improvement actions based on th e maturity of their current practices. 
Its benefit is in narrowing the scope of improvement activities to those key 
practices that provide the next foundational level for extending the 
organization’s current BD capabilities. 
Why is the BD-CMM Needed? 
The fundamental value proposition unde rpinning the model is that greater 
process maturity is linked directly to improved results in terms of an 
organization’s ability to predictably capture business and achieve high return 
on its investment in business development. As a result: 
• Organizations that establish a strate gy that supports BD adaptability 
and innovation as strategic values ar e able to drive customer-oriented 
solutions.  
• Organizational performance can be improved by sharing and reflecting 
on improvement efforts under way and integrating the perspectives of 
all those associated with business development in the enterprise.  
• Competencies in business development, when extended across the 
enterprise and management responses , can be continuously adapted to 
meet the ever-changing need s of a BD environment. 
The BD-CMM is not envisioned spec ifically as a method for process 
certification, nor does it serve as a quick  fix for those organizations that may 
have processes or projects that ar e “in trouble.” Its framework provides a 
characterization for each level of matur ity in business development and also 
establishes definitions of the improvements required to move to the next, higher level. In this way, the model hi ghlights key elements of a specific facet 
of business development and identifies key practices that need improvement 
to elevate the organization’s maturity ra nking in that specific facet of business 
development. 
Why was the CMM Approach Selected? 
The CMM approach was selected in preference to other process 
improvement methodologies for two primary reasons. 
First, most competing methodolog ies focus on how to analyze and 
understand processes within specific orga nizations and do not try to identify 
specific industry standards by whic h processes can be improved with 
predictable results. By comparison, CMMs attempt to define industry By concentrating on a 
focused set of practices and 
working aggressively to implement and institutionalize them, organizations can make lasting gains in their 
performance and 
competitiveness. 
Business Development Capability Maturity Model (Version 1.0)  
Page viii ©2003-2007 Business Development Institute International. All Rights Reserved practices that correlate with increasi ng levels of process maturity. The 
resulting CMMs seek to provide (a) an  industry standard or “framework” by 
which relative maturity can be assessed, (b) a clear path to evolve processes to 
achieve increasingly mature states, and (c) specific guidance on best practices 
and their applicability  and implementation. 
Second, the CMM approach was chosen because of the level of industry 
acceptance of this model as a preferre d approach to communicating process 
improvement within a “best practices” context. Currently, CMMs are widely 
accepted for software development, systems engineering, project management, and human resources, and industry literature validates that 
companies who apply these approaches derive specific process-driven benefits.  
This combined focus on industry sta ndards and industry acceptance of the 
CMM approach made it especially appr opriate for business development and 
proposal professionals. Ve rsion 1.0 of the BD-CMM follows the structure for 
CMMs pioneered by the Software Engine ering Institute (SEI) at Carnegie 
Mellon University in 1986, with the development of a software process 
maturity foundation. The Department of  Defense (DoD) funded the SEI to 
develop a yardstick for evaluating contractor software development 
capabilities. Not only was the model to be important as a measuring device, the goal of DoD was to improve the ability  of contractor orga nizations to meet 
goals for cost, schedule, func tionality and product quality. 
The Software Capability Maturity M odel (SW-CMM) resulted from this 
original activity. The SW-CMM has si nce undergone several revisions and 
spun off a Systems Engineering CMM (SE-CMM), Software Acquisition CMM (SA-CMM), People CMM, and Integr ated Capability Maturity Model 
(CMMI). 
Since initial application of the SW -CMM as an evaluation tool for the 
Government, measurements of process maturity have been performed by trained evaluators conducting Software Capability Evaluations to qualify contractors for software developm ent work. Resulting industry data 
established that using the model has significantly benefitted both the Government and industry in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency, and 
industry has realized notable return on investment from improving their 
processes. 
Over time, contractors have begun se lf-assessment on a project-by-project 
basis in order to determine potential areas of improvement. They have also 
engaged organizations such as the Software Productivity Consortium to perform audits and assessments, whose resu lts have become an integral part of 
company marketing materials. The SEI CMM began as a 
tool to improve the outcome 
of Department of Defense software development projects. 
The Software CMM has 
inspired models for other 
key organizational functions affecting the outcome of DoD programs. 
 Business Development Capability Maturity Model (Version 1.0) 
©2003-200 Business Development Institute International. All Rights Reserved   Page ix Thus, it has become apparent that  the CMM approach has added a 
significant level of professionalism to  the processes to which it has been 
applied. In addition, there has been a notable level of industry acceptance of 
the approach in promoting process imp rovements that have benefitted both 
process users and corporate stakehol ders. By applying the approach to 
business development, then, we seek broader acceptance of business development excellence as a meaningful endeavor. 
What Background, Benchmarking, and Prior Studies 
Support the BD-CMM? 
As highlighted in figure i, a numbe r of industry studies have been 
conducted that showed the necessity  for a BD-CMM. Beginning in 1993, 
Coopers and Lybrand reported data at  the APMP Annual Conference that 
established industry baselines  for “best-in-class” BD characteristics. This was 
followed at the 1995 APMP Annual Conference by a report from a Price Waterhouse study that led to the publicat ion of best practices from capture 
planning to award. In 1996, APMP c onducted a salary and compensation 
study, followed in 1998 by an APMP-sponsored study of bid and proposal (B&P) effectiveness. 
In 2002, Shipley conducted an 
expansive industry benchmarking study on behalf of the APMP, known as APMP Benchmark Study 2002. This year-long effort created an updated and expanded database of industry metrics through which to identify BD best practices across the wide spectrum of businesses, industries, and marketplaces represented by the APMP membership. Specifically, the study goals were to: 
• Revisit APMP 
organizational 
demographics, metrics, and best practices from prior studies 
• Perform first-time comparisons of  Government versus Business-to-
Business and International data on member companies 
• Beta-test the ability of the draft BD-CMM to assess process maturity 
and identify improvement oppor tunities at Levels 2 and 3 
• Gain feedback on the applicability  of BD-CMM Levels 2 and 3 to 
member companies’ process maturity 1993 94 95 96 97 98 99 00 2001Data collection to establish

Page x ©2003-2007 Business Development Institute International. All Rights Reserved APMP Benchmark Study 2002 focused on (a) business development from 
opportunity identification through contract  award; (b) the establishment of 
industry baselines categorized by govern ment, commercial, and international; 
(c) the identification of key practices that  are applicable now and in the future; 
and (d) the collection of metrics that  are industry standa rds and represent 
common and unique best practices. 
By the time the study was completed, 62 companies/operating units 
participated. This represented a surv ey sample size capable of providing 
statistically significant correlations  between performance metrics and 
appropriate best-in- class standards. 
Who is the BD-CMM’s intended audience? 
The BD-CMM is relevant for anyone involved at the front end of the 
business cycle, where an organization’s st rategic direction is  defined, presence 
in the marketplace is established, and existing or prospective customers are 
engaged to procure the organization’ s offerings. However, the model is 
especially targeted at those who are responsible to develop opportunities, 
manage BD/sales and marketing activ ities, implement BD practices, and 
assure continuing growth and viability in the organization’s marketplace(s). 
The BD-CMM offers special value to organizations that are experiencing 
critical changes, whether these are the result of downsizing, mergers, 
acquisitions, rapid growth, or major tr ansitions in strategic direction. In 
addition, it is useful to managers who want to guide their organizations and 
personnel in industry best practices in business deve lopment, as well as to 
those attempting to underst and the capability and maturity of their BD 
operations. 
How is this document organized? 
This document is organized into six chapters, which fall into three major 
portions: 
• Chapter 1 provides background, contex t, and guidance for applying the 
BD-CMM. 
• Chapters 2-5 present detailed characte rizations for each of the growth 
levels of the BD-CMM (i.e., Levels 2-5). These descriptions address 
the key process areas that comprise  each level, in cluding extensive 
examples. 
• Chapter 6 describes the future direction envisioned as the model is 
applied to companies throughout the world. 
The framework and 
guidance provided by the 
BD-CMM is for anyone interested in assessing BD capability, planning BD process improvements, and 
optimizing their BD 
performance. In May 2002, early results 
of APMP Benchmark Study 
2002 were presented to the 13
th Annual Conference of 
the APMP in Salt Lake City, UT.

these appendices, the last (Appendix D) is especially important, as it 
consolidates the model into a series  of tables through which progression 
within the model may be more eas ily described, and specific process 
improvements may be more readily planned.

 Business Development Capability Maturity Model (Version 1.0) 
©2003-2007 Business Development Institute International. All Rights Reserved   Page 1 Chapter 1. Overview of the 
CMM® for Business Development 
Maturity, according to the Random House Dictionary, means “full 
development or a perfected condition.” It also suggests understanding as to 
why success occurs and as to ways to prevent common problems. In terms of 
business development (BD), this rela tes to capabilities that can produce 
repeatable success in an organization’s BD initiatives. 
The Business Development Capabili ty Maturity Model (BD-CMM) is 
depicted in figure 1. It cr eates a vision of excellen ce capable of guiding major 
process improvement in business devel opment. It provides its users with a 
framework, path, and guide for achievi ng dramatic process improvement in The BD-CMM was 
developed as a starting point for BD professionals 
to craft a robust outline of 
what promotes optimum performance across the broad range of industry types, sizes, and environments. 
Figure 1. Overview of the CMM for Business Development. Version 1.0 of the BD-CMM addresses critical 
elements of BD capability growth. 
Business Development Capability Maturity Model (Version 1.0)  
Page 2 ©2003-2007 Business Development Institute International. All Rights Reserved their organizations. In addition, it prov ides a process improvement map that 
organizations can use to assess the eff ectiveness and efficiency of their BD 
operations. It is envisioned that the model will promote ongoing discussion 
and development within the BD profession. 
The model's scope encompasses the full BD life cycle and organizational 
components, including advance marketing, sales, sales account management, proposal development, and others enga ged in the BD enterprise. The model 
acknowledges that no one component can ex ist very long in isolation, and that 
success, when realized, is the or chestrated result of teams.  
The BD-CMM has been constructe d based on the existing Carnegie 
Mellon Software Engineering Insitute (SE I) capability maturi ty principles and 
existing models for software, software  acquisition, systems engineering, and 
human resources (SW-CMM, SA-CMM, SE-CMM, and People CMM). In addition, it acknowledges current efforts for CMM Integration
SM (CMMI®).  
As illustrated in figure 2, development of the BD-CMM has had two main 
focuses – applying lessons learned from earlier CMMs (most notably, the  
SW-CMM and the People CMM) and appl ying candidate best practices from 
prior APMP studies, other industry benchmarking reports, and Shipley 
process consulting experience.  
A major challenge in its development effort was the definition of Key 
Process Areas (KPAs) in a manner that al lows them to be applicable to most 
companies. The APMP partnership provi ded an essential way to get broad 
industry involvement and to assure sens itivity to process issues that are 
meaningful to both large and small enterprises engaged in government, 
business-to-businss (“commercial”), and international pursuits. The Software CMM is the 
most familiar of the models, 
but all CMMs rely on a framework of levels. Progress from level to level is achieved through evolutionary process 
improvements defined for 
each plateau.

Figure 2. BD-CMM Derivation. Version 1.0 of the BD-CMM is derived from the team’s 
analysis of other CMMs to establ ish its structure and from the combination of APMP, industry, 
and Shipley best practices to define its content.  
 Business Development Capability Maturity Model (Version 1.0) 
©2003-2007 Business Development Institute International. All Rights Reserved   Page 3 1.1 What is the Scope of the BD-CMM? 
The BD-CMM defines “levels of ma turity” from one to five, through 
which an organization must pass in order to ultimately achieve a fully 
optimized process. Each level is defined such that multiple areas of process improvement must take place within the level, all falling within the overall characterization, or definition, of that le vel. The definitions for each level are 
very broad, to allow for a wide variet y of organizational types, but clearly 
describe a progression to  increased maturity. 
The BD-CMM defines “business development” in broad terms. It 
incorporates Key Process Categories (KPCs), KPAs, and best practices 
applicable to how companies in dive rse industries and ma rketplaces acquire 
business. It is designed to be applicab le to processes that have traditionally 
been called “business development”  as  well as those trad itionally described 
as “sales and marketing.” The concepts , practices, and strategies embedded 
into the BD-CMM apply equally to op erations that pursue many (often 
thousands) opportunities per year and to  operations targeted to acquire a 
relatively small number of very large,  strategic opportunities (often worth 
billions of dollars over decades). 
1.2 What are the Format and Structure of BD-CMM? 
An integrated view of the BD-CMM is  provided in figure 3 to facilitate 
quick reference. This allows one to qui ckly note the vertical progression to 
higher maturity levels a nd the horizontal activities performed simultaneously 
to improve within a specific level. 
The four major bands represent the four KPCs – i.e., major categories 
deemed appropriate for business development. In comparison, the SW-CMM is organized around three process cate gories (management, organizational, 
and engineering), and the SE-CMM incl udes three process areas (engineering, 
project, and organizational). 
Themes are associated with each KPC and are highlighed in  italics within 
the respective bands. (For example, the theme for the KPC “Customer” is “Increasing Customer Value.”) The them atic definition is modeled after the 
People CMM, which uses a comparable construct (developing capabilities, building teams and culture, motivating and managing performance, and shaping the workforce).  
It is also noteworthy that BD -CMM Version 1.0 adopts the SW-CMM 
nomenclature. The level definitions have been tailored to apply to the BD process, and the KPAs are aligned by KPC and level. For example, the KPA “Individual Skills Development” is seen as an area in which an organization 
should focus to improve its proce ss to achieve Level 2 maturity. BD-CMM Version 1.0 is 
closely patterned after existing CMMs that have 
already demonstrated their 
applicability and efficacy.

Figure 2. Integrated View of the BD-CMM. The BD-CMM articulates the behavioral characteristics of organizations as they mature and highlights the 
impact of increasing maturity on both BD processe s and management visibility within those processes.  
 Business Development Capability Maturity Model (Version 1.0) 
©2003-2007 Business Development Institute International. All Rights Reserved   Page 5 1.2.1 CMM Levels and Definitions  
CMMs for all types of activities esta blish “levels” of maturity through 
which an organization must pass in order to achieve the next level. Each level 
is defined such that multiple areas of  process improvement must take place 
within the level, but each area’s activities fall within the overall characterization, or definition, of that le vel. The definitions for each level are 
very broad, to allow for a wide variety of organizational behaviors, but clearly 
describe a progression of increased maturity. 
The levels of maturity (figure 4) de fine specific goals that are to be 
achieved. The goals are presented as results statements that describe observable milestones to verify whether or not an organization has effectively 
implemented certain processes. As a pr ogressive standard, this framework not 
only provides a characterization for each level but also defines the 
improvements required to m ove to the next level. 
• The Initial level, characterized by ad hoc processes 
and limited management commitment, evolves to the 
Repeatable level through in troduction of discipline to 
an otherwise chaotic process.  
• Once some level of disciplin e is adopted at Level 2, 
repeatability  replaces the chaos of Level 1.  
• Logical evolution from the Repeatable level to the 
Defined level is the establishment of a standard, 
consistent process .  
• The Managed level is reached by a process 
characterized as predictable .  
• The Optimizing level results from a continually 
improving process .  
Presenting the levels of a CMM as a series of plateaus does not necessarily 
reflect equal degrees of improvement. Just as introduction of a disciplined 
process is much less difficult than orga nizational adoption of that process, the 
progress from Level 1 to Level 2 is much more easily accomplished than the progress from Level 2 to Level 3. 
The process improvement required to move to successive levels becomes 
increasingly more difficult to achieve. All organizations go through a maturity 
process, and this process precedes excellence. Accordingly, the learning curve for maturity typically is measured  in years [Kerzner, 2001]. However, 
organizations that do reach higher levels of  maturity and attain some degree of 
excellence, achieve and exploit a sustained, competitive advantage. 5

Figure 4. CMM Maturity Levels. Maturity of

Business Development Capability Maturity Model (Version 1.0)  
Page 6 ©2003-2007 Business Development Institute International. All Rights Reserved What is graciously missing from thes e rankings is the rank of zero, which 
describes an organization that has no pr ocedures, and none of its endeavors is 
ever near the success mark. One hopes that such an organization does not exist, although it is possible for an or ganization to merit a ranking of zero on 
one of the performance attributes. If th is is the case, then the improvement 
plans that usually follow the maturity  assessment will have the development 
of processes and procedures as th e first step [Rad and Levin, 2002]. 
1.2.2 Process Areas, Common Features, and Key Practices  
Maturity levels above Level 1 are composed of several  KPAs, and each 
KPA is organized into five sections called common features . The common 
features contain the key practices  that, when collectively addressed, 
accomplish the goals of the KPA. This is illustrated in figure 5. 
KPAs are specifically associated with the capability being measured. They 
are building blocks that i ndicate what an organizati on should do to improve its 
process. KPAs identify the issues that mu st be addressed to achieve a maturity 
level. 
Within each KPA, the common features represent attributes that indicate 
whether the implementation and institu tionalization of a KPA are effective, Key process areas are 
clusters of related activities that, when performed 
collectively, achieve a set of 
goals considered to be important for establishing process capability.

Figure 5. CMM Structure. Like other CMMs, the BD-CMM is struct ured around KPAs, which have associated key 
practices organized by common features.  
 Business Development Capability Maturity Model (Version 1.0) 
©2003-2007 Business Development Institute International. All Rights Reserved   Page 7 repeatable, and lasting. In this rega rd, the BD-CMM blends the nomenclature 
of the Software and People CMMs, resulting in the following common 
features: 
• Commitment to Perform (pol icy and management support) 
• Ability to Perform (resources, organizational structure, and 
guidance/training) 
• Activities Performed (planning, performing, monitoring, and taking 
corrective action) 
• Measurement (status and effectiv eness of activit ies performed) 
• Verification (revi ews and audits) 
Finally, the key practices provide the infrastructure and activities that 
contribute most to the effective implem entation and institutionalization of a 
KPA. Key practices are intended to co mmunicate principles that apply to a 
wide variety of environments and orga nizations, that are valid across a range 
of applications, and that will remain va lid over time. Thus, the approach is to 
describe the principles and leav e their implementation up to each 
organization, according to its culture and the experiences of the developers. 
Representative key practices from  the BD-CMM are provided in the 
shaded boxes in figure 6.

Business Development Capability Maturity Model (Version 1.0)  
Page 8 ©2003-2007 Business Development Institute International. All Rights Reserved 1.3 How Can the BD-CMM Guide Improvements? 
The BD-CMM provides two levels of guidance for implementing practices 
in an organizational improvement program: 
• Strategy guidance for use in deve loping the organization over time 
• Practical guidance that an organization can use to solve problems or 
shortcomings in its BD activities.  
BD-CMM guidance does not specify exp licit practices to be deployed. It 
sets a framework for selecting and ta iloring practices to the organization’s 
history, culture, and environment.  
The BD-CMM also does not provide guidance on how to implement the 
improvement program itself. It is a ro admap for BD capability growth and can 
be coupled with various methodologie s (e.g., Six Sigma) through which to 
implement actual improvements. 
As embodied in its four KPCs, the BD-CMM’s primary focus is on the 
progression within the overall model.  That is, it provides the specific 
improvement paths needed to maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of a BD organization and related operation within each of the KPCs, as outlined in 
the following paragraphs.  
1.3.1 Customer KPC: The Path to Increasing Customer Value  
The “Customer” KPC focuses on how to increase customer focus in the 
BD organization. It shows the progress ion linking the KPAs across the four 
levels: 
• At Level 2, the “Response Generation” KPA represents a 
cluster of related activities aimed at achieving the ability to 
respond effectively and efficien tly to customer-specified 
requirements. This encompasses responses ranging from sales letters to proposals to  oral presentations or 
demonstrations. 
• At Level 3, “Solution Devel opment” indicates a higher 
maturity level in increasing customer value through 
collaboration with the customer in developing 
requirements and preferred solutions. 
• At Level 4, “Relationship Manage ment” implies an even closer 
working relationship between buyer and seller extending to the seller’s 
understanding of the buyer’s customers. 
• Finally, at Level 5, in the “Innovatio n and Transformation” KPA, the 
emphasis is on partnerships with customers and on assuring seamless zAd Hoc 1. InitialzResponse Generation 2. RepeatablezSolution Development 3. DefinedzRelationship Management 4. ManagedzInnovation/Transformation 5. OptimizingTheme: Increasing

1.3.2 Focus KPC: The Path to Improving Performance and 
Synergy  
The “Focus” KPC addresses how to improve BD performance and 
organizational synergies and is provided  in two parts, a “management thread” 
and a “quality thread.” It shows th e progression linking the KPAs across the 
four levels: 
• At Level 2, the combined management and quality 
threads include two KPAs, “Business Development 
Administration” and “Quali ty Control,” respectively. 
Together, they depict an or ganization that is beginning 
to make its BD activities more systematic by having defined procedures and consis tent decision criteria for 
managing BD activities. Conc urrently, the organization 
is defining initial quality techniques applicable to 
business development and is applying them to BD operations. 
• Going beyond Level 2, the KPAs of the management 
and quality threads become “Organizational Tactics” 
and “Quality Management,” respec tively. This progression reflects 
growth into a leadership role for the BD organization, establishment of 
a BD process group to lend consis tency across the organization, and 
setting up a quality program to iden tify and implement improvements 
on a routine basis. 
• As one looks beyond Level 3, the KPAs of the management and 
quality threads become “Enterprise Influence” and Quantitative 
Process Management.” At this le vel, an organization is actively 
integrating BD strategies with its overall strategic planning processes 
to assure alignment of organizational goals, values, resources, and investment. This includes giving business development a proactive 
leadership role across the enterpri se and embedding BD perspectives 
into the organization’s quantitative process management program. 
• At Level 5, the KPA “Innovation and Transformation” focuses on 
creating and maintaining an organi zational vision th at values and 
rewards continuous improvement and transforms BD operations, while extending quality practices acro ss the enterprise in a dynamic 
environment. zAd Hoc 1. InitialzBD Administration

Page 10 ©2003-2007 Business Development Institute International. All Rights Reserved 1.3.3 People KPC: The Path to Building Competencies and 
Teams  
The “People” KPC seeks to build comp etencies and teams within the BD 
operation. It shows the progression linking the KPAs across the four levels: 
• The focus of organizations at  Level 2 is on “Individual 
Skills Development.” As the organization seeks 
repeatability, it looks to de velop and reward individual 
skills in those area s needed to support BD efforts. Most 
often, this means recognizi ng those individuals who 
perform well on given BD activ ities and leve raging their 
skills on subsequent efforts. 
• As the organization progre sses to Level 3, the focus 
changes to “Organizational Competencies Development.” 
That is, it seeks to build co mpetence into the organization 
rather than simply relying on innately talented individuals, thereby offering career opportunities in business 
development as a key strategy for growing the business. 
• Level 3’s emphasis on competence lays the foundation for Level 4 
capability, as defined in “High-Perfor mance Teams.” At this level, the 
organization uses high-performance t eams as an integral part of its 
overall strategy to support busine ss development across the business 
acquisition life cycle. 
• Then, at Level 5, the KPA “Innovation and Transformation” 
characterizes a learning organization.  In such organizations, people at 
all levels are continually incr easing their capacity to produce 
beneficial BD results as participan ts in an ongoing cycle of adapting 
the BD enterprise to remain viable and competitive. zAd Hoc 1. InitialzIndividual Skills

©2003-2007 Business Development Institute International. All Rights Reserved   Page 11 1.3.4 Capabilities KPC: The Pa th to Enhancing Systems and 
Processes  
The “Capabilities” KPC plots a cour se for enhancing the systems and 
processes that must support BD operati ons. It is provided in two parts, a 
“process thread” and an “infrastructure thread,” that link the KPAs across the 
four levels: 
• The Capabilities KPC has two KPAs at Level 2, 
“Sales/Capture Procedures” and “Work Environment,” 
which comprise the process and infrastructure threads, respectively. At this level,  the organization is focused 
on gaining control of BD  activities by defining 
procedures through which management can be involved at key points in the BD process. Along with this oversight comes the recognition that BD efforts must be 
supported in definitive ways. 
• Moving to Level 3, the process and infrastructure 
threads focus on “Business Development Processes” 
rather than procedures and on “Support Systems” rather than fundamental aspects of the BD wo rk environment. At this level, a 
standard BD process is used acros s the entire organization, yielding 
consistency and managed improvement . There is also strong emphasis 
on establishing and maintaining suitable infrastructure to promote successful BD operations across the business acquisition life cycle. 
• Going beyond Level 3, the process and infrastructure threads at Level 
4 become “BD System Integration” and “Infrastructure Management,” 
respectively. This is embodied in integrated processes and systems 
across all enterprise op erations, supported by a coherent strategy for 
managing and adapting the BD infrastructure for maximum support. 
• Then, at Level 5 the KPA “Innovation and Transformation” translates 
into a culture that emphasizes a process of ongoing optimization of 
both processes and infrastructu re. This represents a dynamic 
environment focused on doing whatever is needed to transform organizational support and encourage flexibility and adaptability. zAd Hoc 1. InitialzSales/Capture Procedures

Page 12 ©2003-2007 Business Development Institute International. All Rights Reserved 1.4 How Can Organizations  Benefit from BD-CMM? 
The benefits of better workforce pr actices have been demonstrated 
empirically in numerous studies [L abor, 1993; Mavrinac, 1995]. Companies 
with the best workforce practices have  been shown to outperform other firms 
in the growth of profits, sale s, earnings, and dividends.  
As an example, SEI CMMs have been shown to provide the following 
benefits: 
• Improve the ability of an organizatio n to meet goals for cost, schedule, 
functionality, and product quality 
• Establish a yardstick against whic h it is possible to judge, in a 
repeatable way, the maturity of an organization’s process and compare 
it to the state of the practice in the industry 
• Improve productivity, quality, and tim e to market [Hersbsleb, 1994] 
• Facilitate planning improvements to processes 
• Improve management visibility into the process 
The BD-CMM focuses on securing the same kind of improvements for 
BD practices within organizations. Be st-in-class attributes, based on the 
APMP Benchmark Study 2002, indicate that  improvements in BD processes 
will lead to: 
• Enhanced effectiveness and efficiency 
• Improved predictability 
• More accurate projections of revenue 
• Increased control 
• More precise understanding of business development costs 
• Improved management visibility into business development 
A good way to illustrate these benefits is to conceptualize how 
management visibility might be improved in the BD process. Immature BD processes typically result in the organizati on (a) being unable to control costs 
associated with pursuing business – a ma jor management issue, and (b) having 
no management mechanisms through whic h to influence th e probability of 
winning key programs.  
• At risk in terms of cost control is  the corporate “bottom line,” which is 
directly affected by the cost of sales.  
Benefits reported from 
the SW-CMM include: 
¾ Return on investment 
of 7:1 
¾ Average gains in 
productivity of 37% per year 
¾ Reduced initial 
defects by 18% per 
year gain in defects 
found in pre-test 
¾ Reduced time to 
market of 19% 
¾ Reductions in filed 
error reports per year of 45% 
Comparable results in 
BD capability would 
mean: 
¾ Dramatically 
improved win rates 
and capture ratios 
¾ Reduced percent 
cost of sales 
¾ Reduced labor costs 
and turnover rates 
¾ Managed growth and 
profitability 
 Business Development Capability Maturity Model (Version 1.0) 
©2003-2007 Business Development Institute International. All Rights Reserved   Page 13 • At risk in terms of ability to influence win probability is the short- 
and/or long-term viability of the business itself.  
Increased management visibility (as part  of overall growth in process maturity 
levels) leads to a proactive posture thr ough which the future of the enterprise 
can be managed for both growth and profitability. 
The most dramatic illustration of the benefit is highlighted in figure 7. 
Companies that invest in their BD capab ility in appropriate ways win more of 
the contracts they pursue (as evidenced in  “win rate”); more importantly, they 
consistently win the high-value, stra tegic programs upon which their long-
term viability is based (as evidenced in “capture ratio”). 
In defining the “path” to higher levels of capabilit y, the four KPCs of the 
BD-CMM define a progressive series of improvement initiatives that lead to higher performance. These initiativ es are embodied in the KPAs and 
summarized in Table 1.

Activities Performed (KPA: I ndividual Skills Development) 
Actions that an organization must take  in this KPA to assure that the 
process is established and will endure involve: 
• The organization identifies critical BD skills and training needs. 
For example, a gap analysis might be conducted so that the 
knowledge, skills, and competencies of  those persons assigned to BD 
initiatives are compared to those required to determine whether 
training is needed. Such methods for evaluating training needs may 
include: 
¾ Individual training needs assessment 
¾ Review of individuals’ previous experience 
¾ Review of performance versus training needs 
¾ Knowledge, skills, and competency assessment tests 
• Individuals and/or groups receive the training they need to perform 
their business development tasks.

Future Directions of the BD-CMM 
Development of the BD-CMM had led to the establishment of a new 
organization, Business Development Instit ute International (BD-Institute) in 
2004. Its mission is to “promote an innovative community of practice in 
business development through appraisals and self-assessment, best practices, 
certifications, education, and benchmarking.” 
The BD-Institute has established a range  of products and services, as well 
as a network of Approved Providers, to support BD-CMM adopters. However, 
with regard to the BD=CMM itself, BD-In stitute is undertaking to manage the 
future growth and development of the model through three major strategies: 
• Expand the base of participation beyond exclusive involvement from 
Shipley Associates and the Asso ciation of Proposal Management 
Professional 
• Integrate more best practices from the business-to-business and 
international marketplaces into future versions of the BD-CMM 
• Build a “Business Development B ody of Knowledge” to increase the 
understanding of specific best practices in BD-CMM and their 
understanding in spec ific organizations 
6.1 What the BD-CMM Does Not Cover 
While the BD-CMM serves as a framework, a path, and a guide for 
process improvements in business devel opment, there are a number of areas 
that it does not cover. 
The BD-CMM does not prescribe how key practices are to be 
implemented.  It describes an organization at  each maturity level without 
identifying specific means for getting there. For example, it may take several years for an organization to move from one  maturity level to the next. It also 
does not advocate any specific technology or tools to use, nor does it suggest 
how to select, hire, motivate, and retain competent people committed to business development excellence. 
Secondly, the BD-CMM is not a process or a process description. 
Actual processes used in an organi zation depend on many factors including 
organizational structure and size. Th e KPAs in the BD-CMM may not map 
one-to-one with the actual  processes used in a specific organization.  Even 
with adoption of the BD-CMM practices, each organization will need to adjust 
them to improve their effectivenes s with an understanding of how the 
practices work in a partic ular business context.   The BD-CMM does not 
prescribe best practices, processes, assessment 
methodologies, or 
implementation requirements. This chapter discusses what 
the BD-CMM does not 
cover and outlines near-term and longer-term activities being undertaken to maximize its applicability 
as the BD continuous 
improvement standard throughout industry. 
Business Development Capability Maturity Model (Version 1.0)  
Page 102 ©2003-2007 Business Development Institute International. All Rights Reserved Further, the BD-CMM does not prescribe an assessment 
methodology. Under the auspices of the BD-Institute, an appraisal 
methodology has been prepared that va lidates that an organization has 
achieved a given maturity level in te rms of BD-CMM criteria. This allows 
appraisal teams to use the BD-CMM to guide them in identifying and prioritizing findings, which then are us ed by the organization’s BD process 
group to plan and implement improvement strategies. 
As a result, professional judgment is critical in using of the BD-CMM. 
Each KPA must be interpreted in light of an organization’s business 
environment and specific circumstances. Th at is, KPAs define  what is to be 
done, but they cannot mandate how the goals should be achieved. Implementation decisions thus are left up to each organization according to its 
culture and the experience of its staff.  For the same reason, the model does not 
stipulate that each organization must have the same definition of roles and responsibilities for its BD staff, nor doe s it imply that a spec ific organizational 
structure is mandatory. 
Finally, the BD-CMM does not specify de tailed guidance as to explicit 
BD practices that must be implemented . Instead, it sets a framework to 
select and tailor practices according to the organization’s history, culture, and 
environment. The BD-CMM is a road map for organizational growth; and 
through the services of the BD-Inst itute, a model for planning and 
implementing improvement programs is available. 
6.2 Near-Term Activities 
The BD-Institute is focusing heavily to expand the base of involvement 
and support for BD-CMM and its adopters in two key areas:  
• Establish alliances with professi onal organizations with relevant 
domain expertise needed to enhance the current BD-CMM and 
articulate an appropriately broa d “Business Development Body of 
Knowledge” 
• Create an Approved Provider Network to offer products and services – 
i.e., training, consulting, technology, and academic education, research 
and development – appropriate for BD-CMM adopters to leverage as 
they implement improvement programs. 
In addition, the BD-Institute is ac tively providing presentations and 
training programs on the BD-CMM at conferences and professional development days around the world. Th ese programs are also being made 
available upon request for delivery  to interested organizations. 
At the same time, the BD-Institute ha s developed an apprasial and self-
assessment tool, BD-Appraise™, for use by BD-CMM adopters through the 
BD-Institute and selected Approved Providers. Organizations can contact the For the near term, the most 
important activities of the  
BD-Institute involve 
expanding the base of industry involvement in the model, developing needed services, and creating an Approved Provider Network 
to assist BD-CMM adopters 
to implement the model. The BD-CMM must be 
interpreted flexibly, especially when applying it 
to smaller organizations or 
unusual circumstances so that unreasonable or needlessly bureaucratic activities are not implemented. 
 Business Development Capability Maturity Model (Version 1.0)

work with the BD-Institute to obtain and be certified in use of the self-assessment tool directly. 
For its full appraisal services, the BD-Institute has de veloped a rigorous 
appraiser training program. This is offered periodical ly for people interested 
in working as appraisers directly for th e BD-Institute or working internally as 
appraisers for their own organizations. 
6.3 Longer-Term Activities 
In the longer term, BD-CMM expects to  be able to help organizations 
compare the maturity of their BD practic es with the state of practice across 
industry. Using the BD-CMM as a benchmark can be done through the BD-Institute’s common repository of data collected on organizations using the 
BD-Appraise™ assessment tool or thr ough maturity appraisals. These data 
then can indicate BD industry trends. 
Another key component of the BD-Ins titute’s longer-term focus is to 
further refine and expand the BD-CMM based on its experience in BD continuous improvement. The BD-CMM will continue to undergo extensive testing through the ongoing BD appraisals  that BD-Institute conducts, as well 
as though continuing industry experi ence in implementing the model’s 
framework and best practices.  
The BD-Institute will maintain config uration control of the BD-CMM and 
will work with adopters, Alliance Part ners, Approved Providers, Certified 
Appraisers, and industry representati ves to develop BD-CMM Version 2.0. 
While all levels of the model may be revised, the emphasis specifically will be 
on Levels 4 and 5, for two major reasons: 
• Less is known at this time about orga nizations at these maturity levels 
• These are primary areas of best pr actice in which the BD profession 
needs to advance and grow 
The practices for these two levels will be refined as the BD-Institute works 
closely with those organizations that are striving to understand and achieve 
Levels 4 and 5. The BD-CMM is a living 
document that will be improved, but it is 
anticipated that Version 1.0 
will remain the baseline until at least 2006. This provides an appropriate and realistic balance between the needs for 
stability and for continuing 
development. 
Business Development Capability Maturity Model (Version 1.0)  
Page 104 ©2003-2007 Business Development Institute International. All Rights Reserved 6.4 Conclusion 
The BD-CMM is emerging as the continuous improvement standard for 
business development. However, continuous improvement also applies to the BD-CMM and its associated practices. Th e potential impact of changes to the 
BD-CMM on the BD community must be carefully considered, so that the 
BD-CMM, the BD-Institute, and products  and services for BD-CMM adopters 
will continue to evolve as experience and expertise grow. The BD-Institute will work closely with adopters, Al liance Partners, Approved Providers, 
Certified Appraisers, government, indus try, and academia in continuing this 
evolution. 
The BD-CMM provides a conceptual  framework for improving business 
development practices in a disc iplined and consistent way.  
• It does not guarantee that all BD initi atives will be successful or that 
all problems will be resolved adequately.  
• It identifies practices for a ma ture BD capability and provides 
examples to assist in recognizing key components to consider, but it is not meant to be exhaustive, dictatorial, or bureaucratic.  
The BD-CMM will continue to inform and refine the characteristics of an 
effective and efficient BD capability. However, only maturing organizations 
can address all issues that are essent ial to their ultimately optimizing their 
capability and assuring their leader ship through continuous innovation and 
transformation. 
 As the emerging standard 
for BD continuous improvement, the BD-CMM must balance the need for 
stability and evolution of its 
framework, path, and guidance.
