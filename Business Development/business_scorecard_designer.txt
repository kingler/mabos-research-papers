Select an indicator that will be a container for a new KPI. Use "Add..." button on the toolbar to create a new indicator. The software will show
several options:
New item
 - create a new goal or a new indicator with data entered manually, 
via Excel
, or via formula.
New imported indicator
 - create indicator linked to another indicator
New WebSQL indicator
 - create indicator that is powered by external 
SQL data source
The Properties of an Indicator
Select any indicator in the list of KPIs. The software will display properties of the indicator below.
12 / 42
General
 tab:
Name.
 The name of the KPI. Try to keep it short and meaningful, don't overload it with details, and put the details into the
description field.
Icon.
 Next to the "Name" field there is KPI's icon. You can change it by clicking on the icon image.
Description. 
The description field is for additional information about the KPI; it might be information about the measurement
method.
Measure.
 Use this list to choose one of measurement units that is applicable to the KPI. If there is no measure that fits your needs
click the button on the right from the "Measure" drop list to add a new measure.
Data
 tab:
Value.
 The value field displays the current value of the KPI for the date selected in the calendar. The button next to the "Value"
field allows to create indicators with custom formulas.
Max
 and 
Min
 values determine the minimum and maximum possible range for a value. Whereas 
baseline
 and 
target
 values show
your working interval. Normally a baseline is a starting value and the target is a value that you wish to achieve.
Simple input mode.
 For some indicators the Baseline is always equal to Min value and the Target is always equal to Max value.
Check this checkbox and the software will show only the baseline and target fields.
Performance
 tab:
Weight. 
The relative weight of the indicator shows how this indicator is important compared to other indicators in the same
container. The weight is taken into account when the performance of the container is calculated.
Optimization. 
What do you want to do with the value of a KPI? Would you like to minimize it (for example like a turnover of
employees in a company) or you'd like to maximize it (for example profit value). Choose the appropriate optimization. If the
dependency is not as simple as just a line function, you can enter a custom formula into BSC Designer Online that the program will
use to calculate your performance and progress. To do this click on the "Edit" button next to the "Optimization" drop list.
Raw data indicator.
 Some indicators on the scorecard are just data storages that are not supposed to have a performance or a
progress. Check this checkbox and BSC Designer won't take this indicator into account when calculating the performance of the
scorecard.
Respectively to the max/min pair the 
performance
 of the KPI is calculated using the formula: Performance = (Value - mn) / (mx - mn).
Respectively to the baselines/target pair the progress of the KPI is calculated: Progress = (Value - Baseline) / (Target - Baseline).
Context
 tab:
Indicator type.
 The type of indicator is defined in the context of its container. 
Lagging
 indicators contribute to the calculation of
higher level items. 
Leading
 indiators are used for local calculations only.
Glyph 1
 and 
Glyph 2.
 Glyph settings for the indicator on the strategy map.

For example: there is a value of 21% for a KPI for September 1. Then user selects September 5th in the calendar.
If the 
inheritance is active
 the software will display 21% as a value for September 5, and will calculate the performance;

Containers for KPIs
Any indicator that contains other indicators inside becomes a "container" in BSC Designer.
Creating Containers
To create a container:
Select an indicator and create a new indicator inside using the "Add..." button on the toolbar. The selected indicator will become a
container.
Drag and drop to place any existing indicator into another indicator, and the target indicator will become a container.
Container Settings
Choose any container indicator to display its properties. Most of the settings will be exactly the same as for the KPI, but there are two
properties specific for a container:
Performance
 - use this property to tell the software how the "Performance" of the container should be calculated.
Value
 - use this property to tell the software how the "Value" of the container should be calculated.
The following options are available for the "Performance:"
Weighted average
 - 
the performance of the container will be calculated as an average of the performance values of the
contained KPIs taking into account their weight.
Average
 - the performance of the container will be calculated as an average of the performance values of the contained KPIs
17 / 42
Max, Min
 - the software will find the max (or min) performance of the contained KPIs and will use it for the performance of the
container
Sum
 - the performance of the container will be calculated as a sum of the performance values of the contained KPIs
Self-standing
 - the performance values of the contained indicators won't be taken into account; the performance of the container
will be calculated using its own value, min, and max values
The following options are available for the "Value":
Weighted average
 - 
the value of the container will be calculated as an average of the values of the contained KPIs taking into
account their weight.
Average
 - the value of the container will be calculated as an average of the values of the contained KPIs
Max, Min
 - the software will find the max (or min) value of the contained KPIs and will use it for the value of the container
Sum
 - the value of the container will be calculated as a sum of the values of the contained KPIs
Self-standing
 - the values of the contained indicators won't be taken into account; the value of the container will be entered
manually by user

Get Your Data into the Balanced Scorecard from Excel Spreadsheet
With BSC Designer Online you can access business information from several data sources, including Excel Spreadsheet and SQL
database.
Import from MS Excel Spreadsheet
1. Go to your account in BSC Designer Online. Open a scorecard where you want to import some data.
2. Go to the "KPIs" tab.
3. Click on a "Tools" menu, select "Import Indicator Values" option.
4. Select "Import from MS Excel document". Optional: reuse previously saved import profiles from the "Load settings from profile:" drop list.
5. Click the "Next" button.
6. Upload MS Excel file or select one uploaded before. You can use this 
example Excel project
.
7. The name of the uploaded file will be displayed, click the "Next" button.
8. BSC Designer reads the file and shows the list of available spreadsheets. Choose a spreadsheet from the list and click the "Next" button.
19 / 42
9. On the next step mark the column that contains values, the column that contains dates, the column that contains target values (if any),
and so on.
10. Click the "Next" button to preview the results.
11. To reuse this import profile later check the "Save settings as ..." check box. Click the "Finish" button to finalize data import.
Troubleshooting
Date is not recognized.
 Dates might be represented in PC using different formats like yyyy-MM-dd (2016-10-23) or dd MMM yy
(23 Oct 16). BSC Designer is able to recognize most formats, but sometimes you might need to specify date format manually. To do
this use the "Date format" drop list. Use one of predefined formats; advanced users might want to define their own format (
format
guidance
).
I'm using import profile and the data is not correct.
 Most likely you have updated the structure of your Excel Spreadsheet, so
BSC Designer cannot recognize columns and rows according to the information saved in a profile. Do a manual import once again
and create a new import profile.
I see data on preview step but I don't see it on KPIs tab.
 If the data was displayed correctly on the "preview" step
 
it means
that BSC Designer has recognized the data and its formats. Make sure that when you are searching for the data on KPIs tab and
that you choose a correct KPI and a correct date in the calendar.
20 / 42
 
Using SQL Database as a Data Source for the Indicators

Automate Expert Surveys with Data Series Function
In some cases, it is hard to get a quantification of a business goal's performance.
For example, it's hard to say if a proposed innovation idea is good enough, and how it compares to the alternatives. In those cases, a
solution is to survey several experts and use the average of their opinions as an estimated value for the indicator. Data Series function in
BSC Designer will help to keep track of such surveys.
