The i nformation contained in this plan is required for IT project s in varying 
degrees. T he actual pla n items re quired are defined speci fically in project 
managem ent policies.  The exact format of the information m ay vary  from the 
template; howe ver, the basic information is required as defined.   
 
This plan template e mphasizes do cumenting only the pertinen t inform ation 
associated with the plan. The blank template for the project plan is provided in 
Appendix B: Templates &  Sample Forms.  
 
The i nform ation ass ociated with the plan  evolves as the project  moves through 
its various stages an d is updated as new informatio n is determin ed abou t the 
project.   
 
The plan do es not require verbose tex tual con tent filled  with boilerplate 
material. Information associa ted with detail ed proce dures for executing s uch 
processes as tech nical development, configuratio n management, and  quality 
assurance should  be documented in the state organizatio ns procedures. For  
exam ple, the configuration managem ent information co ntained i n the plan 
might referen ce a pro cedu res document that defines the specific activ ities an d 
responsibility for each confi guration item .  The proj ect plan only summ arizes 
who is respo nsible for the configu ration  management activ ities, wh at is under 
configu ration co ntrol, and  where th e rep ository will resid e. 
 
The project plan doc uments the project plannin g process and  consists of  the 
following basic tasks:  
 
• Defining the sequence of tasks to be performed.  
• Identifyin g all deliverables as sociated with the project. 
• Defining the dependency relationship between tasks. 
• Estim ating the resources requ ired to perform  each tas k. 
• Sche duling all tasks to be performed. 
• Defining the budget for performing the task s. 
• Defining the org anization  executing the project. 
• Identifying the known project risks. 
• Defining the pro cess en suring quality of th e proj ect product. 
• Defining the process for configuration managem ent.  
• Defining the pro cess sp ecifying  and con trolling requ irements. 
 
 The plan documents and defines the objectives of the project, the a pproach to be

Project Cha rter 
 The project c harter follows t he project summary information . Like the  project 
summary, the project charter information wa s developed during the project 
conception and d efinition phase and  includes a bu siness problem, state ment of  
work, objective, success fact ors, project dependencies, and constraints.  In the 
plan template, th is inform ation is con tained on two pages or in th e following 
two figures.  A sam ple of the completed  inform ation from the tem plate is sh own 
below. 
 
2. Project C harter(Sample ) 
B. Project Char ter: 
Business Pr oblem. 
All projects start with  a busin ess problem/issue to  solve. 
 
Sample  
The lack of a statewide  autom ated plann ing system for s cheduling  transportation  road rep air maintenance r esources  has 
resulted in road  closures, duplicated capital expenditures , and increased staff ov ertime costs. 
Statement of Work (Goal).  
The statemen t should be short an d to the point. I t should not conta in languag e or terminology that might not be und erstood. 
Sample  
Design and prototy pe an automated, dynamic planning s ystem b y Q4, 1997, based  on an SQL datab ase and  GUI fro nt end . 
Based on the pro totype, pilot the system  and complete full implementation  by Q4, 1998 . 
Project Objec tives: 
Provide a brief, concise list of w hat th e project is  to accomplish. 
The project objectives are a detailed version of the statement  of w ork. Taken with  the statement  of work, the objectives 
defin e the bound aries ( scope)  of the project .  The objective stat ement can a lso be seen as a  decomp osition of  the statement  
of work into a set of necessary an d sufficient objective statemen ts, including: 
 Outcome -  Be specific in target ing an obj ective 
 Measurement- Establish a measu rable ind icator( s) of the progress  
 Ownership - Ma ke the object assignable to a  pers on for completio n 
 Timeframe - Sta te what can  realistical ly be done with a vailab le resources 
Sample  
1. Define the plann ing requ irements  for th e system b y Q2, 1997 
2. Define user need s in terms of inp uts and ou tputs b y Q2, 1997 
3. Conduct user  and stakeho lder meetings during  Q1 and Q2 , 1997 
4. Develop the prototy pe and test, with a completion  date of  Q4, 1997 
5. Conduct the p ilot of s ystem with completion  by  Q2, 1998, with  the pilot lastin g at least three mon ths 
6. Com plete s ystem acceptan ce and user do cumentation  by Q3, 199 8 
7. Complete s ystem installatio n at all locations  by Q4, 1998

Project Tra de Off 
Matrix and Status 
Summary Managing a project  requires the bal ancing of three fact ors: reso urce, schedule, 
and sc ope.  These three  factors are i nterrelated, i.e., a chang e in on e of the m 
causes t he others to cha nge as  well.  The project trad e off m atrix shows th e 
relative im portance of each fa ctor: 
• constrained means t he fact or cannot be changed  
• accepted m eans the factor is  som ewhat fle xible to the project 
circum stance 
• improved m eans that the factor can be  adjus ted. 
 
Also  included on this page of the tem plate is  a matrix for project statu s. The 
matrix  re flects whethe r the technical, schedule, an d cost esti mates for each  task 
are behind, on schedule, or ahead of sche dule. Comments are a dded for any 
deviation from the original estimate.  For each project, the unique teams or 
phase sh ould be filled  in th e appropriate categ ory.

Project Organization The project plan should include a description of the organization that defines 
the persons responsible for  the following types of functions: project manager , 
devel opment manager , qual ity assura nce, and configuration managem ent.  A 
project m anager is required for every project.   
 
Many plans may also  include a narrative of key pro ject m ember respon sibilit ies. 
This would include t he persons name, project position, and key 
respon sibilities.   
 
Small projects will requ ire less org anization al definition than larger pro jects, 
but responsibilities sh ould always be defined.
