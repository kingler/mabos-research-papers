#2. THE LONG TAIL BUSINESS MODEL
Long tail business models are about selling less of more. They focus on offering a 
large number of niche products, each of which sells relatively infrequently 
Aggregate sales of niche items can be as lucrative as the traditional model whereby a 
small number of bestsellers account for most revenues.
Long tail business models require low inventory costs and strong platforms to make 
niche content readily available to interested buyers.

#3. MULTI -SIDED PLATFORM BUSINESS MODEL
Multi-sided platforms bring together two or more distinct but 
interdependent groups of customers.
Such platforms are of value to one group of customers only if the other 
groups of customers are also present.
The platform creates value by facilitating interactions between the 
different groups.
A multi -side platform grows in value to the extent that it attracts more 
users, a phenomenon known as the network effect .

#4. FREEMIUM BUSINESS MODEL
In the free business model at least one substantial Customer Segment is 
able to continuously benefit from a free-of-charge offer.
Different patterns make the free offer possible.
Non-paying customers are financed by another part of the business model or 
by another Customer Segment.

#5. OPEN BUSINESS MODEL
Open business models can be used by companies to create and capture 
value by systematically collaborating with outside partners .
This may happen from the “outside -in” by exploiting external ideas within 
the firm, or from the “inside -out” by providing external parties with ideas 
or assets lying idle within the firm.

“Customers –people and companies 
–have “jobs” that arise regularly
and need to get done. They look 
around for a product or service that 
they can “hire” to get the job done.
…
The functional, emotional, and 
social dimensions of the jobs that 
customers need to get done 
constitute the circumstances in 
which they buy. ”
