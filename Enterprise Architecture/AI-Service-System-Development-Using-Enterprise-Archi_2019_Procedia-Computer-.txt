Abstract
In this work, we propose a model of a project to develop an artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) service system used in an oﬃce environment.
Our model is based on enterprise architecture (EA) approach and consists of business layer elements, application layer elements,
and motivation extensions, so that project participants from both business and IT divisions can have the same understanding of the
project. By applying the proposed model to the project analysis results, we show that we can derive actionable insights for project
risk management.

1. Introduction
Many machine-learning-based artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) programming modules, such as text classiﬁcation and
image recognition, have been developed and made available as application programming interfaces (APIs). As a
result, it is now possible to apply AI technologies for practical business uses. When developing a system using these
APIs, developers need not concern themselves with the details of the machine-learning algorithms, but they can use
the module functions by simply preparing the training data required for the machine-learning programming module.In this paper, we consider system development projects using AI technology APIs.
Oﬃces have started to apply AI technologies to support the operators of inquiry services; to answer queries about
business operations, products, or services; or for screening operations using documents containing many types of indi-vidual data. When AI technologies are applied to these business activities, training data on the target business domain

should be collected. In such situations, we need knowledge of or experience in the domain. Therefore, members from
the business division are required to participate in the project.
There are some new features in AI system development projects and many challenges in the requirement, design,
implementation, and test phases. In this research, we focus on the project design phase before starting an AI systemdevelopment project and consider a consensus of the AI system development project between the business and IT
divisions. Common understanding between the business and IT divisions on an IT system is important to maximize
return of IT investment and it is one of challenge of the business–IT alignment. In this research, we consider theconstruction of a model representing AI service system development projects so that all stakeholders from both thebusiness and IT divisions can understand the project from their own perspectives. To easily create such a model in
various application domains, we propose an Enterprise Architecture (EA) based modeling approach. In this modeling
approach, we introduce a view on business goals and try to represent how each development process can contribute
to the project goals. By applying the proposed model to project analysis results, we conﬁrmed whether we can derive
actionable insights eﬀective for project risk management.
The rest of this paper is structured as follows. In Section 2we describe related work. In Section 3, we introduce the
AI service system and describe the research hypothesis of this study. In Section 4, we describe our proposed model
for AI service system development projects. In Section 5, we describe the application of our model to real project
analysis results and try to derive actionable insights by using our model. In Section 6, we summarize the key points
and future work after the discussion.
2. Related Work
In this research, we considered the assessment of a project developing a system using AI-related technologies, such
as machine learning. For this purpose, an architecture for the whole project is needed.
It was noted that an architecture to represent an entire system is needed in a practical project applying Big Data an-
alytics or machine-learning technologies[4], and some architectures for development teams have been proposed[ 3][6].
Although an architecture containing related business elements was proposed[ 5], it does not contain the project goals
and main actors involved in each element in the project. Therefore, it is di ﬃcult to use these architectures for a
discussion on AI service system development projects between business and IT organizations.
Furthermore, there are few studies on the assessment of an AI service system development project itself. In [8],
it was proposed that some system evaluation issues should be solved when realizing prediction algorithms, such as
machine-learning technologies, as a practical social system. In particular, it is important to assess a project by com-bining the business goal, business process, and developed application. However, for AI service system development
projects, such multi-viewpoint evaluation methods have not yet been introduced.
One of the multi-viewpoint evaluation methods for an IT system is business–IT alignment. In enterprise system
management, business–IT alignment is introduced. In business–IT alignment, relations between the business goal,business process, and IT system are deﬁned. Business–IT alignment is used to discuss an IT system between business
and IT organizations to decrease organization uncertainty, improve enterprise agility, and so on [ 19]. Some methods
for constructing a business–IT alignment model by an enterprise architecture (EA) modeling approach and analyzing
it continuously in a company were introduced in[7][12].
To promote the business–IT alignment approach in practice, it is important to prepare generic models for each
application domain or each industry. For example, generic models for business–IT alignment by EA were proposed
in the IT system operation management domain[ 17] and IT system risk management[ 11]. In the health insurance
industry, a business–IT alignment model for an insurance system was proposed and used to discuss the digital trans-
formation of the insurance system[ 2]. However, in these models, information about the business goal or stakeholders
is not represented. It is therefore diﬃcult to discuss an IT system from the higher business-management viewpoint.
In the healthcare industry, a model representing relations between goals for each stakeholder, services, and business
objects was proposed in[18]. In this research, the model was developed by ArchiMate, which is a common EA mod-
eling language. It is expected that this model can be used for business–IT alignment e ﬀectively. In [ 15], alignment
model between business and AI service system is proposed. Through this business AI alignment model, it is shownthat project members from both business and IT divisions can have a common understanding regarding the systemdeveloped in the project.

H. Takeuchi et al. /Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000–000 3
Although the developed system is represented in these business–IT alignment models from the business and ap-
plication viewpoints, the processes representing how the system is developed and who mainly develop the system are
not described. Consequently, we consider it important to develop a project model that includes development activities
for AI service systems.
3. AI Service System and Research Hypothesis
3.1. AI Service System
In this study, we considered a practical AI project in which we developed a system containing AI technologies for
an oﬃce environment. In an o ﬃce, employees conduct various intelligent activities. It is said that there are three types
of human intelligence: analytical intelligence, creative intelligence, and practical intelligence[13]. In our research, we
considered developing a system with analytical intelligence for oﬃces that supports human activities or that can actas a substitute for them.
Analytical intelligence selects the optimal option among predeﬁned ones as the output for given input data[13]. In
an oﬃce, this intelligence is used in daily activities, such as inquiry services for service queries or business assess-
ments based on documents. We can use machine-learning technologies when we realize this intelligence as a softwaresystem. To use machine-learning technology for system development, we need to deﬁne options in the target businessdomain and collect example inputs assumed for each option. A machine-learning model is generated (Training) fromtraining data containing such pairs of options and examples. This model is deployed into a runtime machine learning
engine; the engine obtains input data and provides output data using the model (Prediction). This AI service system is
illustrated in Figure 1.

3.2. Research Hypothesis
In projects developing business systems using advanced technologies, such as Big Data analytics or machine learn-
ing, developers often cannot elicit su ﬃcient requirements for developed systems from users. In such a case, the min-
imum viable product (MVP) is considered a ﬁrst step to prototype a system by implementing the bare minimum of
functions[1]. After that, users use the MVP in their business and validate whether their business can be improved by
the system using new technologies. Through this development-validation step, the developer elicits new requirementsfrom the users and improves the system iteratively. Finally, it will be deployed as a production system when it satisﬁesall the requirements. In this research, we considered a project developing the MVP for a new AI service system usedin an oﬃce and call it the AI service system development project.

In AI service system development projects, members from a business division need to be involved. When applying
machine-learning technologies in the AI service system, we need training data on the target business for the machine-
learning engine. Such training data is usually converted from business data (documents) and requires some human
work by domain experts from the business division. When using machine-learning technologies, we sometimes obtain
a diﬀerent output, even if the input is slightly changed, and we obtain unexpected outputs for some inputs because the
output of these technologies is probabilistic. To improve performance or consider implementing a workaround planfor cases in which we cannot obtain the expected outputs, members from the business division need to participate inthe discussion of these activities.
In AI service system development projects, therefore, it is important that project members from a business division
can understand not only the developed system itself, but also the signiﬁcance of each development process from theirown viewpoint. In addition, project members from the IT division do not have a method to obtain consensus eﬀectively
on the project. In this paper, we propose a generic EA-based development model for AI service system projects. In the
proposed model, we represent elements for the developed application, development process, and project goals withrelations between these elements. By using the proposed model, we conﬁrmed the following:
•Project members can understand their role and main activities, as well as their signiﬁcance.
•Actionable insights for project risk management can be derived from the project analysis results.
4. Proposal
4.1. EA and AI Service System
In this research, we used ArchiMate[ 16] as an EA modeling language. To represent an AI service system, we used
three business concepts and three application concepts deﬁned in ArchiMate, as follows:
•Business service: an explicitly deﬁned exposed business behavior.
•Business process: a sequence of business behaviors achieving a speciﬁc outcome.
•Business object: a concept used within a particular business domain.
•Application service: an explicitly deﬁned exposed application behavior.
•Application component: an encapsulation of application functionality aligned to the implementation structure.
•Data object: data structured for automated processing.
By using concepts, we deﬁned model elements for the AI service system in Table 1. In ArchMate, various relationships
between model elements are deﬁned. In this research, we used the relationships in Table 2. With these elements and
relations, the AI service system is represented in Figure 2
4.2. Model Elements
4.2.1. Actor
In the model, we considered two organizations: the business division and IT division. In the business division, there
are a planning group and practitioners. In the IT division, there are 4 actors: A business analyst, data scientist, data
engineer, and application developer. To apply AI technologies to a real business, data scientists must have deep domain
knowledge[ 10], or business analysts with domain knowledge need to be involved to support the data scientists. In real
projects, IT vendors sometimes have the same role as the IT division and develop an AI system. In such a project, data
scientists familiar with the target business and business analysts with a deep domain knowledge will participated with
the IT vendor. Therefore, in our proposed generic model, we assign business analysts and data scientist to IT division.
4.2.2. Process
In system development projects where we develop an MVP for a business, there are three processes “Value discov-
ery,” “MVP development,” and “Technical and business evaluation” considered in [1]. In the value discovery step, use

cases are developed and required functions are identiﬁed. In the MVP development step, an MVP with the bare mini-
mum functions. After that, by using the MVP, we validate whether the business can be improved by the new system.
On the contrary, in AI service system development projects, it is said that a business goal is divided into AI goals,
and each AI goal is divided into AI engine goals[ 15]. We need two steps to make an AI system available: training
the AI engine and implementing an application using the AI engine. In our research, therefore, we divided the valuediscovery step and the MVP development step into detailed steps, as shown in Table 3.
4.2.3. Goal
In this research, we consider AI service system development projects in which we develop an AI service system
and assess whether the new AI service system provides functions that meet the needs of the users under speciﬁedbusiness conditions. Therefore, the top goal for developing AI service systems based on MVP is that the systemsatisﬁes functionality.
Functionality is further divided into 5 sub-characteristics. These 5 sub-characteristics are deﬁned for general
software systems[ 9] and they have been customized for AI service systems[14]. Using these customized sub-
characteristics, we decompose the top goal into sub-goals. For some sub-goals that represent functionality sub-characteristics, we further decomposed the sub-goals. Finally, we obtain the goal tree for an AI service system devel-opment project. Figure 3shows the goal tree represented by ArchiMate.

By using the model elements introduced above and relations deﬁned in ArchiMate, we derived The model views.
First, we show a view representing the relationships between goals, processes, and actors in Figure 4. From this
“Why-What-Who View,” project participants can understand the following:
•Why should we execute this process?
•Who should lead this process?
Next, we show a view representing the relationships between actors, processes, and applications in Figure 5. From
this “Who-What-How View,” project participants from a business division can easily understand how each process
will be executed.

5. Example and Discussion
In this section, we show the eﬀectiveness of our proposed model. We apply our model to existing project analysis
results and derive actionable insights. First, we apply our model to tips about practical machine learning projects. It is
said that there are nine reasons why machine-learning projects will fail, as follow:1.
1.Asking the wrong question
2.Trying to use it to solve the wrong problem
3.Not having enough data
4.Not having the right data
5.Having too much data
6.Not having the right yardstick
7.Hiring the wrong people
8.Using the wrong tools
9.Not having the right model
Among these, issues 1–7 are related to project management. From the “Why-What-Who Model View,” it is found
that data scientists should be involved in the project ’s early stages and discuss with the planning group members in
the business division whether the new service can be realized as an AI service. Therefore, from the “Who-What-Howview,” we can skirt issues 1 and 2 by by designing the project so that a solution workshop is held in an early stage.In this workshop, data scientists and business analysts can also discuss what metrics should be used for the AI engine
and AI service with members from business division to assess the eﬀectiveness of the new service. This activity can
solve issue 6. For issues 3, 4, and 5, it is found that we should have a data inventory stage in which members from boththe business and IT divisions participate and assess whether business data required for the AI engine are available. By

 Hironori Takeuchi  et al. / Procedia Computer Science 159 (2019) 923–932 931
H. Takeuchi et al. /Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000–000 9
dividing the project into two phases and deciding at this stage whether the project should proceed, the project manager
need not to assign application developers when the project starts. This means that we can partially avoid issue 7.
Second, we try to apply our model to an analysis result of AI service system development projects. In [ 14], it
is found that for the project to succeed, sub-goals in the goal tree representing the functionality of the AI servicesystem should be discussed between project stakeholders before starting the project. Based on the analysis result of
six projects, the following sub-goals in the goal tree (Figure 3) are highly correlating to the project success[ 14]:
AOther systems using the system output can work even if the system output is not correct.
BA suﬃcient number of examples are provided for each option.
COptions are externalized and electrically available.
DCoverage of the listed options are conﬁrmed by stakeholders.
To satisfy these project success factors, it is important that project members from both the business and IT divisions
have the same understanding of the objective and signiﬁcance of each project work item. From our model views, theproject participants understand who should be involved in each process and what the objective of each process is.For example, on the third and fourth successful factors (C and D), planning group members in the business division
should be involved in the business data inventory activity with data scientists and data engineers from the IT division.
Through this activity, the suitability of the AI service system is conﬁrmed. It is found that we can derive recommended
actions from the project analysis results by using our development model.
From the above examples, we expect that our proposal can be used as a reference model when proposing an AI
service system development project. Furthermore, we can refer to our proposed model when executing a developmentproject. For example, when some issues occur in a development activity, we can use the proposed model to identify
project participants involved in the related activities or estimate the impact of the issue on the project. Investigating
the eﬀectiveness of this use case is one of our future work.
6. Conclusion
In this research, we considered the common understanding of projects developing AI service systems between
business and IT divisions. We proposed an EA-based development model for AI service systems and represented
elements of the developed application, development processes, and project goals with relations in the model.
Our proposed model provided two views, the “Why-What-Who View” and “Who-What-How View.” From these
views, project members can understand the development activities in which they are involved and the impact or
signiﬁcance of each activity on the project. We also applied the proposed model to the existing project analysis results
on AI service system development projects and derived actionable insights into the project risk management, by which
we can solve well-known project issues and satisfy the success factors before starting the project.
From these examples, it is found that we can use the proposed model as a reference model when proposing AI
service system development projects. Furthermore, it is expected that we can use the proposed model during executionof the project. Investigation of such a use case a topic for our future work.
