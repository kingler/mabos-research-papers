## Summary:
"Cloud Architecture Continuity: Change Models and Change Rules for Sustainable Cloud Software Architectures" by Claus Pahl, Pooyan Jamshidi, and Danny Weyns presents an innovative approach to managing cloud software architectures. The paper introduces the concept of cloud architecture continuity, which involves maintaining the validity and satisfaction of system goals amidst changes in architecture. The authors focus on creating change models and change rules to support architecture evolution and adaptation, thus enhancing the technical and economic sustainability of cloud systems. The proposed models and rules are empirically validated through industry consultancy projects and various use cases.
