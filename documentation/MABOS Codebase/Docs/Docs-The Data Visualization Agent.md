# Docs: The Data Visualization Agent

The DataVisualizationAgent provides tools for visualizing data within the user interface. It enhances data analysis and interpretation, improving the MAS's data visualization capabilities. Here is detailed documentation for implementing the Data Visualization Agent, including its role, BDI components, and how it fits into the goal-oriented business development and operation multi-agent system SaaS platform. It includes the requested PlantUML diagrams and a detailed explanation of the Data Visualization Agent's code.

### Role and Purpose:

The Data Visualization Agent is responsible for collecting, processing, and visualizing data within the MAS.

from models.goal_model import Goal
from models.belief_model import Belief
from models.plan_model import Plan

class DataVisualizationAgent(Agent):
    def __init__(self, aid):
        super(DataVisualizationAgent, self).__init__(aid)
        self.beliefs = []
        self.goals = []
        self.plans = []

    def setup(self):
        display_message(self.aid.name, "Setting up DataVisualizationAgent")
        self.add_goal(Goal("VisualizeData", "Maintain"))
        self.add_plan(Plan("PrepareDataPlan", self.prepare_data))
        self.add_plan(Plan("GenerateVisualizationPlan", self.generate_visualization))

    def act(self):
        display_message(self.aid.name, "Acting in DataVisualizationAgent")
        self.execute_plans()

    def on_message(self, message: ACLMessage):
        display_message(self.aid.name, f"Received message: {message.content}")
        if message.performative == ACLMessage.REQUEST:
            self.handle_visualization_request(message)

    def add_goal(self, goal):
        self.goals.append(goal)

    def add_belief(self, belief):
        self.beliefs.append(belief)

    def add_plan(self, plan):
        self.plans.append(plan)

    def execute_plans(self):
        for plan in self.plans:
            if plan.is_applicable(self.beliefs, self.goals):
                plan.execute()

    def prepare_data(self):
        display_message(self.aid.name, "Preparing data for visualization")
        raw_data = self.get_belief("RawData")
        if raw_data:
            prepared_data = self.process_raw_data(raw_data)
            self.add_belief(Belief("PreparedData", prepared_data))

    def generate_visualization(self):
        display_message(self.aid.name, "Generating data visualization")
        prepared_data = self.get_belief("PreparedData")
        if prepared_data:
            visualization = self.create_visualization(prepared_data)
            self.add_belief(Belief("Visualization", visualization))

    def handle_visualization_request(self, message):
        content = message.content
        self.add_belief(Belief("RawData", content))
        self.add_goal(Goal("ProcessVisualizationRequest", "Achieve"))

    def process_raw_data(self, raw_data):
        # Simulated data processing
        return {"ProcessedData": "Cleaned and formatted " + raw_data}

    def create_visualization(self, prepared_data):
        # Simulated visualization creation
        return {"VisualizationType": "BarChart", "Data": prepared_data["ProcessedData"]}

    def get_belief(self, belief_name):
        for belief in self.beliefs:
            if belief.name == belief_name:
                return belief.value
        return None

```

### Implementation Details:

1. **Class Initialization**: The `DataVisualizationAgent` class inherits from the base `Agent` class and initializes its beliefs, goals, and plans.
2. **Setup Method**: The `setup` method initializes the agent by adding the main goal "VisualizeData" and two plans: "PrepareDataPlan" and "GenerateVisualizationPlan".
3. **Act Method**: The `act` method executes the agent's plans.
4. **Message Handling**: The `on_message` method processes incoming messages, specifically handling visualization requests.
5. **Goal Management**: The `add_goal` method adds goals to the agent's list of goals.
6. **Belief Management**: The `add_belief` method adds beliefs to the agent's list of beliefs.
7. **Plan Management**: The `add_plan` method adds plans to the agent's list of plans.
8. **Plan Execution**: The `execute_plans` method executes applicable plans based on the agent's beliefs and goals.
9. **Data Preparation**: The `prepare_data` method processes raw data for visualization and updates the agent's beliefs.
10. **Visualization Generation**: The `generate_visualization` method creates visual representations of the prepared data.
11. **Request Handling**: The `handle_visualization_request` method processes incoming visualization requests.
12. **Data Processing**: The `process_raw_data` method simulates the processing of raw data.
13. **Visualization Creation**: The `create_visualization` method simulates the creation of data visualizations.
14. **Belief Retrieval**: The `get_belief` method retrieves the value of a specified belief.
