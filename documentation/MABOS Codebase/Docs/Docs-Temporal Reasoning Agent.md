### Implementation Details:

1. **Class Initialization**: The `TemporalReasoningAgent` class inherits from the base `Agent` class and initializes its beliefs, goals, and plans.
2. **Setup Method**: The `setup` method initializes the agent by adding the main goal "ManageTemporalConstraints" and three plans: "AnalyzeTemporalDataPlan", "ScheduleActionsPlan", and "MonitorTemporalEventsPlan".
3. **Act Method**: The `act` method executes the agent's plans.
4. **Message Handling**: The `on_message` method processes incoming messages, specifically handling temporal events.
5. **Goal Management**: The `add_goal` method adds goals to the agent's list of goals.
6. **Belief Management**: The `add_belief` method adds beliefs to the agent's list of beliefs.
7. **Plan Management**: The `add_plan` method adds plans to the agent's list of plans.
8. **Plan Execution**: The `execute_plans` method executes applicable plans based on the agent's beliefs and goals.
9. **Temporal Data Analysis**: The `analyze_temporal_data` method collects and analyzes temporal data.
10. **Action Scheduling**: The `schedule_actions` method schedules actions based on the analyzed temporal data.
11. **Temporal Event Monitoring**: The `monitor_temporal_events` method monitors and responds to temporal events.
12. **Temporal Event Handling**: The `handle_temporal_event` method processes incoming temporal event notifications.
13. **Temporal Data Collection**: The `collect_temporal_data` method simulates the collection of temporal data.
14. **Action Schedule Creation**: The `create_action_schedule` method simulates the creation of an action schedule based on temporal data.
15. **Temporal Event Detection**: The `detect_temporal_events` method simulates the detection of temporal events.
16. **Belief Retrieval**: The `get_belief` method retrieves the value of a specified belief.
