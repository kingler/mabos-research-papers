# Docs: Knowledge Graph

## 1. Overall Description and Purpose

This code implements a Knowledge Graph system, which is a powerful tool for representing complex, interconnected information. The implementation is based on the `KnowledgeGraph` class, which utilizes the NetworkX library to create, manipulate, and visualize a directed graph structure.

The purpose of this code is to provide a flexible and extensible framework for building, querying, and visualizing knowledge graphs. It can be used in various applications such as:

- Semantic web applications
- Recommendation systems
- Natural language processing
- Information retrieval systems
- Any domain where complex relationships between entities need to be represented and queried efficiently

## 2. PlantUML Class Diagram

The following PlantUML diagram illustrates the structure of the Knowledge Graph system:

```
@startuml
class KnowledgeGraph {
  - graph: nx.DiGraph
  + add_node(node_id: str, properties: Dict[str, Any])
  + add_edge(from_node: str, to_node: str, relation: str, properties: Dict[str, Any])
  + get_node(node_id: str): Optional[Dict[str, Any]]
  + get_relations(node_id: str): List[Dict[str, Any]]
  + query(start_node: str, relation_path: List[str]): List[str]
  + visualize(output_file: str)
}

## 3. Data Schema Description

The `KnowledgeGraph` class uses a `networkx.DiGraph` object to store the knowledge graph:

- Nodes represent entities and can have associated properties (stored as a dictionary)
- Edges represent relations between entities and can also have associated properties
- The primary property of an edge is the `relation` type

## 4. Breakdown of Functions/Methods

### `__init__(self)`

- Purpose: Initialize a new KnowledgeGraph object
- Parameters: None
- Return value: None
- Key logic: Creates an empty NetworkX DiGraph object

### `add_node(self, node_id: str, properties: Dict[str, Any] = None)`

- Purpose: Add a node to the knowledge graph
- Parameters:
    - `node_id` (str): Unique identifier for the node
    - `properties` (Dict[str, Any], optional): Properties of the node
- Return value: None
- Key logic: Adds a node to the graph with the given ID and properties

### `add_edge(self, from_node: str, to_node: str, relation: str, properties: Dict[str, Any] = None)`

- Purpose: Add an edge (relation) between two nodes in the knowledge graph
- Parameters:
    - `from_node` (str): ID of the source node
    - `to_node` (str): ID of the target node
    - `relation` (str): Type of relation
    - `properties` (Dict[str, Any], optional): Additional properties of the edge
- Return value: None
- Key logic: Adds a directed edge between two nodes with the specified relation and properties

### `get_node(self, node_id: str) -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]`

- Purpose: Retrieve a node's properties from the knowledge graph
- Parameters:
    - `node_id` (str): ID of the node to retrieve
- Return value: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] - The node's properties or None if not found
- Key logic: Returns the properties of the specified node

### `get_relations(self, node_id: str) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]`

- Purpose: Get all relations (edges) for a given node
- Parameters:
    - `node_id` (str): ID of the node to get relations for
- Return value: List[Dict[str, Any]] - List of dictionaries describing the outgoing edges
- Key logic: Retrieves all outgoing edges from the specified node, including their properties

### `query(self, start_node: str, relation_path: List[str]) -> List[str]`

- Purpose: Query the knowledge graph starting from a node and following a path of relations
- Parameters:
    - `start_node` (str): ID of the starting node
    - `relation_path` (List[str]): List of relations to follow
- Return value: List[str] - List of end node IDs that match the query
- Key logic: Traverses the graph following the specified relation path and returns the end nodes

### `visualize(self, output_file: str = "knowledge_graph.png")`

- Purpose: Visualize the knowledge graph and save it as an image
- Parameters:
    - `output_file` (str, optional): Path to save the output image (default: "knowledge_graph.png")
- Return value: None
- Key logic: Uses NetworkX and Matplotlib to create a visual representation of the graph and save it as an image

## 5. Key Python Libraries Used

1. `networkx`: Used for creating and manipulating the graph structure.
2. `matplotlib`: Used for visualizing the graph.
3. `typing`: Used for type hinting, improving code readability and enabling better static type checking.

## 6. Other Class Imports and Their Relationships

This code doesn't import any other custom classes. It relies on the NetworkX library for the core graph functionality.

## 7. Important Notes on Usage, Limitations, and Future Improvements

Usage:

- Create a `KnowledgeGraph` instance to start building your knowledge graph.
- Use `add_node()` to add entities to the graph.
- Use `add_edge()` to create relationships between entities.
- Use `query()` to traverse the graph and find connected entities.
- Use `visualize()` to create a visual representation of the graph.

Limitations:

- The current implementation doesn't support advanced querying capabilities (e.g., complex logical conditions).
- Visualization may become cluttered for large graphs.
- There's no built-in mechanism for persistence (saving/loading the graph).

Potential future improvements:

1. Implement more advanced querying capabilities (e.g., SPARQL-like queries).
2. Add support for node and edge types/classes for more structured knowledge representation.
3. Implement mechanisms for knowledge inference and reasoning.
4. Add support for weighted edges to represent relationship strengths.
5. Implement graph partitioning for handling very large knowledge graphs.
6. Add support for temporal aspects (e.g., time-based relations or node/edge validity periods).
7. Implement a more sophisticated visualization system, possibly with interactive capabilities.
8. Add support for importing/exporting knowledge graphs in standard formats (e.g., RDF, OWL).
9. Implement persistence mechanisms (e.g., database storage).
10. Add support for uncertainty and probabilistic relations.

Example Usage:

```python
kg = KnowledgeGraph()

# Add nodes
kg.add_node("Alice", {"age": 30, "occupation": "Engineer"})
kg.add_node("Bob", {"age": 35, "occupation": "Manager"})
kg.add_node("TechCorp", {"industry": "Technology"})
kg.add_node("ProjectX", {"status": "In Progress"})

# Add relations
kg.add_edge("Alice", "TechCorp", "works_for")
kg.add_edge("Bob", "TechCorp", "works_for")
kg.add_edge("Alice", "ProjectX", "works_on")
kg.add_edge("Bob", "ProjectX", "manages")

# Query the knowledge graph
print("Employees of TechCorp:", kg.query("TechCorp", ["works_for"]))
print("Projects Alice works on:", kg.query("Alice", ["works_on"]))

# Visualize the knowledge graph
kg.visualize()

```

This example demonstrates how to create a simple knowledge graph, add nodes and relations, perform queries, and generate a visualization. It shows the basic usage of the KnowledgeGraph class to represent and query interconnected information.
