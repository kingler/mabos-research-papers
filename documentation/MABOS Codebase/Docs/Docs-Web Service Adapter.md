# Docs: Web Service Adapter

## 1. Overall Description and Purpose

This code implements a Web Service Adapter framework, which provides a standardized way to interact with various web services using asynchronous HTTP requests. The implementation includes two main classes:

1. `WebServiceAdapter`: Encapsulates the logic for making HTTP requests to a specific web service.
2. `WebServiceManager`: Manages multiple `WebServiceAdapter` instances and provides a unified interface for interacting with different web services.

The purpose of this code is to provide a flexible and extensible framework for interacting with multiple web services in an asynchronous manner. It can be used in various applications such as:

- Integrating multiple third-party APIs into a single application
- Building microservices that need to communicate with various external services
- Creating a unified interface for different data sources or services
- Simplifying the process of making HTTP requests in asynchronous Python applications

## 2. PlantUML Class Diagram

The following PlantUML diagram illustrates the structure of the Web Service Adapter:

```
@startuml
class WebServiceAdapter {
  - base_url: str
  - session: Optional[aiohttp.ClientSession]
  + __init__(base_url: str)
  + __aenter__(): WebServiceAdapter
  + __aexit__(exc_type, exc, tb)
  + close()
  + get(endpoint: str, params: Dict[str, Any]): Dict[str, Any]
  + post(endpoint: str, data: Dict[str, Any]): Dict[str, Any]
  + put(endpoint: str, data: Dict[str, Any]): Dict[str, Any]
  + delete(endpoint: str): Dict[str, Any]
}

class WebServiceManager {
  - adapters: Dict[str, WebServiceAdapter]
  + create_adapter(service_name: str, base_url: str)
  + close_all_adapters()
  + call_service(service_name: str, method: str, endpoint: str, data: Dict[str, Any]): Dict[str, Any]
}

## 3. Data Schema Description

1. `WebServiceAdapter`:
    - `base_url` (str): The base URL of the web service
    - `session` (Optional[aiohttp.ClientSession]): The aiohttp session used for making requests
2. `WebServiceManager`:
    - `adapters` (Dict[str, WebServiceAdapter]): A dictionary mapping service names to their respective adapters

## 4. Breakdown of Functions/Methods

### WebServiceAdapter

    - `base_url` (str): The base URL of the web service

- Return value: self
- Key logic: Creates a new aiohttp ClientSession

### `async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc, tb)`

- Purpose: Async context manager exit method

- Return value: None
- Key logic: Calls the close method to clean up resources

### `async def close(self)`

- Purpose: Close the aiohttp session
- Parameters: None
- Return value: None
- Key logic: Closes the session if it exists and sets it to None

### `async def get(self, endpoint: str, params: Dict[str, Any] = None) -> Dict[str, Any]`

- Purpose: Perform a GET request to the web service
- Parameters:
    - `endpoint` (str): The API endpoint
    - `params` (Dict[str, Any], optional): Query parameters
- Return value: Dict[str, Any] - The JSON response from the server
- Key logic: Constructs the URL, sends a GET request, and returns the JSON response

### `async def post(self, endpoint: str, data: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]`

- Purpose: Perform a POST request to the web service
- Parameters:
    - `endpoint` (str): The API endpoint
    - `data` (Dict[str, Any]): The data to be sent in the request body
- Return value: Dict[str, Any] - The JSON response from the server
- Key logic: Constructs the URL, sends a POST request with JSON data, and returns the JSON response

### `async def put(self, endpoint: str, data: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]`

- Purpose: Perform a PUT request to the web service
- Parameters:
    - `endpoint` (str): The API endpoint
    - `data` (Dict[str, Any]): The data to be sent in the request body
- Return value: Dict[str, Any] - The JSON response from the server
- Key logic: Constructs the URL, sends a PUT request with JSON data, and returns the JSON response

### `async def delete(self, endpoint: str) -> Dict[str, Any]`

- Purpose: Perform a DELETE request to the web service
- Parameters:
    - `endpoint` (str): The API endpoint
- Return value: Dict[str, Any] - The JSON response from the server
- Key logic: Constructs the URL, sends a DELETE request, and returns the JSON response

### WebServiceManager

### `async def create_adapter(self, service_name: str, base_url: str)`

- Purpose: Create and initialize a new WebServiceAdapter
- Parameters:
    - `service_name` (str): A unique name for the service
    - `base_url` (str): The base URL of the web service
- Return value: None
- Key logic: Creates a new WebServiceAdapter, initializes it, and stores it in the adapters dictionary

### `async def close_all_adapters(self)`

- Purpose: Close all adapters and clear the adapters dictionary
- Parameters: None
- Return value: None
- Key logic: Iterates through all adapters, closes them, and clears the adapters dictionary

### `async def call_service(self, service_name: str, method: str, endpoint: str, data: Dict[str, Any] = None) -> Dict[str, Any]`

- Purpose: Make a call to a specific web service
- Parameters:
    - `service_name` (str): The name of the service to call
    - `method` (str): The HTTP method to use (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
    - `endpoint` (str): The API endpoint

## 5. Key Python Libraries Used

1. `aiohttp`: Used for making asynchronous HTTP requests.
2. `asyncio`: Used for asynchronous programming and running the example code.
3. `typing`: Used for type hinting, improving code readability and enabling better static type checking.

## 6. Other Class Imports and Their Relationships

This code doesn't import any other custom classes. It relies on the aiohttp library for HTTP functionality.

## 7. Important Notes on Usage, Limitations, and Future Improvements

Usage:

- Create a `WebServiceManager` instance to manage multiple web service connections.
- Use `create_adapter()` to initialize adapters for different web services.
- Use `call_service()` to make requests to specific web services.
- Use `close_all_adapters()` to properly clean up resources when done.

Limitations:

- The current implementation assumes all web services return JSON responses.
- Error handling is minimal and may need to be expanded for production use.
- Authentication mechanisms are not explicitly implemented and would need to be added as needed.

Potential future improvements:

1. Implement more sophisticated error handling and retry mechanisms.
2. Add support for different authentication methods (e.g., OAuth, API keys).
3. Implement request and response logging for debugging purposes.
4. Add support for websockets or server-sent events for real-time communication.
5. Implement request queueing and rate limiting to respect API usage limits.
6. Add support for automatic request retries with exponential backoff.
7. Implement response caching to reduce unnecessary API calls.
8. Add support for custom request/response preprocessing and postprocessing.
9. Implement service discovery mechanisms for dynamic service configuration.
10. Add support for circuit breakers to handle service outages gracefully.

Example Usage:

```python
async def main():
    manager = WebServiceManager()

    # Create adapters for different web services
    await manager.create_adapter("weather_service", "<https://api.weatherapi.com/v1>")
    await manager.create_adapter("news_service", "<https://api.newsapi.org/v2>")

    try:
        # Make calls to different web services
        weather_data = await manager.call_service("weather_service", "GET", "current.json", {"key": "YOUR_API_KEY", "q": "London"})
        print("Weather data:", weather_data)

        news_data = await manager.call_service("news_service", "GET", "top-headlines", {"apiKey": "YOUR_API_KEY", "country": "us"})
        print("News data:", news_data)

    except aiohttp.ClientError as e:
        print(f"An error occurred while calling the web service: {e}")

    finally:
        # Close all adapters
        await manager.close_all_adapters()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())

```

This example demonstrates how to create a WebServiceManager, initialize adapters for different web services, make calls to these services, and properly clean up resources. It shows the basic usage of the Web Service Adapter framework to interact with multiple web services in an asynchronous manner.
