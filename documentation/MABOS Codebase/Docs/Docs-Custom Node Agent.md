# Docs: Custom Node Agent

The CustomNodeAgent manages custom nodes and their behaviors within the user interface. It ensures flexibility and customization options for users, enhancing the MAS's UI customization capabilities. Here is detailed documentation for implementing the Custom Node Agent, including its role, BDI components, and how it fits into the goal-oriented business development and operation multi-agent system SaaS platform. It includes the requested PlantUML diagrams and a detailed explanation of the Custom Node Agent's code.

### Role and Purpose:

The Custom Node Agent is responsible for managing custom nodes and their behaviors within the user interface. It provides flexibility and customization options for users, allowing them to create and modify custom nodes to suit their specific needs. This agent enhances the MAS's UI customization capabilities, making it more adaptable and user-friendly.

### BDI Components:

### a. Beliefs:

- Current state of custom nodes
- User requests for creating or editing custom nodes
- Available node templates and properties
- System constraints and capabilities
- User preferences and customization history

### b. Desires:

- Provide comprehensive tools for managing custom nodes
- Ensure custom nodes are accurate and functional
- Facilitate user interaction and customization processes
- Maintain consistency and integrity of custom nodes
- Adapt to user preferences and requirements

### c. Intentions:

- Create new custom nodes based on user requests
- Edit existing custom nodes to reflect changes or improvements
- Update beliefs with new custom node data

### Detailed Code Explanation:

Here's a detailed explanation of the key components and methods for implementing the Custom Node Agent:

```python
from pade.core.agent import Agent
from pade.acl.messages import ACLMessage
from pade.misc.utility import display_message
from models.goal_model import Goal
from models.belief_model import Belief
from models.plan_model import Plan

class CustomNodeAgent(Agent):
    def __init__(self, aid):
        super(CustomNodeAgent, self).__init__(aid)
        self.beliefs = []
        self.goals = []
        self.plans = []

    def setup(self):
        display_message(self.aid.name, "Setting up CustomNodeAgent")
        self.add_goal(Goal("ManageCustomNodes", "Maintain"))
        self.add_plan(Plan("CreateCustomNodePlan", self.create_custom_node))
        self.add_plan(Plan("EditCustomNodePlan", self.edit_custom_node))

    def act(self):
        display_message(self.aid.name, "Acting in CustomNodeAgent")
        self.execute_plans()

    def on_message(self, message: ACLMessage):
        display_message(self.aid.name, f"Received message: {message.content}")
        if message.performative == ACLMessage.REQUEST:
            self.handle_custom_node_request(message)

    def add_goal(self, goal):
        self.goals.append(goal)

    def add_belief(self, belief):
        self.beliefs.append(belief)

    def add_plan(self, plan):
        self.plans.append(plan)

    def execute_plans(self):
        for plan in self.plans:
            if plan.is_applicable(self.beliefs, self.goals):
                plan.execute()

    def create_custom_node(self):
        display_message(self.aid.name, "Creating custom node")
        # Logic to create a new custom node
        custom_node_data = self.initialize_custom_node()
        self.add_belief(Belief("CustomNodeData", custom_node_data))

    def edit_custom_node(self):
        display_message(self.aid.name, "Editing custom node")
        custom_node_data = self.get_belief("CustomNodeData")
        if custom_node_data:
            updated_custom_node = self.modify_custom_node(custom_node_data)
            self.add_belief(Belief("UpdatedCustomNode", updated_custom_node))

    def handle_custom_node_request(self, message):
        content = message.content
        self.add_belief(Belief("CustomNodeRequest", content))
        self.add_goal(Goal("ProcessCustomNodeRequest", "Achieve"))

    def initialize_custom_node(self):
        # Simulated custom node initialization
        return {"NodeType": "Custom", "Properties": {}}

    def modify_custom_node(self, custom_node_data):
        # Simulated custom node modification
        custom_node_data["Properties"]["NewProperty"] = "Value"
        return custom_node_data

    def get_belief(self, belief_name):
        for belief in self.beliefs:
            if belief.name == belief_name:
                return belief.value
        return None

```

### Implementation Details:

1. **Class Initialization**: The `CustomNodeAgent` class inherits from the base `Agent` class and initializes its beliefs, goals, and plans.
2. **Setup Method**: The `setup` method initializes the agent by adding the main goal "ManageCustomNodes" and two plans: "CreateCustomNodePlan" and "EditCustomNodePlan".
3. **Act Method**: The `act` method executes the agent's plans.
4. **Message Handling**: The `on_message` method processes incoming messages, specifically handling custom node requests.
5. **Goal Management**: The `add_goal` method adds goals to the agent's list of goals.
6. **Belief Management**: The `add_belief` method adds beliefs to the agent's list of beliefs.
7. **Plan Management**: The `add_plan` method adds plans to the agent's list of plans.
8. **Plan Execution**: The `execute_plans` method executes applicable plans based on the agent's beliefs and goals.
9. **Custom Node Creation**: The `create_custom_node` method initializes a new custom node and updates the agent's beliefs.
10. **Custom Node Editing**: The `edit_custom_node` method modifies an existing custom node based on the current beliefs.
11. **Request Handling**: The `handle_custom_node_request` method processes incoming custom node requests.
12. **Custom Node Initialization**: The `initialize_custom_node` method simulates the creation of a new custom node.
13. **Custom Node Modification**: The `modify_custom_node` method simulates the modification of an existing custom node.
14. **Belief Retrieval**: The `get_belief` method retrieves the value of a specified belief.
