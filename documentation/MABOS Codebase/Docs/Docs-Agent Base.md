# Docs: Agent Base

The AgentBase serves as the foundational class for all agents, providing common functionalities and lifecycle management. It ensures consistency and reusability across different agents within the MAS. Here is detailed documentation for implementing the Agent Base, including its role, BDI components, and how it fits into the goal-oriented business development and operation multi-agent system SaaS platform. It includes the requested PlantUML diagrams and a detailed explanation of the Agent Base's code.

### Detailed Code Explanation:

Here's a detailed explanation of the key components and methods for implementing the Agent Base:

```python
from pade.core.agent import Agent
from pade.acl.messages import ACLMessage
from pade.misc.utility import display_message
from models.goal_model import Goal
from models.belief_model import Belief
from models.plan_model import Plan

class AgentBase(Agent):
    def __init__(self, aid):
        super(AgentBase, self).__init__(aid)
        self.beliefs = []
        self.goals = []
        self.plans = []

    def setup(self):
        display_message(self.aid.name, "Setting up AgentBase")
        # Common setup logic for all agents

    def act(self):
        display_message(self.aid.name, "Acting in AgentBase")
        self.execute_plans()

    def on_message(self, message: ACLMessage):
        display_message(self.aid.name, f"Received message: {message.content}")
        self.handle_message(message)

    def add_goal(self, goal):
        self.goals.append(goal)

    def add_belief(self, belief):
        self.beliefs.append(belief)

    def add_plan(self, plan):
        self.plans.append(plan)

    def execute_plans(self):
        for plan in self.plans:
            if plan.is_applicable(self.beliefs, self.goals):
                plan.execute()

    def handle_message(self, message):
        # Common message handling logic for all agents
        display_message(self.aid.name, f"Handling message: {message.content}")
        self.add_belief(Belief("ReceivedMessage", message.content))

```

### Implementation Details:

1. **Class Initialization**: The `AgentBase` class inherits from the base `Agent` class and initializes its beliefs, goals, and plans.
2. **Setup Method**: The `setup` method initializes the agent and sets up initial beliefs and goals. This method can be extended by specific agents to include additional setup logic.
3. **Act Method**: The `act` method executes the agent's plans. This method is called periodically to ensure that the agent's tasks are performed.
4. **Message Handling**: The `on_message` method processes incoming messages. It calls the `handle_message` method to handle the message content.
5. **Goal Management**: The `add_goal` method adds goals to the agent's list of goals.
6. **Belief Management**: The `add_belief` method adds beliefs to the agent's list of beliefs.
7. **Plan Management**: The `add_plan` method adds plans to the agent's list of plans.
8. **Plan Execution**: The `execute_plans` method iterates through the agent's plans and executes those that are applicable based on the current beliefs and goals.
9. **Message Handling Logic**: The `handle_message` method contains common logic for handling messages received by the agent. It updates the agent's beliefs based on the message content.

### Class Definition:

```python
class AgentBase(Agent):
    def __init__(self, aid):
        super(AgentBase, self).__init__(aid)
        self.beliefs = []
        self.goals = []
        self.plans = []

```

The AgentBase class inherits from the PADE framework's Agent class and initializes lists for beliefs, goals, and plans.

### Methods:

### setup()

```python
def setup(self):
    display_message(self.aid.name, "Setting up AgentBase")
    # Common setup logic for all agents

```

This method is called when the agent is initialized. It's intended to be overridden by subclasses to include agent-specific setup logic.

### act()

```python
def act(self):
    display_message(self.aid.name, "Acting in AgentBase")
    self.execute_plans()

```

The act method is the main action cycle of the agent. It executes all applicable plans based on the current beliefs and goals.

### on_message(message: ACLMessage)

```python
def on_message(self, message: ACLMessage):
    display_message(self.aid.name, f"Received message: {message.content}")
    self.handle_message(message)

```

This method is called when the agent receives a message. It logs the received message and calls the handle_message method.

### add_goal(goal)

```python
def add_goal(self, goal):
    self.goals.append(goal)

```

Adds a new goal to the agent's list of goals.

### add_belief(belief)

```python
def add_belief(self, belief):
    self.beliefs.append(belief)

```

Adds a new belief to the agent's list of beliefs.

### add_plan(plan)

```python
def add_plan(self, plan):
    self.plans.append(plan)

```

Adds a new plan to the agent's list of plans.

### execute_plans()

```python
def execute_plans(self):
    for plan in self.plans:
        if plan.is_applicable(self.beliefs, self.goals):
            plan.execute()

```

Iterates through all plans and executes those that are applicable given the current beliefs and goals.

### handle_message(message)

```python
def handle_message(self, message):
    # Common message handling logic for all agents
    display_message(self.aid.name, f"Handling message: {message.content}")
    self.add_belief(Belief("ReceivedMessage", message.content))

```

Handles received messages by logging them and adding them as a belief.

### Usage:

To create a specific agent type, inherit from AgentBase and override or extend its methods as needed:

```python
class SpecificAgent(AgentBase):
    def setup(self):
        super().setup()
        # Add specific setup logic here

    def act(self):
        super().act()
        # Add specific action logic here

    # Add other specific methods as needed

```

### Key Features:

1. **BDI Architecture**: Implements beliefs, goals, and plans, allowing for goal-oriented behavior.
2. **Extensibility**: Designed to be easily extended for creating specific agent types.
3. **Message Handling**: Provides a basic framework for receiving and processing messages.
4. **Plan Execution**: Includes a mechanism for executing applicable plans based on current beliefs and goals.

### Implementation Notes:

- The AgentBase class assumes the existence of Goal, Belief, and Plan classes, which should be implemented in the corresponding model files.
- The is_applicable and execute methods of the Plan class are expected to be implemented to work with the execute_plans method.
- This base class provides a starting point and should be extended with more sophisticated reasoning and action selection mechanisms for complex agent behaviors.

### Future Enhancements:

1. Implement a more advanced BDI reasoning cycle.
2. Add support for prioritizing goals and plans.
3. Implement a more sophisticated belief revision mechanism.
4. Add support for inter-agent communication protocols.
5. Implement persistence for agent state across shutdowns.

This AgentBase class provides a solid foundation for building a variety of agent types within the MABOS platform, ensuring consistency and promoting best practices in agent design and implementation.

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the AgentBase class, its methods, usage, and potential future enhancements. It serves as a guide for developers who will be working with and extending this base class to create specific agent types within the MABOS platform.
