### Implementation Details:

1. **Class Initialization**: The `ERPConfigurationAgent` class inherits from the base `Agent` class and initializes its beliefs, goals, and plans.
2. **Setup Method**: The `setup` method initializes the agent by adding the main goal "ManageERPConfiguration" and three plans: "InitializeERPConfigurationPlan", "UpdateERPConfigurationPlan", and "VisualizeERPConfigurationPlan".
3. **Act Method**: The `act` method executes the agent's plans.
4. **Message Handling**: The `on_message` method processes incoming messages, specifically handling ERP configuration requests.
5. **Goal Management**: The `add_goal` method adds goals to the agent's list of goals.
6. **Belief Management**: The `add_belief` method adds beliefs to the agent's list of beliefs.
7. **Plan Management**: The `add_plan` method adds plans to the agent's list of plans.
8. **Plan Execution**: The `execute_plans` method executes applicable plans based on the agent's beliefs and goals.
9. **ERP Configuration Initialization**: The `initialize_erp_configuration` method sets up the initial ERP configuration and updates the agent's beliefs.
10. **ERP Configuration Update**: The `update_erp_configuration` method modifies an existing ERP configuration based on the current beliefs.
11. **ERP Configuration Visualization**: The `visualize_erp_configuration` method visualizes the ERP configuration.
12. **Request Handling**: The `handle_erp_request` method processes incoming ERP configuration requests.
13. **Configuration Setup**: The `setup_erp_configuration` method simulates the creation of a new ERP configuration.
14. **Configuration Modification**: The `modify_erp_configuration` method simulates the modification of an existing ERP configuration.
15. **Configuration Display**: The `display_erp_configuration` method simulates the display of the ERP configuration.
16. **Belief Retrieval**: The `get_belief` method retrieves the value of a specified belief.
