# Docs: User Authentication UI Agent

The UserAuthenticationUIAgent handles user authentication and access control within the user interface. It ensures secure and controlled access to the system, enhancing the MAS's security and user management capabilities. Here is detailed documentation for implementing the User Authentication UI Agent, including its role, BDI components, and how it fits into the goal-oriented business development and operation multi-agent system SaaS platform. It includes the requested PlantUML diagrams and a detailed explanation of the User Authentication UI Agent's code.

### Role and Purpose:

        self.add_goal(Goal("ManageUserAuthentication", "Maintain"))
        self.add_plan(Plan("AuthenticateUserPlan", self.authenticate_user))
        self.add_plan(Plan("ManageAccessRightsPlan", self.manage_access_rights))

    def act(self):

        if user_credentials:
            authentication_result = self.verify_credentials(user_credentials)
            self.add_belief(Belief("AuthenticationResult", authentication_result))

    def manage_access_rights(self):

        if authentication_result and authentication_result["Status"] == "Authenticated":
            access_rights = self.determine_access_rights(authentication_result["UserID"])
            self.add_belief(Belief("UserAccessRights", access_rights))

    def handle_authentication_request(self, message):
        content = message.content

        # Simulated credential verification
        return {"UserID": credentials["Username"], "Status": "Authenticated"}

    def determine_access_rights(self, user_id):
        # Simulated access rights determination
        return {"UserID": user_id, "Rights": ["Read", "Write"]}

    def get_belief(self, belief_name):
        for belief in self.beliefs:
            if belief.name == belief_name:
                return belief.value
        return None

```

### Implementation Details:

1. **Class Initialization**: The `UserAuthenticationUIAgent` class inherits from the base `Agent` class and initializes its beliefs, goals, and plans.
2. **Setup Method**: The `setup` method initializes the agent by adding the main goal "ManageUserAuthentication" and two plans: "AuthenticateUserPlan" and "ManageAccessRightsPlan".
3. **Act Method**: The `act` method executes the agent's plans.
4. **Message Handling**: The `on_message` method processes incoming messages, specifically handling authentication requests.
5. **Goal Management**: The `add_goal` method adds goals to the agent's list of goals.
6. **Belief Management**: The `add_belief` method adds beliefs to the agent's list of beliefs.
7. **Plan Management**: The `add_plan` method adds plans to the agent's list of plans.
8. **Plan Execution**: The `execute_plans` method executes applicable plans based on the agent's beliefs and goals.
9. **User Authentication**: The `authenticate_user` method verifies user credentials and updates the agent's beliefs.
10. **Access Rights Management**: The `manage_access_rights` method determines and manages user access rights based on authentication results.
11. **Request Handling**: The `handle_authentication_request` method processes incoming authentication requests.
12. **Credential Verification**: The `verify_credentials` method simulates the verification of user credentials.
13. **Access Rights Determination**: The `determine_access_rights` method simulates the determination of user access rights.
14. **Belief Retrieval**: The `get_belief` method retrieves the value of a specified belief.
