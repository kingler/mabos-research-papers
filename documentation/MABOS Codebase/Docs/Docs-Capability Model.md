# Docs: Capability Model

## 1. Overall Description and Purpose

This code defines a `Capability` class, which is an important component in a Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agent system or any AI system that models agent capabilities. The purpose of this code is to provide a flexible and extensible way to represent and manage an agent's capabilities or actions it can perform in its environment.

The `Capability` class encapsulates the concept of an action that an agent can perform, including:

- The name of the capability
- The resources required to perform the action
- The actual action to be performed (as a callable function)
- A method to check if the capability can be performed given available resources
- A method to perform the action

This capability model allows for dynamic checking of whether an action can be performed based on available resources, which is crucial for agents operating in environments with varying resource availability.

## 2. PlantUML Class Diagram

The following PlantUML diagram illustrates the structure of the Capability Model:

```
@startuml
class Capability {
  - name: str
  - required_resources: List[str]
  - action: Callable[[Dict[str, Any]], None]
  + can_perform(available_resources: List[str]): bool
  + perform(context: Dict[str, Any]): None
  + __str__(): str
}
@enduml

```

## 3. Data Schema Description

`Capability` (Class):

- `name` (str): The name of the capability
- `required_resources` (List[str]): A list of resources required to perform the capability
- `action` (Callable[[Dict[str, Any]], None]): A callable that represents the action to be performed

## 4. Breakdown of Functions/Methods

### `__init__(self, name: str, required_resources: List[str], action: Callable[[Dict[str, Any]], None])`

- Purpose: Initialize a new Capability object
- Parameters:
    - `name` (str): The name of the capability
    - `required_resources` (List[str]): A list of resources required to perform the capability
    - `action` (Callable[[Dict[str, Any]], None]): A callable that represents the action to be performed
- Return value: None
- Key logic: Initializes the capability with the given name, required resources, and action

### `can_perform(self, available_resources: List[str]) -> bool`

- Purpose: Check if the capability can be performed given the available resources
- Parameters:
    - `available_resources` (List[str]): A list of currently available resources
- Return value: bool - True if the capability can be performed, False otherwise
- Key logic: Checks if all required resources are present in the available resources

### `perform(self, context: Dict[str, Any]) -> None`

- Purpose: Perform the capability's action
- Parameters:
    - `context` (Dict[str, Any]): A dictionary containing contextual information for the action
- Return value: None
- Key logic: Calls the action callable with the provided context

### `__str__(self)`

- Purpose: Provide a string representation of the Capability object
- Parameters: None
- Return value: str - A formatted string describing the capability
- Key logic: Returns a string containing the capability's name and required resources

## 5. Key Python Libraries Used

1. `typing`: Used for type hinting, improving code readability and enabling better static type checking. Specifically, it uses `List`, `Dict`, `Any`, and `Callable`.

## 6. Other Class Imports and Their Relationships

This code doesn't import any other custom classes. It is self-contained but designed to be used within a larger agent system. The `Capability` class would typically be used by:

1. The main agent class to represent its set of possible actions
2. A planning system that selects appropriate capabilities to achieve goals
3. A resource management system that tracks available resources and determines which capabilities can be performed

## 7. Important Notes on Usage, Limitations, and Future Improvements

Usage:

- Create `Capability` instances to represent actions an agent can perform.
- Use the `can_perform()` method to check if a capability can be executed given current resources.
- Use the `perform()` method to execute the capability's action with given context.

Limitations:

- The current implementation assumes that resources are represented as strings.
- There's no built-in mechanism for handling partial resource availability or resource quantities.
- The action is represented as a simple callable, which may not be sufficient for more complex actions.

Potential future improvements:

1. Implement a more sophisticated resource model that includes quantities or capacities.
2. Add support for preconditions and postconditions for capabilities.
3. Implement a mechanism for capability composition (combining simpler capabilities into more complex ones).
4. Add support for capability learning or adaptation over time.
5. Implement a system for handling conflicts between capabilities.
6. Add methods for estimating the cost or utility of performing a capability.
7. Implement a mechanism for capability prioritization.
8. Add support for capability parameters or variations.
9. Implement a system for handling capability failures or partial successes.
10. Add support for temporal aspects of capabilities (e.g., duration, cooldown periods).
