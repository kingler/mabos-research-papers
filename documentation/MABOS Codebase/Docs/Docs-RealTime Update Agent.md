# Docs: Â RealTime Update Agent

The RealTimeUpdateAgent provides real-time updates and notifications within the user interface. It ensures that users are informed of system changes promptly, improving the MAS's real-time interaction capabilities. Here is detailed documentation for implementing the Real-Time Update Agent, including its role, BDI components, and how it fits into the goal-oriented business development and operation multi-agent system SaaS platform. It includes the requested PlantUML diagrams and a detailed explanation of the Real-Time Update Agent's code.

### Role and Purpose:

        super(RealTimeUpdateAgent, self).__init__(aid)
        self.beliefs = []
        self.goals = []
        self.plans = []

    def setup(self):
        display_message(self.aid.name, "Setting up RealTimeUpdateAgent")
        self.add_goal(Goal("ProvideRealTimeUpdates", "Maintain"))
        self.add_plan(Plan("CollectUpdateDataPlan", self.collect_update_data))
        self.add_plan(Plan("SendRealTimeUpdatesPlan", self.send_real_time_updates))

    def act(self):
        display_message(self.aid.name, "Acting in RealTimeUpdateAgent")
        self.execute_plans()

    def on_message(self, message: ACLMessage):

    def add_goal(self, goal):
        self.goals.append(goal)

    def add_belief(self, belief):
        self.beliefs.append(belief)

    def add_plan(self, plan):

                plan.execute()

    def collect_update_data(self):
        display_message(self.aid.name, "Collecting update data")
        # Logic to collect update data
        update_data = self.gather_update_data()
        self.add_belief(Belief("UpdateData", update_data))

    def send_real_time_updates(self):

        update_data = self.get_belief("UpdateData")
        if update_data:
            self.broadcast_updates(update_data)

    def handle_update_request(self, message):
        content = message.content
        self.add_belief(Belief("UpdateRequest", content))
        self.add_goal(Goal("ProcessUpdateRequest", "Achieve"))

    def gather_update_data(self):
        # Simulated update data collection
        return {"Event1": "Update1", "Event2": "Update2"}

    def broadcast_updates(self, update_data):
        for event, update in update_data.items():
            display_message(self.aid.name, f"Broadcasting update for {event}: {update}")

    def get_belief(self, belief_name):
        for belief in self.beliefs:
            if belief.name == belief_name:
                return belief.value
        return None

```

### Implementation Details:

1. **Class Initialization**: The `RealTimeUpdateAgent` class inherits from the base `Agent` class and initializes its beliefs, goals, and plans.
2. **Setup Method**: The `setup` method initializes the agent by adding the main goal "ProvideRealTimeUpdates" and two plans: "CollectUpdateDataPlan" and "SendRealTimeUpdatesPlan".
3. **Act Method**: The `act` method executes the agent's plans.
4. **Message Handling**: The `on_message` method processes incoming messages, specifically handling update requests.
5. **Goal Management**: The `add_goal` method adds goals to the agent's list of goals.
6. **Belief Management**: The `add_belief` method adds beliefs to the agent's list of beliefs.
7. **Plan Management**: The `add_plan` method adds plans to the agent's list of plans.
8. **Plan Execution**: The `execute_plans` method executes applicable plans based on the agent's beliefs and goals.
9. **Update Data Collection**: The `collect_update_data` method gathers relevant update data.
10. **Real-Time Updates**: The `send_real_time_updates` method generates and sends notifications based on the collected update data.
11. **Request Handling**: The `handle_update_request` method processes incoming update requests.
12. **Data Gathering**: The `gather_update_data` method simulates the collection of update data.
13. **Broadcasting Updates**: The `broadcast_updates` method broadcasts the collected updates to users.
14. **Belief Retrieval**: The `get_belief` method retrieves the value of a specified belief.
