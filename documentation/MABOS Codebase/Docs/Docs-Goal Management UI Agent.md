# Docs: Goal Management UI Agent

The GoalManagementUIAgent provides tools for managing and visualizing goals within the user interface. It enhances goal tracking and management, improving the MAS's goal management capabilities. Here is detailed documentation for implementing the Goal Management UI Agent, including its role, BDI components, and how it fits into the goal-oriented business development and operation multi-agent system SaaS platform. It includes the requested PlantUML diagrams and a detailed explanation of the Goal Management UI Agent's code.

### Role and Purpose:

The Goal Management UI Agent is responsible for providing a user interface to manage, track, and visualize goals within the MAS. It plays a crucial role in enhancing the system's goal management capabilities by allowing users to create, monitor, and visualize goals efficiently. This agent improves user interaction and system effectiveness by providing clear insights into the status and progress of various goals within the system.

### BDI Components:

### a. Beliefs:

- Current state of goals
- Goal tracking data
- Visualization preferences
- User requests for goal management
- System constraints and capabilities

### b. Desires:

- Provide comprehensive UI for managing goals
- Ensure goals are tracked accurately and efficiently
- Visualize goals in a clear and informative manner
- Respond to user requests promptly
- Maintain a consistent and user-friendly interface

### c. Intentions:

- Create new goals based on user input
- Track the progress of existing goals
- Visualize goals and their statuses
- Update beliefs with new goal data
- Communicate with other agents to gather necessary information

        self.add_plan(Plan("CreateGoalPlan", self.create_goal))
        self.add_plan(Plan("TrackGoalsPlan", self.track_goals))
        self.add_plan(Plan("VisualizeGoalsPlan", self.visualize_goals))

    def act(self):
        display_message(self.aid.name, "Acting in GoalManagementUIAgent")
        self.execute_plans()

    def on_message(self, message: ACLMessage):
        display_message(self.aid.name, f"Received message: {message.content}")
        if message.performative == ACLMessage.REQUEST:
            self.handle_goal_request(message)

    def add_goal(self, goal):
        self.goals.append(goal)

    def add_belief(self, belief):
        self.beliefs.append(belief)

    def add_plan(self, plan):
        self.plans.append(plan)

    def execute_plans(self):
        for plan in self.plans:
            if plan.is_applicable(self.beliefs, self.goals):
                plan.execute()

    def create_goal(self):
        display_message(self.aid.name, "Creating goal")
        goal_data = self.initialize_goal()
        self.add_belief(Belief("GoalData", goal_data))

    def track_goals(self):
        display_message(self.aid.name, "Tracking goals")
        goal_data = self.get_belief("GoalData")
        if goal_data:
            tracked_goals = self.monitor_goals(goal_data)
            self.add_belief(Belief("TrackedGoals", tracked_goals))

    def visualize_goals(self):
        display_message(self.aid.name, "Visualizing goals")
        tracked_goals = self.get_belief("TrackedGoals")
        if tracked_goals:
            self.display_goals(tracked_goals)

    def handle_goal_request(self, message):
        content = message.content
        self.add_belief(Belief("GoalRequest", content))
        self.add_goal(Goal("ProcessGoalRequest", "Achieve"))

    def initialize_goal(self):
        # Simulated goal initialization
        return {"GoalName": "New Goal", "Status": "Active"}

    def monitor_goals(self, goal_data):
        # Simulated goal tracking
        goal_data["Status"] = "In Progress"
        return goal_data

    def display_goals(self, goals):
        # Simulated goal visualization
        display_message(self.aid.name, f"Displaying goals: {goals}")

    def get_belief(self, belief_name):
        for belief in self.beliefs:
            if belief.name == belief_name:
                return belief.value
        return None

```

### Implementation Details:

1. **Class Initialization**: The `GoalManagementUIAgent` class inherits from the base `Agent` class and initializes its beliefs, goals, and plans.
2. **Setup Method**: The `setup` method initializes the agent by adding the main goal "ManageGoals" and three plans: "CreateGoalPlan", "TrackGoalsPlan", and "VisualizeGoalsPlan".
3. **Act Method**: The `act` method executes the agent's plans.
4. **Message Handling**: The `on_message` method processes incoming messages, specifically handling goal requests.
5. **Goal Management**: The `add_goal` method adds goals to the agent's list of goals.
6. **Belief Management**: The `add_belief` method adds beliefs to the agent's list of beliefs.
7. **Plan Management**: The `add_plan` method adds plans to the agent's list of plans.
8. **Plan Execution**: The `execute_plans` method executes applicable plans based on the agent's beliefs and goals.
9. **Goal Creation**: The `create_goal` method initializes a new goal and adds it to the agent's beliefs.
10. **Goal Tracking**: The `track_goals` method monitors the progress of existing goals.
11. **Goal Visualization**: The `visualize_goals` method creates visual representations of goals and their statuses.
12. **Request Handling**: The `handle_goal_request` method processes incoming goal management requests.
13. **Goal Initialization**: The `initialize_goal` method simulates the creation of a new goal.
14. **Goal Monitoring**: The `monitor_goals` method simulates the tracking of goal progress.
15. **Goal Display**: The `display_goals` method simulates the visualization of goals.
16. **Belief Retrieval**: The `get_belief` method retrieves the value of a specified belief.
