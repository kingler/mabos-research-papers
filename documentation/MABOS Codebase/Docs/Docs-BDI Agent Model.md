# Docs BDI Agent Model

## 1. Overall Description and Purpose

This code implements a Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agent, a type of intelligent agent based on the BDI software model. The BDI model is a framework for designing rational agents, particularly in artificial intelligence and cognitive science. The agent operates on three key concepts:

- Beliefs: The agent's knowledge about the world
- Desires: The agent's goals or objectives
- Intentions: The agent's committed plans to achieve its goals

The purpose of this code is to provide a flexible and extensible implementation of a BDI agent that can be used in various AI applications, such as autonomous systems, multi-agent systems, or cognitive modeling.

## 2. PlantUML State Machine Diagram

The following PlantUML diagram illustrates the key states and transitions in the BDI agent's reasoning loop:

```
@startuml
[*] --> UpdateBeliefs : Start

state UpdateBeliefs
state GenerateOptions
state FilterOptions
state Plan
state ExecuteIntention

UpdateBeliefs --> GenerateOptions : Beliefs updated
GenerateOptions --> FilterOptions : Options generated
FilterOptions --> Plan : Goal selected
FilterOptions --> UpdateBeliefs : No achievable goals
Plan --> ExecuteIntention : Plan found
Plan --> UpdateBeliefs : No applicable plan
ExecuteIntention --> UpdateBeliefs : Plan executed

## 3. Data Schema Description

The BDI agent uses several key data structures:

1. `BeliefSet`: Represents the agent's beliefs about the world. It's likely implemented as a set of predicates with boolean values.
2. `Goal`: Represents a desire or objective of the agent. It has a name and a method to check if it's achievable given the current beliefs.
3. `Plan`: Represents a sequence of actions to achieve a goal. It has a name, methods to check applicability and execute the plan.
4. `PlanLibrary`: A collection of plans available to the agent.

The `BDIEngine` class itself maintains:

- `beliefs`: An instance of `BeliefSet`
- `desires`: A list of `Goal` objects
- `intentions`: A list of `Plan` objects (currently executing plans)
- `plan_library`: An instance of `PlanLibrary`

## 4. Breakdown of Functions/Methods

### `__init__(self, name: str)`

- Purpose: Initialize a new BDI agent
- Parameters:
    - `name` (str): The name of the agent
- Return value: None
- Key logic: Initializes the agent's name, beliefs, desires, intentions, and plan library

### `async def update_beliefs(self, new_beliefs: Dict[str, bool])`

- Purpose: Update the agent's beliefs based on new information
- Parameters:
    - `new_beliefs` (Dict[str, bool]): A dictionary of predicates and their truth values
- Return value: None
- Key logic: Iterates through the new beliefs and adds them to the agent's belief set

### `def generate_options(self) -> List[Goal]`

- Purpose: Generate possible goals based on current beliefs and desires
- Parameters: None
- Return value: List[Goal] - A list of achievable goals
- Key logic: Filters the agent's desires to only include those that are achievable given the current beliefs

### `def filter_options(self, options: List[Goal]) -> Goal`

- Purpose: Select the most appropriate goal from the options
- Parameters:
    - `options` (List[Goal]): A list of achievable goals
- Return value: Goal or None - The selected goal, or None if no options are available
- Key logic: Simple selection strategy that chooses the first achievable goal

### `def plan(self, goal: Goal) -> Plan`

- Purpose: Find a suitable plan for the given goal
- Parameters:
    - `goal` (Goal): The goal to plan for
- Return value: Plan or None - A suitable plan, or None if no applicable plan is found
- Key logic: Filters the plans in the plan library to find those applicable to the goal and current beliefs

### `async def execute_intention(self, plan: Plan)`

- Purpose: Execute the selected plan
- Parameters:
    - `plan` (Plan): The plan to execute
- Return value: None
- Key logic: Asynchronously executes the plan and prints the result

### `async def bdi_loop(self)`

- Purpose: Main BDI reasoning loop
- Parameters: None
- Return value: None
- Key logic: Implements the core BDI cycle (update beliefs, generate options, filter options, plan, execute intention)

### `def add_goal(self, goal: Goal)`

- Purpose: Add a new goal to the agent's desires
- Parameters:
    - `goal` (Goal): The goal to add
- Return value: None
- Key logic: Appends the new goal to the agent's desires list

### `def add_plan(self, plan: Plan)`

- Purpose: Add a new plan to the agent's plan library
- Parameters:
    - `plan` (Plan): The plan to add
- Return value: None
- Key logic: Adds the new plan to the agent's plan library

### `async def run(self)`

- Purpose: Run the BDI agent
- Parameters: None
- Return value: None
- Key logic: Prints a start message and initiates the BDI loop

## 5. Key Python Libraries Used

1. `asyncio`: Used for asynchronous programming, allowing the agent to perform non-blocking operations.
2. `typing`: Used for type hinting, improving code readability and enabling better static type checking.

## 6. Other Class Imports and Their Relationships

1. `Goal` (from `models.goal_model`): Represents a desire or objective of the agent.
2. `BeliefSet` (from `models.belief_model`): Represents the agent's beliefs about the world.
3. `Plan` and `PlanLibrary` (from `models.plan_model`): Represent individual plans and the collection of available plans, respectively.

These imported classes are core components of the BDI model and are used extensively throughout the `BDIEngine` class.

## 7. Important Notes on Usage, Limitations, and Future Improvements

Usage:

- To use this BDI agent, create an instance of `BDIEngine`, add goals and plans, and then call the `run()` method.
- The agent operates asynchronously, so it should be run in an asyncio event loop.

Limitations:

- The current implementation uses a simple strategy for goal selection (first achievable goal).
- There's no mechanism for handling conflicting goals or plans.
- The belief update process is simplistic and may not handle complex reasoning about beliefs.

Potential future improvements:

1. Implement a more sophisticated goal selection mechanism, possibly using utility functions or priority levels.
2. Add support for handling conflicting goals and plans.
3. Enhance the belief system to support more complex reasoning, such as belief revision and uncertain beliefs.
4. Implement a more robust plan execution mechanism with error handling and recovery strategies.
5. Add support for learning from experience, allowing the agent to improve its decision-making over time.
6. Implement inter-agent communication for multi-agent systems.
7. Create a visualization tool for monitoring the agent's internal state and decision-making process.
8. Optimize performance for large-scale applications with many goals and plans.
