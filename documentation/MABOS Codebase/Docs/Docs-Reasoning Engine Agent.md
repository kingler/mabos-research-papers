### Implementation Details:

1. **Class Initialization**: The `ReasoningEngineAgent` class inherits from the base `Agent` class and initializes its beliefs, goals, and plans.
2. **Setup Method**: The `setup` method initializes the agent by adding the main goal "PerformReasoning" and two plans: "EvaluateOptionsPlan" and "SelectBestOptionPlan".
3. **Act Method**: The `act` method executes the agent's plans.
4. **Message Handling**: The `on_message` method processes incoming messages, specifically handling reasoning requests.
5. **Goal Management**: The `add_goal` method adds goals to the agent's list of goals.
6. **Belief Management**: The `add_belief` method adds beliefs to the agent's list of beliefs.
7. **Plan Management**: The `add_plan` method adds plans to the agent's list of plans.
8. **Plan Execution**: The `execute_plans` method executes applicable plans based on the agent's beliefs and goals.
9. **Option Evaluation**: The `evaluate_options` method collects and evaluates available options for decision-making.
10. **Best Option Selection**: The `select_best_option` method selects the best option based on the evaluation results.
11. **Reasoning Request Handling**: The `handle_reasoning_request` method processes incoming reasoning requests.
12. **Option Collection**: The `collect_options` method simulates the collection of available options.
13. **Evaluation Algorithm**: The `run_evaluation_algorithm` method simulates the evaluation of options.
14. **Best Option Selection**: The `choose_best_option` method selects the best option based on the evaluation results.
15. **Belief Retrieval**: The `get_belief` method retrieves the value of a specified belief.
