# Docs: Situation Manager

## 1. Overall Description and Purpose

This code defines a situation management system, which is crucial for context-aware systems, intelligent agents, and adaptive software. The implementation includes two main classes:

1. `Situation`: Represents a specific situation or context with associated conditions.
2. `SituationManager`: Manages the current situation, tracks situation history, and provides methods for situation-related operations.

The purpose of this code is to provide a flexible and extensible framework for managing and reasoning about situations or contexts in which a system or agent operates. It can be used in various applications such as context-aware services, adaptive user interfaces, or intelligent decision-making systems that need to respond to changing situations.

## 2. PlantUML Class Diagram

The following PlantUML diagram illustrates the structure of the Situation Manager:

```
@startuml
class Situation {
  - name: str
  - conditions: Dict[str, Any]
  - timestamp: datetime
  + __str__(): str
}

class SituationManager {
  - current_situation: Situation
  - situation_history: List[Situation]
  + update_situation(new_situation: Situation): None
  + get_current_situation(): Situation
  + is_situation_active(situation_name: str, state: Dict[str, Any]): bool
  + get_situation_history(): List[Situation]
  + clear_history(): None
}

SituationManager o-- "0..1" Situation : current_situation
SituationManager o-- "*" Situation : situation_history

## 3. Data Schema Description

1. `Situation` (Class):
    - `name` (str): The name of the situation
    - `conditions` (Dict[str, Any]): A dictionary of conditions that define the situation
    - `timestamp` (datetime): The time when the situation was created
2. `SituationManager` (Class):
    - `current_situation` (Situation): The currently active situation
    - `situation_history` (List[Situation]): A list of previous situations

## 4. Breakdown of Functions/Methods

### Situation Class

### `__init__(self, name: str, conditions: Dict[str, Any])`

- Purpose: Initialize a new Situation object
- Parameters:
    - `name` (str): The name of the situation
    - `conditions` (Dict[str, Any]): A dictionary of conditions that define the situation
- Return value: None
- Key logic: Stores the name and conditions, and sets the timestamp to the current time

### `__str__(self)`

- Purpose: Provide a string representation of the Situation object
- Parameters: None
- Return value: str - A formatted string describing the situation
- Key logic: Returns a string containing the situation's name, conditions, and timestamp

### SituationManager Class

### `__init__(self)`

- Purpose: Initialize a new SituationManager object
- Parameters: None
- Return value: None
- Key logic: Initializes the current situation as None and an empty list for situation history

### `update_situation(self, new_situation: Situation) -> None`

- Purpose: Update the current situation
- Parameters:
    - `new_situation` (Situation): The new situation to set as current
- Return value: None
- Key logic:
    1. If there's a current situation, it's added to the history
    2. Sets the new situation as the current situation

### `get_current_situation(self) -> Situation`

- Purpose: Retrieve the current situation
- Parameters: None
- Return value: Situation - The current situation
- Key logic: Returns the current_situation attribute

### `is_situation_active(self, situation_name: str, state: Dict[str, Any]) -> bool`

- Purpose: Check if a specific situation is currently active
- Parameters:
    - `situation_name` (str): The name of the situation to check
    - `state` (Dict[str, Any]): The current state to compare against the situation's conditions
- Return value: bool - True if the situation is active, False otherwise
- Key logic:
    1. Checks if the current situation's name matches the given name
    2. If so, compares all conditions of the current situation with the given state
    3. Returns True only if all conditions are met

### `get_situation_history(self) -> List[Situation]`

- Purpose: Retrieve the history of situations
- Parameters: None
- Return value: List[Situation] - A list of all previous situations
- Key logic: Returns the situation_history attribute

### `clear_history(self) -> None`

- Purpose: Clear the situation history
- Parameters: None
- Return value: None
- Key logic: Clears the situation_history list

## 5. Key Python Libraries Used

The code uses the following Python standard libraries:

1. `typing`: Used for type hinting, improving code readability and enabling better static type checking. Specifically, it uses `Dict`, `Any`, and `List`.
2. `datetime`: Used to timestamp situations when they are created.

## 6. Other Class Imports and Their Relationships

This code doesn't import any other custom classes. It is self-contained but designed to be used within a larger system that needs to manage and reason about situations or contexts.

## 7. Important Notes on Usage, Limitations, and Future Improvements

Usage:

- Create an instance of `SituationManager`.
- Create `Situation` objects with appropriate names and conditions.
- Use `update_situation()` to set the current situation.
- Use `is_situation_active()` to check if a specific situation is active given the current state.
- Use `get_situation_history()` to retrieve the history of situations.

Limitations:

- The current implementation assumes that all conditions must be met for a situation to be active.
- There's no built-in mechanism for handling partially matched situations or fuzzy matching.
- The situation history could potentially grow very large over time, which might impact memory usage.

Potential future improvements:

1. Implement support for partial situation matching or fuzzy logic in condition evaluation.
2. Add a mechanism to limit the size of the situation history (e.g., keeping only the last N situations or situations within a certain time frame).
3. Implement a more sophisticated situation transition logic, possibly with transition rules or constraints.
4. Add support for hierarchical or nested situations.
5. Implement a mechanism for predicting future situations based on historical data.
6. Add support for situation priorities or urgency levels.
7. Implement a query language for more complex situation retrieval and analysis.
8. Add support for temporal reasoning about situations (e.g., how long a situation has been active).
9. Implement a visualization tool for situation transitions and history.
10. Add support for concurrent or overlapping situations.

Example Usage:

```python
# Create a SituationManager
manager = SituationManager()

# Create and update situations
situation1 = Situation("Normal", {"temperature": 20, "humidity": 50})
manager.update_situation(situation1)

# Check if a situation is active
current_state = {"temperature": 22, "humidity": 55}
is_normal = manager.is_situation_active("Normal", current_state)
print(f"Is Normal situation active? {is_normal}")

# Update to a new situation
situation2 = Situation("Hot", {"temperature": 30, "humidity": 60})
manager.update_situation(situation2)

# Get current situation
current = manager.get_current_situation()
print(f"Current situation: {current}")

# Get situation history
history = manager.get_situation_history()
print(f"Situation history: {history}")

```

This example demonstrates how to create situations, update the current situation, check if a situation is active, and retrieve the situation history using the SituationManager.
