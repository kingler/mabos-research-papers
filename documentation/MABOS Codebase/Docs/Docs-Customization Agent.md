# Docs: Customization Agent

The CustomizationAgent allows users to customize the user interface according to their preferences. It ensures flexibility and personalization options, enhancing the MAS's UI customization capabilities. Here is detailed documentation for implementing the Customization Agent, including its role, BDI components, and how it fits into the goal-oriented business development and operation multi-agent system SaaS platform. It includes the requested PlantUML diagrams and a detailed explanation of the Customization Agent's code.

### Role and Purpose:

The Customization Agent is responsible for managing user interface customizations within the multi-agent system.

### Detailed Code Explanation:

Here's a detailed explanation of the key components and methods for implementing the Customization Agent:

```python
from pade.core.agent import Agent
from pade.acl.messages import ACLMessage
from pade.misc.utility import display_message
from models.goal_model import Goal
from models.belief_model import Belief
from models.plan_model import Plan

class CustomizationAgent(Agent):
    def __init__(self, aid):
        super(CustomizationAgent, self).__init__(aid)
        self.beliefs = []
        self.goals = []
        self.plans = []

    def setup(self):
        display_message(self.aid.name, "Setting up CustomizationAgent")
        self.add_goal(Goal("EnableUICustomization", "Maintain"))
        self.add_plan(Plan("CollectUserPreferencesPlan", self.collect_user_preferences))
        self.add_plan(Plan("ApplyCustomizationsPlan", self.apply_customizations))

    def act(self):
        display_message(self.aid.name, "Acting in CustomizationAgent")
        self.execute_plans()

    def on_message(self, message: ACLMessage):
        display_message(self.aid.name, f"Received message: {message.content}")
        if message.performative == ACLMessage.REQUEST:
            self.handle_customization_request(message)

    def add_goal(self, goal):
        self.goals.append(goal)

    def add_belief(self, belief):
        self.beliefs.append(belief)

    def add_plan(self, plan):
        self.plans.append(plan)

    def execute_plans(self):
        for plan in self.plans:
            if plan.is_applicable(self.beliefs, self.goals):
                plan.execute()

    def collect_user_preferences(self):
        display_message(self.aid.name, "Collecting user preferences")
        user_preferences = self.gather_user_preferences()
        self.add_belief(Belief("UserPreferences", user_preferences))

    def apply_customizations(self):
        display_message(self.aid.name, "Applying customizations")
        user_preferences = self.get_belief("UserPreferences")
        if user_preferences:
            self.customize_ui(user_preferences)

    def handle_customization_request(self, message):
        content = message.content
        self.add_belief(Belief("CustomizationRequest", content))
        self.add_goal(Goal("ProcessCustomizationRequest", "Achieve"))

    def gather_user_preferences(self):
        # Simulated user preferences collection
        return {"Theme": "Dark", "Layout": "Compact"}

    def customize_ui(self, preferences):
        # Simulated UI customization
        display_message(self.aid.name, f"Applying customizations: {preferences}")

    def get_belief(self, belief_name):
        for belief in self.beliefs:
            if belief.name == belief_name:
                return belief.value
        return None

```

### Implementation Details:

1. **Class Initialization**: The `CustomizationAgent` class inherits from the base `Agent` class and initializes its beliefs, goals, and plans.
2. **Setup Method**: The `setup` method initializes the agent by adding the main goal "EnableUICustomization" and two plans: "CollectUserPreferencesPlan" and "ApplyCustomizationsPlan".
3. **Act Method**: The `act` method executes the agent's plans.
4. **Message Handling**: The `on_message` method processes incoming messages, specifically handling customization requests.
5. **Goal Management**: The `add_goal` method adds goals to the agent's list of goals.
6. **Belief Management**: The `add_belief` method adds beliefs to the agent's list of beliefs.
7. **Plan Management**: The `add_plan` method adds plans to the agent's list of plans.
8. **Plan Execution**: The `execute_plans` method executes applicable plans based on the agent's beliefs and goals.
9. **User Preference Collection**: The `collect_user_preferences` method gathers user preferences and updates the agent's beliefs.
10. **Customization Application**: The `apply_customizations` method applies UI customizations based on user preferences.
11. **Request Handling**: The `handle_customization_request` method processes incoming customization requests.
12. **Preference Gathering**: The `gather_user_preferences` method simulates the collection of user preferences.
13. **UI Customization**: The `customize_ui` method simulates the application of UI customizations.
14. **Belief Retrieval**: The `get_belief` method retrieves the value of a specified belief.
