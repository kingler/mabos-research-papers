### Implementation Details:

1. The `CodeGenerationAgent` class inherits from a base `Agent` class and initializes its BDI components (beliefs, desires, intentions) and plans.
2. The `init_*` methods set up the initial state of the agent, including its beliefs about the system specifications and existing codebase, desires related to code generation, intentions to act, and plans to achieve its goals.
3. The main `run` method implements the agent's reasoning cycle, continuously processing messages, executing intentions, and updating beliefs.
4. Each plan (e.g., `analyze_specifications`, `generate_code`) is implemented as an asynchronous method, allowing for non-blocking execution.
5. The `process_messages` method handles incoming communications from other agents, such as new specifications or code review feedback.
6. `execute_intentions` method goes through active intentions and executes their associated plans.
7. Helper methods (e.g., `select_templates`, `apply_coding_standards`) encapsulate specific functionalities that need to be implemented using appropriate code generation techniques and best practices.

To implement this agent:

1. Set up the base Agent class and BDI components (Belief, Desire, Intention, Plan).
2. Implement the KnowledgeBase class to store code generation templates, coding standards, and optimization rules.
3. Create the CodeGenerator and CodeValidator classes to handle the core code generation and validation logic.
4. Develop parsers for design specifications and models to extract necessary information for code generation.
5. Implement template engines for different programming languages and component types.
6. Create optimization algorithms to improve the generated code's quality and performance.
7. Develop validation mechanisms to ensure generated code meets specifications and coding standards.
8. Implement integration logic to merge generated code with existing codebases.
9. Create documentation generation capabilities for the produced code.
10. Develop communication protocols for interacting with other agents, especially the Architecture Design Agent and Development Agent.
11. Create unit tests to verify the agent's behavior and integration tests to ensure proper interaction with other system components.

This implementation provides a robust framework for the Code Generation Agent, allowing it to automate code production while ensuring quality, consistency, and alignment with design specifications. The modular design allows for easy extension to support multiple programming languages and code generation strategies.
