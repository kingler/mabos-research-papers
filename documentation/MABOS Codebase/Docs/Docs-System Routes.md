# Docs: System Routes

## Overall Description and Purpose

This code implements the API routes for system-level operations in the MABOS (Multi-Agent Based Optimization System) SaaS Platform. It uses FastAPI to define endpoints for retrieving system status, configuration, and metrics, as well as performing system-wide operations like restarting, backing up, and restoring the system. The purpose of this module is to:

- Provide a RESTful interface for system-level management and monitoring
- Handle HTTP requests related to system operations
- Interact with the Multi-Agent System (MAS) manager to perform system-level tasks
- Handle errors and return appropriate HTTP responses

This module serves as the interface between HTTP clients and the underlying MAS, allowing users to monitor and manage the overall system through API calls.

```

!define FASTAPI FastAPI

package "System Routes" {
    [APIRouter] as ROUTER
    [get_system_status] as STATUS
    [get_system_config] as GET_CONFIG
    [update_system_config] as UPDATE_CONFIG
    [get_system_metrics] as METRICS
    [restart_system] as RESTART
    [create_system_backup] as BACKUP
    [restore_system_backup] as RESTORE
}

## 3. Key Components

1. `APIRouter`: FastAPI router for grouping system-related endpoints
2. Route functions:
    - `get_system_status`: Retrieve the current status of the MAS
    - `get_system_config`: Retrieve the current system configuration
    - `update_system_config`: Update the system configuration
    - `get_system_metrics`: Retrieve current system metrics
    - `restart_system`: Restart the entire MAS
    - `create_system_backup`: Create a backup of the current system state
    - `restore_system_backup`: Restore the system from a previous backup
3. Dependency injection: `get_mas_manager` for accessing the MAS manager

## 4. Breakdown of Functions/Methods

### `get_system_status()`

- HTTP Method: GET
- Endpoint: "/status"
- Purpose: Retrieve the current status of the MAS
- Parameters:
    - `mas_manager`: Injected MAS manager
- Return value: SystemStatus - Current system status
- Key logic: Calls `mas_manager.get_system_status()`

### `get_system_config()`

- HTTP Method: GET
- Endpoint: "/config"
- Purpose: Retrieve the current system configuration
- Parameters:
    - `mas_manager`: Injected MAS manager
- Return value: SystemConfig - Current system configuration
- Key logic: Calls `mas_manager.get_system_config()`

### `update_system_config()`

- HTTP Method: PUT
- Endpoint: "/config"
- Purpose: Update the system configuration
- Parameters:
    - `config`: SystemConfig - New system configuration
    - `mas_manager`: Injected MAS manager
- Return value: SystemConfig - Updated system configuration
- Key logic: Calls `mas_manager.update_system_config()`, handles ValueError

### `get_system_metrics()`

- HTTP Method: GET
- Endpoint: "/metrics"
- Purpose: Retrieve current system metrics
- Parameters:
    - `mas_manager`: Injected MAS manager
- Return value: SystemMetrics - Current system metrics
- Key logic: Calls `mas_manager.get_system_metrics()`

### `restart_system()`

- HTTP Method: POST
- Endpoint: "/restart"
- Purpose: Restart the entire MAS
- Parameters:
    - `mas_manager`: Injected MAS manager
- Return value: Dict[str, str] - Success message
- Key logic: Calls `mas_manager.restart_system()`

### `create_system_backup()`

- HTTP Method: POST
- Endpoint: "/backup"
- Purpose: Create a backup of the current system state
- Parameters:
    - `mas_manager`: Injected MAS manager
- Return value: Dict[str, str] - Success message and backup ID
- Key logic: Calls `mas_manager.create_system_backup()`

### `restore_system_backup()`

- HTTP Method: POST
- Endpoint: "/restore/{backup_id}"
- Purpose: Restore the system from a previous backup
- Parameters:
    - `backup_id`: str - ID of the backup to restore
    - `mas_manager`: Injected MAS manager
- Return value: Dict[str, str] - Success message
- Key logic: Calls `mas_manager.restore_system_backup()`, handles ValueError

## 5. Key Python Libraries and Frameworks Used

1. `fastapi`: Used for defining API routes and handling HTTP requests
2. Custom schemas: `SystemStatus`, `SystemConfig`, `SystemMetrics` from `..schemas.system_schemas`
3. Custom dependency: `get_mas_manager` from `..dependencies`

## 6. Error Handling

- 400 Bad Request: Raised for ValueError in update_system_config and restore_system_backup
- 500 Internal Server Error: Raised for general exceptions in all endpoints

## 7. Important Notes on Usage, Configuration, and Future Improvements

Usage:

- This router should be included in the main FastAPI application with a prefix (e.g., "/api/system")
- All endpoints expect and return JSON data
- The MAS manager is injected into each route function using FastAPI's dependency injection system

Configuration:

- The router uses the default FastAPI configuration
- Additional middleware or security measures should be implemented at the application level

Potential future improvements:

1. Implement more granular error handling and custom exception types
2. Add authentication and authorization checks for sensitive operations (e.g., restart, backup, restore)
3. Implement rate limiting for system-wide operations to prevent abuse
4. Add endpoints for more detailed system diagnostics and troubleshooting
5. Implement a mechanism for scheduling system maintenance tasks
6. Add support for partial system configuration updates
7. Implement versioning for system configurations and backups
8. Add endpoints for system log retrieval and analysis
9. Implement a notification system for important system events or alerts
10. Add support for distributed system management in a multi-node environment

Example Usage:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from .routes import system_routes

app = FastAPI()
app.include_router(system_routes.router, prefix="/api/system", tags=["system"])

```

This includes the system routes in the main FastAPI application with the prefix "/api/system".

I've created comprehensive documentation for the System Routes code you provided. This documentation follows a structure similar to the previous examples, adapted to fit the nature of a FastAPI router module for system-level operations. It includes an overall description, a PlantUML diagram showing the structure of the route functions and their relationship to the MAS manager, a description of key components, a breakdown of functions, key Python libraries used, notes on error handling, and important notes on usage, configuration, and potential future improvements.

The documentation is formatted in Markdown for easy readability and includes PlantUML diagram code for the module structure diagram. This should provide a clear and detailed guide for developers working with or extending these system routes within the MABOS SaaS Platform API.

Would you like me to explain or elaborate on any specific part of the documentation?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
