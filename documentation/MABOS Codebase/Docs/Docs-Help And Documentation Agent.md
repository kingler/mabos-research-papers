# Docs: Help And Documentation Agent

The HelpAndDocumentationAgent provides help and documentation resources within the user interface. It ensures that users have access to necessary information and support, enhancing the MAS's user support capabilities. Here is detailed documentation for implementing the Help and Documentation Agent, including its role, BDI components, and how it fits into the goal-oriented business development and operation multi-agent system SaaS platform. It includes the requested PlantUML diagrams and a detailed explanation of the Help and Documentation Agent's code.

### Role and Purpose:

The Help and Documentation Agent is responsible for providing users with access to help resources and documentation within the MAS. It plays a crucial role in enhancing user support by retrieving and displaying relevant help content based on user requests.

        self.add_plan(Plan("RetrieveHelpContentPlan", self.retrieve_help_content))
        self.add_plan(Plan("DisplayHelpContentPlan", self.display_help_content))

    def act(self):
        display_message(self.aid.name, "Acting in HelpAndDocumentationAgent")
        self.execute_plans()

    def on_message(self, message: ACLMessage):
        display_message(self.aid.name, f"Received message: {message.content}")
        if message.performative == ACLMessage.REQUEST:
            self.handle_help_request(message)

    def add_goal(self, goal):
        self.goals.append(goal)

    def add_belief(self, belief):
        self.beliefs.append(belief)

    def add_plan(self, plan):
        self.plans.append(plan)

    def execute_plans(self):
        for plan in self.plans:
            if plan.is_applicable(self.beliefs, self.goals):
                plan.execute()

    def retrieve_help_content(self):
        display_message(self.aid.name, "Retrieving help content")

        if help_request:
            help_content = self.fetch_help_content(help_request)
            self.add_belief(Belief("HelpContent", help_content))

    def display_help_content(self):

        help_content = self.get_belief("HelpContent")
        if help_content:
            self.show_help_content(help_content)

    def handle_help_request(self, message):
        content = message.content
        self.add_belief(Belief("HelpRequest", content))
        self.add_goal(Goal("ProcessHelpRequest", "Achieve"))

    def fetch_help_content(self, help_request):
        # Simulated help content retrieval
        help_database = {
            "general": "This is general help information.",
            "specific_feature": "This is help for a specific feature."
        }
        return help_database.get(help_request, "No help content available for this topic.")

    def show_help_content(self, help_content):
        # Simulated help content display
        display_message(self.aid.name, f"Showing help content: {help_content}")

    def get_belief(self, belief_name):
        for belief in self.beliefs:
            if belief.name == belief_name:
                return belief.value
        return None

```

### Implementation Details:

1. **Class Initialization**: The `HelpAndDocumentationAgent` class inherits from the base `Agent` class and initializes its beliefs, goals, and plans.
2. **Setup Method**: The `setup` method initializes the agent by adding the main goal "ProvideUserSupport" and two plans: "RetrieveHelpContentPlan" and "DisplayHelpContentPlan".
3. **Act Method**: The `act` method executes the agent's plans.
4. **Message Handling**: The `on_message` method processes incoming messages, specifically handling help requests.
5. **Goal Management**: The `add_goal` method adds goals to the agent's list of goals.
6. **Belief Management**: The `add_belief` method adds beliefs to the agent's list of beliefs.
7. **Plan Management**: The `add_plan` method adds plans to the agent's list of plans.
8. **Plan Execution**: The `execute_plans` method executes applicable plans based on the agent's beliefs and goals.
9. **Help Content Retrieval**: The `retrieve_help_content` method fetches relevant help content based on user requests.
10. **Help Content Display**: The `display_help_content` method presents help content to users.
11. **Request Handling**: The `handle_help_request` method processes incoming help requests.
12. **Content Fetching**: The `fetch_help_content` method simulates the retrieval of help content from a database.
13. **Content Display**: The `show_help_content` method simulates the display of help content to users.
14. **Belief Retrieval**: The `get_belief` method retrieves the value of a specified belief.
