### Implementation Details:

1. **Class Initialization**: The `OnboardingAgent` class inherits from the base `Agent` class and initializes its beliefs, goals, and plans.
2. **Setup Method**: The `setup` method initializes the agent by adding goals and plans.
3. **Act Method**: The `act` method executes the agent's plans.
4. **Message Handling**: The `on_message` method processes incoming messages and handles onboarding requests.
5. **Goal Management**: The `add_goal` method adds goals to the agent's list of goals.
6. **Belief Management**: The `add_belief` method adds beliefs to the agent's list of beliefs.
7. **Plan Management**: The `add_plan` method adds plans to the agent's list of plans.
8. **Plan Execution**: The `execute_plans` method executes applicable plans based on the agent's beliefs and goals.
9. **Onboarding Initiation**: The `initiate_onboarding` method starts the onboarding process by collecting necessary data.
10. **Onboarding Completion**: The `complete_onboarding` method finalizes the onboarding process using the collected data.
11. **Data Collection**: The `collect_onboarding_data` method simulates the collection of onboarding data.
12. **Finalization**: The `finalize_onboarding` method simulates the finalization of the onboarding process.
13. **Belief Retrieval**: The `get_belief` method retrieves the value of a specified belief.
