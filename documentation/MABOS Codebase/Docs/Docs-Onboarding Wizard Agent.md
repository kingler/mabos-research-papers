# Docs: Onboarding Wizard Agent

The OnboardingWizardAgent provides a guided onboarding process for new users within the user interface. It ensures a smooth and efficient onboarding experience, enhancing the MAS's user onboarding capabilities. Here is detailed documentation for implementing the Onboarding Wizard Agent, including its role, BDI components, and how it fits into the goal-oriented business development and operation multi-agent system SaaS platform. It includes the requested PlantUML diagrams and a detailed explanation of the Onboarding Wizard Agent's code.

### Role and Purpose:

        self.goals = []
        self.plans = []

    def setup(self):
        display_message(self.aid.name, "Setting up OnboardingWizardAgent")
        self.add_goal(Goal("FacilitateUserOnboarding", "Achieve"))
        self.add_plan(Plan("InitiateOnboardingPlan", self.initiate_onboarding))
        self.add_plan(Plan("GuideUserPlan", self.guide_user))
        self.add_plan(Plan("CompleteOnboardingPlan", self.complete_onboarding))

    def act(self):
        display_message(self.aid.name, "Acting in OnboardingWizardAgent")
        self.execute_plans()

    def on_message(self, message: ACLMessage):
        display_message(self.aid.name, f"Received message: {message.content}")
        if message.performative == ACLMessage.REQUEST:
            self.handle_onboarding_request(message)

    def add_goal(self, goal):

    def add_belief(self, belief):
        self.beliefs.append(belief)

    def add_plan(self, plan):
        self.plans.append(plan)

    def execute_plans(self):
        for plan in self.plans:
            if plan.is_applicable(self.beliefs, self.goals):
                plan.execute()

    def initiate_onboarding(self):
        display_message(self.aid.name, "Initiating onboarding process")
        onboarding_steps = self.define_onboarding_steps()
        self.add_belief(Belief("OnboardingSteps", onboarding_steps))

    def guide_user(self):
        display_message(self.aid.name, "Guiding user through onboarding steps")
        onboarding_steps = self.get_belief("OnboardingSteps")
        if onboarding_steps:
            for step in onboarding_steps:
                self.execute_onboarding_step(step)

    def complete_onboarding(self):
        display_message(self.aid.name, "Completing onboarding process")
        self.add_belief(Belief("OnboardingStatus", "Completed"))

    def handle_onboarding_request(self, message):
        content = message.content
        self.add_belief(Belief("OnboardingRequest", content))
        self.add_goal(Goal("ProcessOnboardingRequest", "Achieve"))

    def define_onboarding_steps(self):
        # Simulated onboarding steps definition
        return ["Step1: Introduction", "Step2: System Overview", "Step3: First Task"]

    def execute_onboarding_step(self, step):
        # Simulated onboarding step execution
        display_message(self.aid.name, f"Executing onboarding step: {step}")

    def get_belief(self, belief_name):
        for belief in self.beliefs:
            if belief.name == belief_name:
                return belief.value
        return None

```

### Implementation Details:

1. **Class Initialization**: The `OnboardingWizardAgent` class inherits from the base `Agent` class and initializes its beliefs, goals, and plans.
2. **Setup Method**: The `setup` method initializes the agent by adding the main goal "FacilitateUserOnboarding" and three plans: "InitiateOnboardingPlan", "GuideUserPlan", and "CompleteOnboardingPlan".
3. **Act Method**: The `act` method executes the agent's plans.
4. **Message Handling**: The `on_message` method processes incoming messages, specifically handling onboarding requests.
5. **Goal Management**: The `add_goal` method adds goals to the agent's list of goals.
6. **Belief Management**: The `add_belief` method adds beliefs to the agent's list of beliefs.
7. **Plan Management**: The `add_plan` method adds plans to the agent's list of plans.
8. **Plan Execution**: The `execute_plans` method executes applicable plans based on the agent's beliefs and goals.
9. **Onboarding Initialization**: The `initiate_onboarding` method defines onboarding steps and updates the agent's beliefs.
10. **User Guidance**: The `guide_user` method guides users through the defined onboarding steps.
11. **Onboarding Completion**: The `complete_onboarding` method finalizes the onboarding process and updates the agent's beliefs.
12. **Request Handling**: The `handle_onboarding_request` method processes incoming onboarding requests.
13. **Step Definition**: The `define_onboarding_steps` method simulates the definition of onboarding steps.
14. **Step Execution**: The `execute_onboarding_step` method simulates the execution of onboarding steps.
15. **Belief Retrieval**: The `get_belief` method retrieves the value of a specified belief.
