# Docs: System Schemas

This file defines the Pydantic schemas for system-related data structures used in our Multi-Agent System API. These schemas are essential for managing and monitoring the overall state of the MAS, including system configuration, performance metrics, and global operations.

In the context of our MAS, these schemas serve several critical functions:

1. They provide a structured way to represent and validate system-wide configuration settings.
2. They define the format for system status and performance metrics, enabling consistent monitoring and reporting.
3. They ensure that system-wide operations and updates are performed with properly structured and validated data.
4. They facilitate clear communication about the system's state between the MAS and external monitoring or management tools.

The schemas defined here include:

- SystemConfig: Represents the configurable settings of the MAS
- SystemStatus: Provides an overview of the current system state
- SystemMetrics: Defines the structure for various performance metrics of the MAS

These schemas are crucial for maintaining the overall health and performance of the MAS. They allow for standardized reporting of system status, consistent application of system-wide configurations, and structured collection of performance metrics. This standardization is essential for effective management, monitoring.

## 1. Overall Description and Purpose

This code defines the Pydantic model schemas for system-related data in the MABOS (Multi-Agent Based Optimization System) SaaS Platform. These schemas are used to validate and serialize/deserialize data related to system configuration, status, metrics, backups, and restore operations. The purpose of this module is to:

- Define the structure and types of data used for system-level operations and monitoring
- Provide input validation for API requests and responses related to system management
- Ensure consistency in system data representation across the application
- Facilitate automatic API documentation generation for system-related endpoints

The schemas cover various aspects of system management, including configuration, status reporting, performance metrics, and backup/restore operations.

## 3. Key Components

1. `SystemConfig`: Schema for system configuration settings
2. `SystemStatus`: Schema for current system status information
3. `SystemMetrics`: Schema for system performance metrics
4. `SystemBackup`: Schema for system backup information
5. `SystemRestore`: Schema for system restore operation parameters

## 4. Breakdown of Schemas

### SystemConfig

- Purpose: Define the schema for system configuration settings
- Fields:
    - `max_agents` (int): Maximum number of agents allowed in the system
    - `default_agent_type` (str): Default type for new agents
    - `logging_level` (str): System-wide logging level
    - `performance_tracking_interval` (int): Interval for tracking performance metrics (in seconds)

### SystemStatus

- Purpose: Define the schema for current system status information
- Fields:
    - `status` (str): Overall system status (e.g., 'running', 'paused', 'error')
    - `agent_count` (int): Current number of agents in the system
    - `active_models_count` (int): Number of active models in the system
    - `uptime` (float): System uptime in seconds
    - `current_load` (float): Current system load (0.0 to 1.0)

### SystemMetrics

- Purpose: Define the schema for system performance metrics
- Fields:
    - `cpu_usage` (float): Current CPU usage as a percentage
    - `memory_usage` (float): Current memory usage as a percentage
    - `active_connections` (int): Number of active connections
    - `messages_processed` (int): Total number of messages processed
    - `average_response_time` (float): Average response time for message processing (in milliseconds)

### SystemBackup

- Purpose: Define the schema for system backup information
- Fields:
    - `backup_id` (str): Unique identifier for the backup
    - `timestamp` (str): Timestamp of when the backup was created
    - `size` (int): Size of the backup in bytes
    - `description` (str): Brief description or notes about the backup

### SystemRestore

- Purpose: Define the schema for system restore operation parameters
- Fields:
    - `backup_id` (str): ID of the backup to restore from
    - `restore_options` (Dict[str, Any]): Options for the restore operation
- Includes an example configuration for API documentation

## 5. Key Python Libraries and Frameworks Used

1. `pydantic`: Used for defining data models with type annotations
2. `typing`: Used for type hinting, particularly for complex types like Dict[str, Any]

## 6. Usage Notes

- These schemas should be imported and used in API route definitions to specify request/response models for system-related operations
- They can also be used for data validation within the application logic
- The `SystemRestore` schema includes an example configuration, which can be used by API documentation tools

## 7. Important Notes on Usage, Configuration, and Future Improvements

Usage:

- Use these schemas in FastAPI route definitions to automatically validate request/response data for system management endpoints
- Utilize Pydantic's validation features for ensuring data integrity in system operations

Configuration:

- The schemas use Pydantic's default configuration
- Custom validators or configurations can be added as needed, especially for fields like `logging_level` or `status` which might benefit from predefined choices

Potential future improvements:

1. Implement more detailed validation for specific fields (e.g., enum for logging levels, range checks for usage percentages)
2. Add support for system-wide alerts or notifications schema
3. Implement schema for system logs or audit trails
4. Add support for distributed system configurations in case of multi-node deployments
5. Implement custom validators for complex system settings or metrics
6. Add support for system health checks or diagnostics schemas
7. Implement versioning for system schemas to handle evolution of system structures over time
8. Add support for system resource allocation or load balancing schemas
9. Implement serialization methods for different output formats (e.g., JSON, YAML, XML) if needed
10. Add support for system maintenance schedules or update schemas

Example Usage in FastAPI:

```python
from fastapi import APIRouter
from .system_schemas import SystemConfig, SystemStatus

router = APIRouter()

@router.get("/system/status", response_model=SystemStatus)
async def get_system_status():
    # Logic to get system status
    pass

@router.put("/system/config", response_model=SystemConfig)
async def update_system_config(config: SystemConfig):
    # Logic to update system configuration
    pass

```

This example shows how to use the SystemStatus and SystemConfig schemas for response serialization and input validation in FastAPI routes.

I've created comprehensive documentation for the System Schemas code you provided. This documentation follows a structure similar to the previous examples, adapted to fit the nature of Pydantic model schemas for system-related data. It includes an overall description, a PlantUML diagram showing the structure of the schemas, a description of key components, a breakdown of each schema, key Python libraries used, usage notes, and important notes on usage, configuration, and potential future improvements.

The documentation is formatted in Markdown for easy readability and includes PlantUML diagram code for the schema structure diagram. This should provide a clear and detailed guide for developers working with these system schemas within the MABOS SaaS Platform API.

Would you like me to explain or elaborate on any specific part of the documentation?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
