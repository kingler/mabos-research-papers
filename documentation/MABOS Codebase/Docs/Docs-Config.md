# Docs: Config

This file contains the configuration settings for our Multi-Agent System. It provides a centralized location for defining various parameters and options that control the behavior and operation of the MAS.

In the context of our MAS, this configuration file serves several important purposes:

1. It defines system-wide settings such as the maximum number of agents, default agent types, and performance tracking intervals.
2. It specifies database connection details, API settings, and other infrastructure-related configurations.
3. It sets up logging parameters to control how the system records events and errors.
4. It may include environment-specific settings, allowing the system to behave differently in development, testing, and production environments.

By centralizing these configuration options, we achieve several benefits:

- Easy modification of system behavior without changing code
- Ability to use different configurations for different environments
- Improved security by keeping sensitive information (like database credentials) separate from the code
- Easier maintenance and debugging by having all system parameters in one place

The configuration uses Python's built-in ConfigParser or environment variables, allowing for flexible configuration management across different deployment scenarios.
