# Docs: Knowledge Base Agent

The KnowledgeBaseAgent manages the system's knowledge base, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information. It integrates with other agents to provide knowledge-based services, enhancing the MAS's knowledge management capabilities. Here is detailed documentation for implementing the Knowledge Base Agent, including its role, BDI components, and how it fits into the goal-oriented business development and operation multi-agent system SaaS platform. It includes the requested PlantUML diagrams and a detailed explanation of the Knowledge Base Agent's code.

### Role and Purpose:

The Knowledge Base Agent is responsible for maintaining and providing access to the system's knowledge base.

### Detailed Code Explanation:

Here's a detailed explanation of the key components and methods for implementing the Knowledge Base Agent:

```python

from pade.acl.messages import ACLMessage
from pade.misc.utility import display_message
from models.goal_model import Goal
from models.belief_model import Belief
from models.plan_model import Plan

class KnowledgeBaseAgent(Agent):
    def __init__(self, aid):
        super(KnowledgeBaseAgent, self).__init__(aid)
        self.beliefs = []
        self.goals = []
        self.plans = []

    def setup(self):
        display_message(self.aid.name, "Setting up KnowledgeBaseAgent")
        self.add_goal(Goal("MaintainKnowledgeBase", "Maintain"))
        self.add_plan(Plan("UpdateKnowledgeBasePlan", self.update_knowledge_base))
        self.add_plan(Plan("ProvideKnowledgePlan", self.provide_knowledge))

    def act(self):
        display_message(self.aid.name, "Acting in KnowledgeBaseAgent")
        self.execute_plans()

    def on_message(self, message: ACLMessage):
        display_message(self.aid.name, f"Received message: {message.content}")
        if message.performative == ACLMessage.REQUEST:
            self.handle_knowledge_request(message)

    def add_goal(self, goal):
        self.goals.append(goal)

    def add_belief(self, belief):
        self.beliefs.append(belief)

    def add_plan(self, plan):
        self.plans.append(plan)

    def execute_plans(self):
        for plan in self.plans:
            if plan.is_applicable(self.beliefs, self.goals):
                plan.execute()

    def update_knowledge_base(self):
        display_message(self.aid.name, "Updating knowledge base")
        # Logic to update knowledge base
        updated_knowledge = self.fetch_latest_knowledge()
        self.add_belief(Belief("KnowledgeBase", updated_knowledge))

    def provide_knowledge(self):
        display_message(self.aid.name, "Providing knowledge to other agents")
        knowledge_request = self.get_belief("KnowledgeRequest")
        if knowledge_request:
            knowledge = self.retrieve_knowledge(knowledge_request)
            self.send_knowledge_response(knowledge)

    def handle_knowledge_request(self, message):
        content = message.content
        self.add_belief(Belief("KnowledgeRequest", content))
        self.add_goal(Goal("ProcessKnowledgeRequest", "Achieve"))

    def fetch_latest_knowledge(self):
        # Simulated knowledge fetching
        return {"Topic1": "Information1", "Topic2": "Information2"}

    def retrieve_knowledge(self, request):
        # Simulated knowledge retrieval
        knowledge_base = self.get_belief("KnowledgeBase")
        return knowledge_base.get(request, "No Information Available")

    def send_knowledge_response(self, knowledge):
        # Logic to send knowledge response to requesting agent
        pass

    def get_belief(self, belief_name):
        for belief in self.beliefs:
            if belief.name == belief_name:
                return belief.value
        return None

```

### Implementation Details:

1. **Class Initialization**: The `KnowledgeBaseAgent` class inherits from the base `Agent` class and initializes its beliefs, goals, and plans.
2. **Setup Method**: The `setup` method initializes the agent by adding the main goal "MaintainKnowledgeBase" and two plans: "UpdateKnowledgeBasePlan" and "ProvideKnowledgePlan".
3. **Act Method**: The `act` method executes the agent's plans.
4. **Message Handling**: The `on_message` method processes incoming messages, specifically handling knowledge requests.
5. **Goal Management**: The `add_goal` method adds goals to the agent's list of goals.
6. **Belief Management**: The `add_belief` method adds beliefs to the agent's list of beliefs.
7. **Plan Management**: The `add_plan` method adds plans to the agent's list of plans.
8. **Plan Execution**: The `execute_plans` method executes applicable plans based on the agent's beliefs and goals.
9. **Knowledge Base Update**: The `update_knowledge_base` method updates the knowledge base with new information.
10. **Knowledge Provision**: The `provide_knowledge` method retrieves and provides knowledge to other agents based on their requests.
11. **Knowledge Request Handling**: The `handle_knowledge_request` method processes incoming knowledge requests.
12. **Knowledge Fetching**: The `fetch_latest_knowledge` method simulates the fetching of the latest knowledge.
13. **Knowledge Retrieval**: The `retrieve_knowledge` method simulates the retrieval of knowledge based on a request.
14. **Knowledge Response**: The `send_knowledge_response` method (to be implemented) will send the retrieved knowledge to the requesting agent.
15. **Belief Retrieval**: The `get_belief` method retrieves the value of a specified belief.
