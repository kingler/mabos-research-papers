# Docs: Workbench Layout Agent

The WorkbenchLayoutAgent manages the layout and organization of the user interface workbench. It ensures a user-friendly and efficient workspace, enhancing the MAS's UI layout capabilities. Here is detailed documentation for implementing the Workbench Layout Agent, including its role, BDI components, and how it fits into the goal-oriented business development and operation multi-agent system SaaS platform. It includes the requested PlantUML diagrams and a detailed explanation of the Workbench Layout Agent's code.

### Role and Purpose:

The Workbench Layout Agent is responsible for managing the layout and organization of the user interface workbench. It ensures a user-friendly and efficient workspace by initializing and updating the layout based on user requests and system requirements. This agent enhances the MAS's UI layout capabilities, making it easier for users to interact with and manage their workspaces.

### BDI Components:

```python
from pade.core.agent import Agent
from pade.acl.messages import ACLMessage
from pade.misc.utility import display_message
from models.goal_model import Goal
from models.belief_model import Belief
from models.plan_model import Plan

class WorkbenchLayoutAgent(Agent):
    def __init__(self, aid):
        super(WorkbenchLayoutAgent, self).__init__(aid)
        self.beliefs = []
        self.goals = []
        self.plans = []

    def setup(self):
        display_message(self.aid.name, "Setting up WorkbenchLayoutAgent")
        self.add_goal(Goal("ManageUILayout", "Maintain"))
        self.add_plan(Plan("InitializeLayoutPlan", self.initialize_layout))
        self.add_plan(Plan("UpdateLayoutPlan", self.update_layout))

    def act(self):
        display_message(self.aid.name, "Acting in WorkbenchLayoutAgent")
        self.execute_plans()

    def on_message(self, message: ACLMessage):
        display_message(self.aid.name, f"Received message: {message.content}")
        if message.performative == ACLMessage.REQUEST:
            self.handle_layout_request(message)

    def add_goal(self, goal):
        self.goals.append(goal)

    def add_belief(self, belief):
        self.beliefs.append(belief)

    def add_plan(self, plan):
        self.plans.append(plan)

    def execute_plans(self):
        for plan in self.plans:
            if plan.is_applicable(self.beliefs, self.goals):
                plan.execute()

    def initialize_layout(self):
        display_message(self.aid.name, "Initializing UI layout")
        layout_data = self.setup_layout()
        self.add_belief(Belief("UILayoutData", layout_data))

    def update_layout(self):
        display_message(self.aid.name, "Updating UI layout")
        layout_data = self.get_belief("UILayoutData")
        if layout_data:
            updated_layout = self.modify_layout(layout_data)
            self.add_belief(Belief("UpdatedUILayout", updated_layout))

    def handle_layout_request(self, message):
        content = message.content
        self.add_belief(Belief("LayoutRequest", content))
        self.add_goal(Goal("ProcessLayoutRequest", "Achieve"))

    def setup_layout(self):
        # Simulated layout setup
        return {"Panels": ["Panel1", "Panel2"], "Positions": {"Panel1": "Left", "Panel2": "Right"}}

    def modify_layout(self, layout_data):
        # Simulated layout modification
        layout_data["Panels"].append("Panel3")
        layout_data["Positions"]["Panel3"] = "Bottom"
        return layout_data

    def get_belief(self, belief_name):
        for belief in self.beliefs:
            if belief.name == belief_name:
                return belief.value
        return None

```

### Implementation Details:

1. **Class Initialization**: The `WorkbenchLayoutAgent` class inherits from the base `Agent` class and initializes its beliefs, goals, and plans.
2. **Setup Method**: The `setup` method initializes the agent by adding the main goal "ManageUILayout" and two plans: "InitializeLayoutPlan" and "UpdateLayoutPlan".
3. **Act Method**: The `act` method executes the agent's plans.
4. **Message Handling**: The `on_message` method processes incoming messages, specifically handling layout requests.
5. **Goal Management**: The `add_goal` method adds goals to the agent's list of goals.
6. **Belief Management**: The `add_belief` method adds beliefs to the agent's list of beliefs.
7. **Plan Management**: The `add_plan` method adds plans to the agent's list of plans.
8. **Plan Execution**: The `execute_plans` method executes applicable plans based on the agent's beliefs and goals.
9. **Layout Initialization**: The `initialize_layout` method sets up the initial layout and updates the agent's beliefs.
10. **Layout Update**: The `update_layout` method updates the layout based on the current beliefs.
11. **Request Handling**: The `handle_layout_request` method processes incoming layout requests.
12. **Layout Setup**: The `setup_layout` method simulates the setup of the UI layout.
13. **Layout Modification**: The `modify_layout` method simulates the modification of the UI layout.
14. **Belief Retrieval**: The `get_belief` method retrieves the value of a specified belief.
