# Docs: API Dependencies

## 1. Overall Description and Purpose

This code defines crucial dependencies used across the MABOS (Multi-Agent Based Optimization System) SaaS Platform API. It primarily focuses on providing access to the MAS (Multi-Agent System) Manager instance and the database session . The purpose of this module is to:

- Ensure a single, globally accessible instance of the MAS Manager
- Provide a way to initialize the MAS Manager lazily (only when first requested)
- Offer a convenient method to access the database session
- Define these as FastAPI dependencies for easy injection into API routes

These dependencies are essential for maintaining consistency across the API and ensuring proper resource management.

## 2. Dependency Structure Diagram

```
@startuml
!define FASTAPI FastAPI

package "API Dependencies" {
    [get_mas_manager] as GMM
    [get_db] as GDB
}

[MASManager] as MAS
[Database Session] as DB

GMM --> MAS : creates/returns
GDB --> GMM : depends on
GDB --> DB : returns

```

## 3. Key Components

1. `_mas_manager`: A global variable to store the MASManager instance
2. `get_mas_manager()`: A dependency function to get or create the MASManager instance
3. `get_db()`: A dependency function to get the database session from the MASManager

## 4. Breakdown of Functions

### `get_mas_manager() -> MASManager`

- Purpose: Get or create the MASManager instance
- Implementation:
    - Uses a global variable `_mas_manager` to store the instance
    - If `_mas_manager` is None, creates a new MASManager and initializes it
    - Returns the MASManager instance
- Usage: Can be used as a FastAPI dependency in route definitions

### `get_db(mas_manager: MASManager = Depends(get_mas_manager))`

- Purpose: Get the database session from the MASManager
- Parameters:
    - `mas_manager`: An instance of MASManager, obtained using the `get_mas_manager` dependency
- Implementation: Returns the `db_session` attribute of the MASManager
- Usage: Can be used as a FastAPI dependency in route definitions to get the database session

## 5. Key Python Libraries and Frameworks Used

1. `fastapi`: Used for defining dependencies that can be injected into API routes
2. `typing`: Used for type hinting, particularly the `Optional` type
3. Custom modules: `mas.mas_manager` for the MASManager class

## 6. Usage Notes

- These dependencies should be imported and used in API route definitions
- `get_mas_manager` ensures that only one instance of MASManager is created and used throughout the application
- `get_db` provides a convenient way to access the database session in API routes

## 7. Important Notes on Usage, Configuration, and Future Improvements

Usage:

```python
from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends
from .dependencies import get_mas_manager, get_db

router = APIRouter()

@router.get("/agents")
async def get_agents(mas_manager = Depends(get_mas_manager), db = Depends(get_db)):
    # Use mas_manager and db in your route logic
    pass

```

**Configuration:**

- The MASManager initialization in `get_mas_manager` might need to be adjusted if the MASManager requires configuration parameters

Potential future improvements:

1. Add error handling for MASManager initialization failures
2. Implement a more sophisticated dependency injection system if needed
3. Add support for different database sessions (e.g., read-only, write-only)
4. Implement a caching mechanism for frequently accessed data
5. Add logging to track dependency usage and performance
6. Implement a cleanup mechanism to properly close resources when the application shuts down
7. Add support for asyncio context managers in the dependencies
8. Implement dependency overrides for testing purposes
9. Add support for scoped dependencies (e.g., request-scoped, application-scoped)
10. Implement a factory pattern for creating different types of MASManager instances if needed

Example of adding a new dependency:

```python
from typing import AsyncGenerator

async def get_message_broker(mas_manager: MASManager = Depends(get_mas_manager)) -> AsyncGenerator:
    broker = mas_manager.message_broker
    yield broker
    await broker.close()  # Ensure the broker is closed after use

```

This example shows how to add a new dependency for accessing a message broker, ensuring it's properly closed after use.
