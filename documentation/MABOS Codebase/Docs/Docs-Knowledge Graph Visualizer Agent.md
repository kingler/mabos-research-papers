### Implementation Details:

1. **Class Initialization**: The `KnowledgeGraphVisualizerAgent` class inherits from the base `Agent` class and initializes its beliefs, goals, and plans.
2. **Setup Method**: The `setup` method initializes the agent by adding the main goal "VisualizeKnowledgeGraph" and three plans: "CollectKnowledgeDataPlan", "GenerateKnowledgeGraphPlan", and "DisplayKnowledgeGraphPlan".
3. **Act Method**: The `act` method executes the agent's plans.
4. **Message Handling**: The `on_message` method processes incoming messages, specifically handling graph visualization requests.
5. **Goal Management**: The `add_goal` method adds goals to the agent's list of goals.
6. **Belief Management**: The `add_belief` method adds beliefs to the agent's list of beliefs.
7. **Plan Management**: The `add_plan` method adds plans to the agent's list of plans.
8. **Plan Execution**: The `execute_plans` method executes applicable plans based on the agent's beliefs and goals.
9. **Knowledge Data Collection**: The `collect_knowledge_data` method gathers knowledge data and updates the agent's beliefs.
10. **Knowledge Graph Generation**: The `generate_knowledge_graph` method creates a knowledge graph structure based on collected data.
11. **Knowledge Graph Display**: The `display_knowledge_graph` method visualizes the generated knowledge graph.
12. **Request Handling**: The `handle_graph_request` method processes incoming graph visualization requests.
13. **Data Gathering**: The `gather_knowledge_data` method simulates the collection of knowledge data.
14. **Graph Creation**: The `create_knowledge_graph` method simulates the creation of a knowledge graph structure.
15. **Graph Visualization**: The `show_knowledge_graph` method simulates the display of the knowledge graph.
16. **Belief Retrieval**: The `get_belief` method retrieves the value of a specified belief.
