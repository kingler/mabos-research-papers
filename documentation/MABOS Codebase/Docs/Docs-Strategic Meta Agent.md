# Docs: Strategic Meta Agent

The StrategicMetaAgent focuses on high-level strategic planning and decision-making within the MAS. It collaborates with other meta-agents to align the system's long-term goals, enhancing the MAS's strategic capabilities. Here is detailed documentation for implementing the Strategic Meta Agent, including its role, BDI components, and how it fits into the goal-oriented business development and operation multi-agent system SaaS platform. It includes the requested PlantUML diagrams and a detailed explanation of the Strategic Meta Agent's code.

### Role and Purpose:

The Strategic Meta Agent is responsible for developing, maintaining, and communicating long-term strategies for the entire multi-agent system. It plays a crucial role in analyzing the business environment, formulating strategic plans, and ensuring that these strategies are effectively communicated to and implemented by other agents in the system. This agent is essential for providing high-level direction and aligning the activities of all other agents towards common long-term objectives.

### Detailed Code Explanation:

Here's a detailed explanation of the key components and methods for implementing the Strategic Meta Agent:

```python
from pade.core.agent import Agent
from pade.acl.messages import ACLMessage
from pade.misc.utility import display_message
from models.goal_model import Goal
from models.belief_model import Belief
from models.plan_model import Plan

class StrategicMetaAgent(Agent):
    def __init__(self, aid):
        super(StrategicMetaAgent, self).__init__(aid)
        self.beliefs = []
        self.goals = []
        self.plans = []

    def setup(self):
        display_message(self.aid.name, "Setting up StrategicMetaAgent")
        self.add_goal(Goal("DevelopLongTermStrategy", "Achieve"))
        self.add_plan(Plan("AnalyzeEnvironmentPlan", self.analyze_environment))
        self.add_plan(Plan("FormulateStrategyPlan", self.formulate_strategy))
        self.add_plan(Plan("CommunicateStrategyPlan", self.communicate_strategy))

    def act(self):
        display_message(self.aid.name, "Acting in StrategicMetaAgent")
        self.execute_plans()

    def on_message(self, message: ACLMessage):
        display_message(self.aid.name, f"Received message: {message.content}")
        if message.performative == ACLMessage.INFORM:
            self.handle_environmental_update(message)

    def analyze_environment(self):
        display_message(self.aid.name, "Analyzing business environment")
        environmental_factors = self.gather_environmental_data()
        self.add_belief(Belief("EnvironmentalFactors", environmental_factors))

    def formulate_strategy(self):
        display_message(self.aid.name, "Formulating long-term strategy")
        strategy = self.develop_strategy()
        self.add_belief(Belief("LongTermStrategy", strategy))

    def communicate_strategy(self):
        display_message(self.aid.name, "Communicating strategy to other agents")
        strategy = self.get_belief("LongTermStrategy")
        if strategy:
            self.send_strategy_to_tactical_agents(strategy)

    def handle_environmental_update(self, message):
        content = message.content
        self.add_belief(Belief("EnvironmentalUpdate", content))
        self.add_goal(Goal("ReassessStrategy", "Achieve"))

    def gather_environmental_data(self):
        # Simulated environmental data gathering
        return {"MarketTrends": "Growth", "CompetitorActions": "Expansion", "TechnologicalChanges": "AI Adoption"}

    def develop_strategy(self):
        # Simulated strategy development
        return {"Focus": "Innovation", "Expansion": "Global Markets", "Investment": "R&D"}

    def send_strategy_to_tactical_agents(self, strategy):
        # Logic to communicate strategy to TacticalMetaAgents
        pass

    def get_belief(self, belief_name):
        for belief in self.beliefs:
            if belief.name == belief_name:
                return belief.value
        return None

```

### Implementation Details:

1. **Class Initialization**: The `StrategicMetaAgent` class inherits from the base `Agent` class and initializes its beliefs, goals, and plans.
2. **Setup Method**: The `setup` method initializes the agent by adding the main goal "DevelopLongTermStrategy" and three plans: "AnalyzeEnvironmentPlan", "FormulateStrategyPlan", and "CommunicateStrategyPlan".
3. **Act Method**: The `act` method executes the agent's plans.
4. **Message Handling**: The `on_message` method processes incoming messages, specifically handling environmental updates.
5. **Environment Analysis**: The `analyze_environment` method gathers and analyzes environmental data.
6. **Strategy Formulation**: The `formulate_strategy` method develops long-term strategies based on environmental analysis.
7. **Strategy Communication**: The `communicate_strategy` method disseminates strategies to relevant agents.
8. **Environmental Update Handling**: The `handle_environmental_update` method processes new environmental information and triggers strategy reassessment.
9. **Environmental Data Gathering**: The `gather_environmental_data` method simulates the collection of environmental data.
10. **Strategy Development**: The `develop_strategy` method simulates the creation of a long-term strategy.
11. **Strategy Dissemination**: The `send_strategy_to_tactical_agents` method (to be implemented) will communicate strategies to TacticalMetaAgents.
12. **Belief Retrieval**: The `get_belief` method retrieves the value of a specified belief.
