        self.goals = []
        self.plans = []

    def setup(self):
        display_message(self.aid.name, "Setting up IntegrationUIAgent")
        self.add_goal(Goal("ManageExternalIntegrations", "Maintain"))
        self.add_plan(Plan("ConnectExternalSystemPlan", self.connect_external_system))

        # Simulated connection establishment
        return {"SystemID": "ExternalSystem1", "Status": "Connected"}

    def perform_data_sync(self, connection_info):
        # Simulated data synchronization
        return {"SyncedData": "Data from " + connection_info["SystemID"]}

    def get_belief(self, belief_name):
        for belief in self.beliefs:
            if belief.name == belief_name:
                return belief.value
        return None

```

### Implementation Details:

1. **Class Initialization**: The `IntegrationUIAgent` class inherits from the base `Agent` class and initializes its beliefs, goals, and plans.
2. **Setup Method**: The `setup` method initializes the agent by adding the main goal "ManageExternalIntegrations" and two plans: "ConnectExternalSystemPlan" and "SynchronizeDataPlan".
3. **Act Method**: The `act` method executes the agent's plans.
4. **Message Handling**: The `on_message` method processes incoming messages, specifically handling integration requests.
5. **Goal Management**: The `add_goal` method adds goals to the agent's list of goals.
6. **Belief Management**: The `add_belief` method adds beliefs to the agent's list of beliefs.
7. **Plan Management**: The `add_plan` method adds plans to the agent's list of plans.
8. **Plan Execution**: The `execute_plans` method executes applicable plans based on the agent's beliefs and goals.
9. **External System Connection**: The `connect_external_system` method establishes a connection with an external system and updates the agent's beliefs.
10. **Data Synchronization**: The `synchronize_data` method synchronizes data with the connected external system.
11. **Request Handling**: The `handle_integration_request` method processes incoming integration requests.
12. **Connection Establishment**: The `establish_connection` method simulates the establishment of a connection with an external system.
13. **Data Synchronization**: The `perform_data_sync` method simulates the synchronization of data with the connected external system.
14. **Belief Retrieval**: The `get_belief` method retrieves the value of a specified belief.
