from models.belief_model import Belief
from models.plan_model import Plan

class MaintenanceAgent(Agent):
    def __init__(self, aid):
        super(MaintenanceAgent, self).__init__(aid)
        self.beliefs = []
        self.goals = []
        self.plans = []

    def setup(self):
        display_message(self.aid.name, "Setting up MaintenanceAgent")
        self.add_goal(Goal("PerformMaintenance", "Maintain"))
        self.add_plan(Plan("ScheduleMaintenancePlan", self.schedule_maintenance))
        self.add_plan(Plan("ExecuteMaintenancePlan", self.execute_maintenance))

    def act(self):
        display_message(self.aid.name, "Acting in MaintenanceAgent")
        self.execute_plans()

    def on_message(self, message: ACLMessage):
        display_message(self.aid.name, f"Received message: {message.content}")
        if message.performative == ACLMessage.REQUEST:
            self.handle_maintenance_request(message)

    def add_goal(self, goal):
        self.goals.append(goal)

    def add_belief(self, belief):
        self.beliefs.append(belief)

    def add_plan(self, plan):
        self.plans.append(plan)

    def execute_plans(self):
        for plan in self.plans:
            if plan.is_applicable(self.beliefs, self.goals):
                plan.execute()

    def schedule_maintenance(self):
        display_message(self.aid.name, "Scheduling maintenance tasks")
        maintenance_schedule = self.create_maintenance_schedule()
        self.add_belief(Belief("MaintenanceSchedule", maintenance_schedule))

    def execute_maintenance(self):
        display_message(self.aid.name, "Executing maintenance tasks")
        maintenance_schedule = self.get_belief("MaintenanceSchedule")
        if maintenance_schedule:
            self.perform_maintenance(maintenance_schedule)

    def handle_maintenance_request(self, message):
        content = message.content
        self.add_belief(Belief("MaintenanceRequest", content))
        self.add_goal(Goal("ProcessMaintenanceRequest", "Achieve"))

    def create_maintenance_schedule(self):
        # Simulated maintenance schedule creation
        return {"Task1": "Daily", "Task2": "Weekly"}

    def perform_maintenance(self, schedule):
        # Simulated maintenance task execution
        for task, frequency in schedule.items():
            display_message(self.aid.name, f"Performing {task} with frequency {frequency}")

    def get_belief(self, belief_name):
        for belief in self.beliefs:
            if belief.name == belief_name:
                return belief.value
        return None

```

### Implementation Details:

1. **Class Initialization**: The `MaintenanceAgent` class inherits from the base `Agent` class and initializes its beliefs, goals, and plans.
2. **Setup Method**: The `setup` method initializes the agent by adding the main goal "PerformMaintenance" and two plans: "ScheduleMaintenancePlan" and "ExecuteMaintenancePlan".
3. **Act Method**: The `act` method executes the agent's plans.
4. **Message Handling**: The `on_message` method processes incoming messages, specifically handling maintenance requests.
5. **Goal Management**: The `add_goal` method adds goals to the agent's list of goals.
6. **Belief Management**: The `add_belief` method adds beliefs to the agent's list of beliefs.
7. **Plan Management**: The `add_plan` method adds plans to the agent's list of plans.
8. **Plan Execution**: The `execute_plans` method executes applicable plans based on the agent's beliefs and goals.
9. **Maintenance Scheduling**: The `schedule_maintenance` method creates a maintenance schedule and adds it as a belief.
10. **Maintenance Execution**: The `execute_maintenance` method performs maintenance tasks based on the schedule.
11. **Request Handling**: The `handle_maintenance_request` method processes incoming maintenance requests.
12. **Schedule Creation**: The `create_maintenance_schedule` method simulates the creation of a maintenance schedule.
13. **Maintenance Performance**: The `perform_maintenance` method simulates the execution of maintenance tasks.
14. **Belief Retrieval**: The `get_belief` method retrieves the value of a specified belief.

- Provides analytics on system health trends and maintenance effectiveness.

## Scalability and Performance Considerations

- The agent is designed to handle maintenance for large-scale systems with multiple components.
- It uses efficient scheduling algorithms to manage complex maintenance schedules.
- The modular design allows for easy addition of new maintenance procedures and system components.
- Asynchronous processing is used where possible to improve responsiveness and throughput.

## Security and Compliance

- Implements role-based access control for maintenance operations.
