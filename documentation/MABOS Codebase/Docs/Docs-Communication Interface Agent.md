        self.add_goal(Goal("ManageCommunicationInterfaces", "Maintain"))
        self.add_plan(Plan("InitializeCommunicationInterfacePlan", self.initialize_communication_interface))
        self.add_plan(Plan("HandleUserMessagesPlan", self.handle_user_messages))

    def act(self):
        display_message(self.aid.name, "Acting in CommunicationInterfaceAgent")
        self.execute_plans()

    def on_message(self, message: ACLMessage):

        self.add_belief(Belief("CommunicationInterface", communication_interface))

    def handle_user_messages(self):

            user_messages = self.retrieve_user_messages(communication_interface)
            self.process_user_messages(user_messages)

    def handle_communication_request(self, message):
        content = message.content
        self.add_belief(Belief("CommunicationRequest", content))
        self.add_goal(Goal("ProcessCommunicationRequest", "Achieve"))

    def setup_communication_interface(self):
        # Simulated communication interface setup
        return {"InterfaceType": "Chat", "Status": "Active"}

    def retrieve_user_messages(self, communication_interface):
        # Simulated user message retrieval
        return ["Message1", "Message2"]

    def process_user_messages(self, messages):
        for message in messages:
            display_message(self.aid.name, f"Processing message: {message}")

    def get_belief(self, belief_name):
        for belief in self.beliefs:
            if belief.name == belief_name:
                return belief.value
        return None

```

### Implementation Details:

1. **Class Initialization**: The `CommunicationInterfaceAgent` class inherits from the base `Agent` class and initializes its beliefs, goals, and plans.
2. **Setup Method**: The `setup` method initializes the agent by adding the main goal "ManageCommunicationInterfaces" and two plans: "InitializeCommunicationInterfacePlan" and "HandleUserMessagesPlan".
3. **Act Method**: The `act` method executes the agent's plans.
4. **Message Handling**: The `on_message` method processes incoming messages, specifically handling communication requests.
5. **Goal Management**: The `add_goal` method adds goals to the agent's list of goals.
6. **Belief Management**: The `add_belief` method adds beliefs to the agent's list of beliefs.
7. **Plan Management**: The `add_plan` method adds plans to the agent's list of plans.
8. **Plan Execution**: The `execute_plans` method executes applicable plans based on the agent's beliefs and goals.
9. **Communication Interface Initialization**: The `initialize_communication_interface` method sets up the communication interface and updates the agent's beliefs.
10. **User Message Handling**: The `handle_user_messages` method retrieves and processes user messages.
11. **Request Handling**: The `handle_communication_request` method processes incoming communication requests.
12. **Communication Interface Setup**: The `setup_communication_interface` method simulates the setup of the communication interface.
13. **User Message Retrieval**: The `retrieve_user_messages` method simulates the retrieval of user messages.
14. **Message Processing**: The `process_user_messages` method processes the retrieved user messages.
15. **Belief Retrieval**: The `get_belief` method retrieves the value of a specified belief.

- The modular design allows for parallel processing of different communication tasks.
- Asynchronous communication is used where possible to improve responsiveness and throughput.

### Security and Compliance

- Implements role-based access control for communication data and interfaces.
- Maintains an audit trail of all communication requests and messages.
- Ensures compliance with data privacy regulations when handling user-related communication.
- Supports encryption of sensitive communication data during transmission and storage.

This architecture provides a robust and flexible foundation for the Communication Interface Agent, allowing it to effectively manage communication interfaces within the multi-agent system. The integration with other agents and external systems enhances its capability to provide comprehensive and user-friendly communication tools, thereby improving the overall user experience and system interaction.
