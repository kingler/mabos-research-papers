# Docs: Monitoring Agent

The MonitoringAgent continuously monitors the system's performance and health. It provides real-time insights and alerts for any issues, helping maintain system stability and performance within the MAS.

Here is detailed documentation for implementing the Monitoring Agent, including its role, BDI components, and how it fits into the goal-oriented business development and operation multi-agent system SaaS platform.

## Role and Purpose:

The Monitoring Agent is responsible for continuously observing and analyzing the system's performance, health, and various metrics. It collects data from different components of the system, analyzes this data to identify potential issues or anomalies, and raises alerts when necessary. This agent plays a crucial role in ensuring the overall stability, performance, and reliability of the multi-agent system.

### BDI Components:

### a. Beliefs:

- Current system metrics (CPU usage, memory usage, disk space, network traffic, etc.)
- Historical performance data
- Alert thresholds
- System health status
- External metric updates from other agents

### b. Desires:

- Maintain continuous monitoring of the system
- Ensure system stability and optimal performance
- Detect and alert on potential issues before they become critical
- Provide accurate and timely insights into system health

### c. Intentions:

- Collect system metrics regularly
- Analyze collected metrics to assess system health
- Handle and distribute alerts when issues are detected
- Process metric updates from external sources

### Goals:

- G1: Monitor System (Maintain goal)
- G2: Handle Alerts (Achieve goal)

### Plans:

- P1: CollectMetricsPlan
- P2: AnalyzeMetricsPlan
- P3: HandleAlertsPlan

### Actions:

- Collect various system metrics
- Analyze metrics against predefined thresholds
- Generate alerts for anomalies or issues
- Send alerts to appropriate agents or systems
- Update beliefs based on new metric data
- Process external metric updates

### Knowledge:

- System components and their normal operating parameters
- Performance benchmarks and thresholds
- Alert prioritization criteria
- Historical performance patterns
- Correlation between different metrics and system health

### PlantUML Diagrams:

### a. Workflow Diagram:

```
@startuml
|Monitoring Agent|
start
repeat
  :Collect System Metrics;
  :Analyze Metrics;
  if (Issues Detected?) then (yes)
    :Generate Alerts;
    :Send Alerts;
  else (no)
  endif
  :Update Beliefs;
repeat while (Continue Monitoring?) is (yes)
-> no;
stop
@enduml

```

Now, I'll provide the documentation for this Monitoring Agent:

### b. Goal Model (Using Activity Diagram):

```
@startuml
|Monitoring Agent|
start
fork
  :G1: Monitor System;
fork again
  :G2: Handle Alerts;
end fork
stop
@enduml

```

### c. Sequence Diagram (Interaction with other agents):

```
@startuml
participant "Monitoring Agent" as Mon
participant "System Component" as Sys
participant "Alert Handler" as Alert
participant "Performance Analyzer" as Perf

loop Every monitoring interval
    Mon -> Sys: Request metrics
    Sys --> Mon: Return current metrics
    Mon -> Mon: Analyze metrics
    alt Issues detected
        Mon -> Alert: Send alert
        Mon -> Perf: Send metrics for analysis
    end
end
Perf --> Mon: Send performance insights
Mon -> Mon: Update beliefs

### Detailed Code Explanation:

The provided code outlines the basic structure of the Monitoring Agent. Here's a detailed explanation of its components:

1. **Initialization and Setup:**
    - The agent initializes with empty lists for beliefs, goals, and plans, and a dictionary for metrics.
    - In the `setup` method, it adds an initial goal to monitor the system and three plans: for collecting metrics, analyzing metrics, and handling alerts.
2. **Action Execution:**
    - The `act` method is called periodically, executing the agent's plans based on its current beliefs and goals.
3. **Message Handling:**
    - The `on_message` method processes incoming messages, specifically handling metric updates from other agents.
4. **Plan Execution:**
    - The `execute_plans` method iterates through all plans, executing those that are applicable given the current beliefs and goals.
5. **Metric Collection:**
    - The `collect_metrics` method simulates the collection of system metrics, updating the agent's beliefs with the new data.
6. **Metric Analysis:**
    - The `analyze_metrics` method processes the collected metrics, performing analysis to detect any issues and potentially adding a goal to handle alerts.
7. **Alert Handling:**
    - The `handle_alerts` method processes any detected alerts, simulating the sending of these alerts to appropriate systems or agents.
8. **Continuous Monitoring:**
    - The `run` method implements a continuous monitoring loop, periodically executing the agent's act method.

### Implementation Details:

To fully implement this agent, consider the following enhancements:

1. Implement real metric collection mechanisms, possibly integrating with system monitoring tools or libraries.
2. Develop more sophisticated metric analysis algorithms, potentially incorporating machine learning for anomaly detection.
3. Implement a robust alerting system with different severity levels and notification methods.
4. Add support for dynamic thresholds that adapt based on historical data and system patterns.
5. Implement data storage for historical metrics to support trend analysis and reporting.
6. Develop visualization capabilities for system health and performance metrics.
7. Implement more detailed communication protocols with other agents for coordinated monitoring and issue resolution.
8. Add support for custom metrics and monitoring rules that can be defined by system administrators.

This implementation provides a foundation for the Monitoring Agent, allowing it to continuously monitor and maintain the health of the multi-agent system. The modular design allows for easy extension of its capabilities as the monitoring requirements grow in complexity.

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the Monitoring Agent, its role in the MABOS platform, and its implementation details. It covers the agent's BDI components, goals, plans, actions, and knowledge requirements. The included PlantUML diagrams illustrate the agent's workflow, goal model, and interactions with other agents. The detailed code explanation and implementation notes provide guidance for developers to implement and integrate this agent into the larger multi-agent system.
