# Docs: Constraint Solver

## 1. Overall Description and Purpose

This code defines a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) solver, which is a fundamental tool in artificial intelligence and operations research. The implementation includes two main classes:

1. `Constraint`: Represents a constraint in the CSP.
2. `ConstraintSolver`: Implements the solver using a backtracking search algorithm.

The purpose of this code is to provide a flexible and extensible framework for solving constraint satisfaction problems. It can be used in various applications, such as scheduling, resource allocation, and puzzle solving.

## 2. PlantUML Class Diagram

The following PlantUML diagram illustrates the structure of the Constraint Solver:

```
@startuml
class Constraint {
  - variables: List[str]
  - constraint_function: Callable[[Dict[str, int]], bool]
  + is_satisfied(assignment: Dict[str, int]): bool
}

class ConstraintSolver {
  - variables: List[str]
  - domains: Dict[str, List[int]]
  - constraints: List[Constraint]
  + add_variable(variable: str, domain: List[int])
  + add_constraint(constraint: Constraint)
  - is_consistent(variable: str, value: int, assignment: Dict[str, int]): bool
  + backtracking_search(): Dict[str, int]
  - _backtrack(assignment: Dict[str, int]): Dict[str, int]
  + solve(): Dict[str, int]
}

## 3. Data Schema Description

1. `Constraint` (Class):
    - `variables` (List[str]): List of variable names involved in the constraint
    - `constraint_function` (Callable[[Dict[str, int]], bool]): Function that evaluates the constraint
2. `ConstraintSolver` (Class):
    - `variables` (List[str]): List of all variables in the CSP
    - `domains` (Dict[str, List[int]]): Dictionary mapping each variable to its domain of possible values
    - `constraints` (List[Constraint]): List of all constraints in the CSP

## 4. Breakdown of Functions/Methods

### Constraint Class

### `__init__(self, variables: List[str], constraint_function: Callable[[Dict[str, int]], bool])`

- Purpose: Initialize a new Constraint object
- Parameters:
    - `variables` (List[str]): List of variable names involved in the constraint
    - `constraint_function` (Callable[[Dict[str, int]], bool]): Function that evaluates the constraint
- Return value: None
- Key logic: Stores the variables and constraint function

### `is_satisfied(self, assignment: Dict[str, int]) -> bool`

- Purpose: Check if the constraint is satisfied given an assignment
- Parameters:
    - `assignment` (Dict[str, int]): A dictionary mapping variables to their assigned values
- Return value: bool - True if the constraint is satisfied, False otherwise
- Key logic: Calls the constraint function with the given assignment

### ConstraintSolver Class

### `__init__(self)`

- Purpose: Initialize a new ConstraintSolver object
- Parameters: None
- Return value: None
- Key logic: Initializes empty lists/dictionaries for variables, domains, and constraints

### `add_variable(self, variable: str, domain: List[int])`

- Purpose: Add a new variable to the CSP
- Parameters:
    - `variable` (str): The name of the variable
    - `domain` (List[int]): The list of possible values for the variable
- Return value: None
- Key logic: Adds the variable to the variables list and its domain to the domains dictionary

### `add_constraint(self, constraint: Constraint)`

- Purpose: Add a new constraint to the CSP
- Parameters:
    - `constraint` (Constraint): The constraint to add
- Return value: None
- Key logic: Adds the constraint to the constraints list

### `is_consistent(self, variable: str, value: int, assignment: Dict[str, int]) -> bool`

- Purpose: Check if assigning a value to a variable is consistent with the current assignment
- Parameters:
    - `variable` (str): The variable to assign
    - `value` (int): The value to assign to the variable
    - `assignment` (Dict[str, int]): The current partial assignment
- Return value: bool - True if the assignment is consistent, False otherwise
- Key logic: Checks if all relevant constraints are satisfied with the new assignment

### `backtracking_search(self) -> Dict[str, int]`

- Purpose: Perform a backtracking search to find a solution
- Parameters: None
- Return value: Dict[str, int] - A complete assignment that satisfies all constraints, or None if no solution exists
- Key logic: Initiates the backtracking search with an empty assignment

### `_backtrack(self, assignment: Dict[str, int]) -> Dict[str, int]`

- Purpose: Recursive helper function for backtracking search
- Parameters:
    - `assignment` (Dict[str, int]): The current partial assignment
- Return value: Dict[str, int] - A complete assignment that satisfies all constraints, or None if no solution exists
- Key logic: Implements the backtracking algorithm, trying values for unassigned variables

### `solve(self) -> Dict[str, int]`

- Purpose: Solve the CSP and return the solution
- Parameters: None
- Return value: Dict[str, int] - A complete assignment that satisfies all constraints, or None if no solution exists
- Key logic: Calls the backtracking search and prints the result

## 5. Key Python Libraries Used

The code primarily uses Python's built-in features and the `typing` module for type hinting:

1. `typing`: Used for type hinting, improving code readability and enabling better static type checking. Specifically, it uses `Dict`, `List`, and `Callable`.

## 6. Other Class Imports and Their Relationships

This code doesn't import any other custom classes. It is self-contained but designed to be used within a larger system that needs to solve constraint satisfaction problems.

## 7. Important Notes on Usage, Limitations, and Future Improvements

Usage:

- Create an instance of `ConstraintSolver`.
- Add variables and their domains using `add_variable()`.
- Create `Constraint` objects and add them to the solver using `add_constraint()`.
- Call the `solve()` method to find a solution.

Limitations:

- The current implementation assumes integer domains for variables.
- The backtracking algorithm may be inefficient for large or complex problems.
- There's no support for optimization problems (only satisfaction).

Potential future improvements:

1. Implement more advanced CSP algorithms, such as AC-3 for arc consistency or forward checking.
2. Add support for different variable types (e.g., floating-point numbers, strings).
3. Implement heuristics for variable and value ordering to improve efficiency.
4. Add support for optimization problems (e.g., branch and bound algorithm).
5. Implement parallel or distributed solving for large-scale problems.
6. Add support for soft constraints or weighted CSPs.
7. Implement explanation generation for unsolvable problems.
8. Add visualization tools for the search process and solution.
9. Implement incremental solving for dynamic CSPs.
10. Add support for global constraints for improved efficiency in specific problem types.
