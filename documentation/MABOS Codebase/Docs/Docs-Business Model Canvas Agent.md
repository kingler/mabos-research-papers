# Docs: Business Model Canvas Agent

The BusinessModelCanvasAgent provides tools for creating, managing, and visualizing business model canvases within the user interface. It enhances strategic planning and business modeling, improving the MAS's business modeling capabilities. Here is detailed documentation for implementing the Business Model Canvas Agent, including its role, BDI components, and how it fits into the goal-oriented business development and operation multi-agent system SaaS platform. It includes the requested PlantUML diagrams and a detailed explanation of the Business Model Canvas Agent's code.

### Role and Purpose:

The Business Model Canvas Agent is responsible for facilitating the creation, management, and visualization of business model canvases within the MAS. It plays a crucial role in strategic planning and business modeling by providing tools that help users conceptualize and document their business models. This agent ensures that users can easily create, modify, and visualize their business model canvases, thereby improving strategic decision-making and business planning.

### BDI Components:

### a. Beliefs:

- Current state of the business model canvas
- User requests for canvas creation and modification
- Available templates and components for the canvas
- System constraints and capabilities
- User preferences for canvas visualization

### b. Desires:

- Provide comprehensive tools for business model canvas creation and management
- Ensure canvases are accurate and informative
- Facilitate user interaction and customization
- Respond to canvas requests promptly
- Maintain a consistent and user-friendly interface

### c. Intentions:

- Create new business model canvases
- Edit existing business model canvases
- Visualize business model canvases
- Handle user requests for canvas management
- Update beliefs with new canvas data

### Detailed Code Explanation:

Here's a detailed explanation of the key components and methods for implementing the Business Model Canvas Agent:

```python

from pade.acl.messages import ACLMessage
from pade.misc.utility import display_message
from models.goal_model import Goal
from models.belief_model import Belief
from models.plan_model import Plan

class BusinessModelCanvasAgent(Agent):
    def __init__(self, aid):
        super(BusinessModelCanvasAgent, self).__init__(aid)
        self.beliefs = []
        self.goals = []
        self.plans = []

    def setup(self):
        display_message(self.aid.name, "Setting up BusinessModelCanvasAgent")
        self.add_goal(Goal("ManageBusinessModelCanvas", "Maintain"))
        self.add_plan(Plan("CreateCanvasPlan", self.create_canvas))
        self.add_plan(Plan("EditCanvasPlan", self.edit_canvas))
        self.add_plan(Plan("VisualizeCanvasPlan", self.visualize_canvas))

    def act(self):
        display_message(self.aid.name, "Acting in BusinessModelCanvasAgent")
        self.execute_plans()

    def on_message(self, message: ACLMessage):
        display_message(self.aid.name, f"Received message: {message.content}")
        if message.performative == ACLMessage.REQUEST:
            self.handle_canvas_request(message)

    def add_goal(self, goal):
        self.goals.append(goal)

    def add_belief(self, belief):
        self.beliefs.append(belief)

    def add_plan(self, plan):
        self.plans.append(plan)

    def execute_plans(self):
        for plan in self.plans:
            if plan.is_applicable(self.beliefs, self.goals):
                plan.execute()

    def create_canvas(self):
        display_message(self.aid.name, "Creating business model canvas")
        canvas_data = self.initialize_canvas()
        self.add_belief(Belief("CanvasData", canvas_data))

    def edit_canvas(self):
        display_message(self.aid.name, "Editing business model canvas")
        canvas_data = self.get_belief("CanvasData")
        if canvas_data:
            updated_canvas = self.modify_canvas(canvas_data)
            self.add_belief(Belief("UpdatedCanvas", updated_canvas))

    def visualize_canvas(self):
        display_message(self.aid.name, "Visualizing business model canvas")
        updated_canvas = self.get_belief("UpdatedCanvas")
        if updated_canvas:
            self.display_canvas(updated_canvas)

    def handle_canvas_request(self, message):
        content = message.content
        self.add_belief(Belief("CanvasRequest", content))
        self.add_goal(Goal("ProcessCanvasRequest", "Achieve"))

    def initialize_canvas(self):
        # Simulated business model canvas initialization
        return {"Sections": ["Key Partners", "Key Activities", "Value Propositions", "Customer Relationships", "Channels", "Customer Segments", "Cost Structure", "Revenue Streams"]}

    def modify_canvas(self, canvas_data):
        # Simulated business model canvas modification
        canvas_data["Value Propositions"].append("New Value Proposition")
        return canvas_data

    def display_canvas(self, canvas):
        # Simulated business model canvas display
        display_message(self.aid.name, f"Displaying business model canvas: {canvas}")

    def get_belief(self, belief_name):
        for belief in self.beliefs:
            if belief.name == belief_name:
                return belief.value
        return None

```

### Implementation Details:

1. **Class Initialization**: The `BusinessModelCanvasAgent` class inherits from the base `Agent` class and initializes its beliefs, goals, and plans.
2. **Setup Method**: The `setup` method initializes the agent by adding the main goal "ManageBusinessModelCanvas" and three plans: "CreateCanvasPlan", "EditCanvasPlan", and "VisualizeCanvasPlan".
3. **Act Method**: The `act` method executes the agent's plans.
4. **Message Handling**: The `on_message` method processes incoming messages, specifically handling canvas requests.
5. **Goal Management**: The `add_goal` method adds goals to the agent's list of goals.
6. **Belief Management**: The `add_belief` method adds beliefs to the agent's list of beliefs.
7. **Plan Management**: The `add_plan` method adds plans to the agent's list of plans.
8. **Plan Execution**: The `execute_plans` method executes applicable plans based on the agent's beliefs and goals.
9. **Canvas Creation**: The `create_canvas` method initializes a new business model canvas and updates the agent's beliefs.
10. **Canvas Editing**: The `edit_canvas` method modifies an existing business model canvas based on the current beliefs.
11. **Canvas Visualization**: The `visualize_canvas` method visualizes the business model canvas.
12. **Request Handling**: The `handle_canvas_request` method processes incoming canvas requests.
13. **Canvas Initialization**: The `initialize_canvas` method simulates the creation of a new business model canvas.
14. **Canvas Modification**: The `modify_canvas` method simulates the modification of an existing business model canvas.
15. **Canvas Display**: The `display_canvas` method simulates the display of the business model canvas.
16. **Belief Retrieval**: The `get_belief` method retrieves the value of a specified belief.
