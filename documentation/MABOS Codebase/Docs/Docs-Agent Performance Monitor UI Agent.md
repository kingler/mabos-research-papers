### Implementation Details:

1. **Class Initialization**: The `AgentPerformanceMonitorUIAgent` class inherits from the base `Agent` class and initializes its beliefs, goals, and plans.
2. **Setup Method**: The `setup` method initializes the agent by adding the main goal "MonitorAgentPerformance" and three plans: "CollectPerformanceDataPlan", "AnalyzePerformancePlan", and "VisualizePerformancePlan".
3. **Act Method**: The `act` method executes the agent's plans.
4. **Message Handling**: The `on_message` method processes incoming messages, specifically handling performance data messages.
5. **Goal Management**: The `add_goal` method adds goals to the agent's list of goals.
6. **Belief Management**: The `add_belief` method adds beliefs to the agent's list of beliefs.
7. **Plan Management**: The `add_plan` method adds plans to the agent's list of plans.
8. **Plan Execution**: The `execute_plans` method executes applicable plans based on the agent's beliefs and goals.
9. **Performance Data Collection**: The `collect_performance_data` method gathers performance metrics from other agents and updates the agent's beliefs.
10. **Performance Analysis**: The `analyze_performance` method analyzes the collected performance data and updates the agent's beliefs.
11. **Performance Visualization**: The `visualize_performance` method creates visual representations of the analyzed performance data.
12. **Performance Data Handling**: The `handle_performance_data` method processes incoming performance data messages.
13. **Performance Metrics Gathering**: The `gather_performance_metrics` method simulates the collection of performance metrics.
14. **Performance Analysis**: The `perform_analysis` method simulates the analysis of performance data.
15. **Visualization Creation**: The `create_visualization` method simulates the creation of performance visualizations.
16. **Belief Retrieval**: The `get_belief` method retrieves the value of a specified belief.
