# Docs: Situation Designer

## 1. Overall Description and Purpose

This code implements a Situation Designer system, which is used for creating, managing, and applying situation-based logic in a multi-agent or context-aware system. It consists of four main classes:

1. `Condition`: Represents a condition that can be evaluated in a given context.
2. `Action`: Represents an action that can be executed in a given context.
3. `Situation`: Represents a situation with conditions and associated actions.
4. `SituationDesigner`: Manages a collection of situations and provides methods for applying them and import/export functionality.

The purpose of this code is to provide a flexible and extensible framework for defining and managing context-dependent behaviors. It can be used in various applications such as:

- Adaptive systems
- Context-aware applications
- Rule-based expert systems
- Scenario planning and management
- Any domain where complex, context-dependent logic needs to be modeled and executed

## 2. PlantUML Class Diagram

The following PlantUML diagram illustrates the structure of the Situation Designer system:

```
@startuml
class Condition {
  - name: str
  - check_function: Callable[[Dict[str, Any]], bool]
  + evaluate(context: Dict[str, Any]): bool
  + __str__(): str
}

class Action {
  - name: str
  - execute_function: Callable[[Dict[str, Any]], None]
  + execute(context: Dict[str, Any])
  + __str__(): str
}

class Situation {
  - name: str
  - description: str
  - conditions: List[Condition]
  - actions: List[Action]
  + add_condition(condition: Condition)
  + add_action(action: Action)
  + is_applicable(context: Dict[str, Any]): bool
  + apply(context: Dict[str, Any])
  + __str__(): str
}

class SituationDesigner {
  - situations: List[Situation]
  + create_situation(name: str, description: str): Situation
  + get_applicable_situations(context: Dict[str, Any]): List[Situation]
  + apply_situations(context: Dict[str, Any])
  + export_to_json(filename: str)
  + import_from_json(filename: str, condition_map: Dict[str, Condition], action_map: Dict[str, Action])
}

## 5. Key Python Libraries Used

1. `typing`: Used for type hinting, improving code readability and enabling better static type checking.
2. `json`: Used for JSON serialization and deserialization in the export and import methods.

## 6. Other Class Imports and Their Relationships

This code doesn't import any other custom classes. It is self-contained and designed to be used within a larger system that needs to manage context-dependent behaviors.

## 7. Important Notes on Usage, Limitations, and Future Improvements

Usage:

- Create a `SituationDesigner` instance to manage situations.
- Define `Condition` and `Action` objects with appropriate check and execute functions.
- Use `create_situation()` to create new situations and add conditions and actions to them.
- Use `apply_situations()` to evaluate and apply situations in a given context.
- Use `export_to_json()` and `import_from_json()` for persistence and sharing of situation definitions.

Limitations:

- The current implementation doesn't support priority or ordering of situations or actions.
- There's no built-in mechanism for handling conflicts between situations or actions.
- The JSON export/import doesn't include the actual logic of conditions and actions, only their names.

Potential future improvements:

1. Implement a priority system for situations and actions.
2. Add support for more complex condition logic (e.g., OR, NOT operations).
3. Implement a mechanism for handling conflicts between situations or actions.
4. Add support for parameterized conditions and actions.
5. Implement a more sophisticated context model, possibly with type checking.
6. Add support for situation templates or inheritance.
7. Implement a domain-specific language for defining situations, conditions, and actions.
8. Add support for tracking situation history and transitions.
9. Implement a visualization tool for situation networks and transitions.
10. Add support for dynamic creation and modification of situations at runtime.

Example Usage:

```python
designer = SituationDesigner()

# Define conditions
high_cpu_condition = Condition("HighCPU", lambda context: context.get("cpu_usage", 0) > 80)
low_memory_condition = Condition("LowMemory", lambda context: context.get("available_memory", 100) < 20)

# Define actions
optimize_cpu_action = Action("OptimizeCPU", lambda context: print("Optimizing CPU usage..."))
free_memory_action = Action("FreeMemory", lambda context: print("Freeing up memory..."))

# Create situations
high_load_situation = designer.create_situation("HighLoad", "System is under high load")
high_load_situation.add_condition(high_cpu_condition)
high_load_situation.add_action(optimize_cpu_action)

low_resources_situation = designer.create_situation("LowResources", "System resources are running low")
low_resources_situation.add_condition(low_memory_condition)
low_resources_situation.add_action(free_memory_action)

# Apply situations
context = {"cpu_usage": 90, "available_memory": 15}
designer.apply_situations(context)

```

This example demonstrates how to create a situation designer, define conditions and actions, create situations, and apply them in a given context. It shows the basic usage of the SituationDesigner system to model and execute context-dependent behaviors.
