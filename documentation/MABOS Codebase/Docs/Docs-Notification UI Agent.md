# Docs: Notification UI Agent

The NotificationUIAgent manages notifications and alerts within the user interface. It ensures that users are informed of important events and changes, enhancing the MAS's notification capabilities. Here is detailed documentation for implementing the Notification UI Agent, including its role, BDI components, and how it fits into the goal-oriented business development and operation multi-agent system SaaS platform. It includes the requested PlantUML diagrams and a detailed explanation of the Notification UI Agent's code.

### Role and Purpose:

The Notification UI Agent is responsible for managing notifications and alerts within the MAS. It ensures that users are promptly informed of important events and changes, enhancing their ability to respond quickly and effectively. This agent processes incoming notifications, prioritizes them, and displays them to users in a clear and informative manner.

### BDI Components:

### a. Beliefs:

- Current pending notifications
- Processed notifications
- User preferences for notifications
- System constraints and capabilities
- Historical notification data

### b. Desires:

### Detailed Code Explanation:

Here's a detailed explanation of the key components and methods for implementing the Notification UI Agent:

```python
from pade.core.agent import Agent
from pade.acl.messages import ACLMessage
from pade.misc.utility import display_message
from models.goal_model import Goal
from models.belief_model import Belief
from models.plan_model import Plan

class NotificationUIAgent(Agent):
    def __init__(self, aid):
        super(NotificationUIAgent, self).__init__(aid)
        self.beliefs = []
        self.goals = []
        self.plans = []

    def setup(self):
        display_message(self.aid.name, "Setting up NotificationUIAgent")
        self.add_goal(Goal("ManageNotifications", "Maintain"))
        self.add_plan(Plan("ProcessNotificationPlan", self.process_notification))
        self.add_plan(Plan("DisplayNotificationPlan", self.display_notification))

    def act(self):
        display_message(self.aid.name, "Acting in NotificationUIAgent")
        self.execute_plans()

    def on_message(self, message: ACLMessage):
        display_message(self.aid.name, f"Received message: {message.content}")
        if message.performative == ACLMessage.INFORM:
            self.handle_notification_message(message)

    def add_goal(self, goal):
        self.goals.append(goal)

    def add_belief(self, belief):
        self.beliefs.append(belief)

    def add_plan(self, plan):
        self.plans.append(plan)

    def execute_plans(self):
        for plan in self.plans:
            if plan.is_applicable(self.beliefs, self.goals):
                plan.execute()

    def process_notification(self):
        display_message(self.aid.name, "Processing notification")
        notification = self.get_belief("PendingNotification")
        if notification:
            processed_notification = self.prioritize_notification(notification)
            self.add_belief(Belief("ProcessedNotification", processed_notification))

    def display_notification(self):
        display_message(self.aid.name, "Displaying notification")
        processed_notification = self.get_belief("ProcessedNotification")
        if processed_notification:
            self.show_notification(processed_notification)

    def handle_notification_message(self, message):
        content = message.content
        self.add_belief(Belief("PendingNotification", content))
        self.add_goal(Goal("ProcessNewNotification", "Achieve"))

    def prioritize_notification(self, notification):
        # Simulated notification prioritization
        priority = "High" if "urgent" in notification.lower() else "Normal"
        return {"content": notification, "priority": priority}

    def show_notification(self, notification):
        # Simulated notification display
        display_message(self.aid.name, f"Showing {notification['priority']} priority notification: {notification['content']}")

    def get_belief(self, belief_name):
        for belief in self.beliefs:
            if belief.name == belief_name:
                return belief.value
        return None

```

### Implementation Details:

1. **Class Initialization**: The `NotificationUIAgent` class inherits from the base `Agent` class and initializes its beliefs, goals, and plans.
2. **Setup Method**: The `setup` method initializes the agent by adding the main goal "ManageNotifications" and two plans: "ProcessNotificationPlan" and "DisplayNotificationPlan".
3. **Act Method**: The `act` method executes the agent's plans.
4. **Message Handling**: The `on_message` method processes incoming messages, specifically handling notification messages.
5. **Goal Management**: The `add_goal` method adds goals to the agent's list of goals.
6. **Belief Management**: The `add_belief` method adds beliefs to the agent's list of beliefs.
7. **Plan Management**: The `add_plan` method adds plans to the agent's list of plans.
8. **Plan Execution**: The `execute_plans` method executes applicable plans based on the agent's beliefs and goals.
9. **Notification Processing**: The `process_notification` method processes pending notifications and updates the agent's beliefs.
10. **Notification Display**: The `display_notification` method displays processed notifications to users.
11. **Notification Handling**: The `handle_notification_message` method processes incoming notification messages.
12. **Notification Prioritization**: The `prioritize_notification` method simulates the prioritization of notifications.
13. **Notification Display**: The `show_notification` method simulates the display of notifications.
14. **Belief Retrieval**: The `get_belief` method retrieves the value of a specified belief.
