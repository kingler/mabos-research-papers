# Docs: Environment Visualization Agent

The EnvironmentVisualizationAgent visualizes environmental data and factors affecting the system. It enhances situational awareness and decision-making, improving the MAS's environmental monitoring capabilities. Here is detailed documentation for implementing the Environment Visualization Agent, including its role, BDI components, and how it fits into the goal-oriented business development and operation multi-agent system SaaS platform. It includes the requested PlantUML diagrams and a detailed explanation of the Environment Visualization Agent's code.

### Role and Purpose:

The Environment Visualization Agent is responsible for collecting and visualizing environmental data within the MAS. It enhances situational awareness and decision-making by providing clear and informative visual representations of environmental factors affecting the system.

class EnvironmentVisualizationAgent(Agent):
    def __init__(self, aid):
        super(EnvironmentVisualizationAgent, self).__init__(aid)
        self.beliefs = []
        self.goals = []
        self.plans = []

    def setup(self):
        display_message(self.aid.name, "Setting up EnvironmentVisualizationAgent")
        self.add_goal(Goal("VisualizeEnvironment", "Maintain"))
        self.add_plan(Plan("CollectEnvironmentalDataPlan", self.collect_environmental_data))
        self.add_plan(Plan("VisualizeEnvironmentalDataPlan", self.visualize_environmental_data))

    def act(self):
        display_message(self.aid.name, "Acting in EnvironmentVisualizationAgent")
        self.execute_plans()

    def on_message(self, message: ACLMessage):
        display_message(self.aid.name, f"Received message: {message.content}")
        if message.performative == ACLMessage.REQUEST:
            self.handle_visualization_request(message)

    def add_goal(self, goal):
        self.goals.append(goal)

    def add_belief(self, belief):
        self.beliefs.append(belief)

    def add_plan(self, plan):
        self.plans.append(plan)

    def execute_plans(self):
        for plan in self.plans:
            if plan.is_applicable(self.beliefs, self.goals):
                plan.execute()

    def collect_environmental_data(self):
        display_message(self.aid.name, "Collecting environmental data")
        # Logic to collect environmental data
        environmental_data = self.gather_environmental_data()
        self.add_belief(Belief("EnvironmentalData", environmental_data))

    def visualize_environmental_data(self):
        display_message(self.aid.name, "Visualizing environmental data")
        environmental_data = self.get_belief("EnvironmentalData")
        if environmental_data:
            self.display_environmental_data(environmental_data)

    def handle_visualization_request(self, message):
        content = message.content
        self.add_belief(Belief("VisualizationRequest", content))
        self.add_goal(Goal("ProcessVisualizationRequest", "Achieve"))

    def gather_environmental_data(self):
        # Simulated environmental data collection
        return {"Temperature": 25, "Humidity": 60, "AirQuality": "Good"}

    def display_environmental_data(self, data):
        # Simulated environmental data visualization
        display_message(self.aid.name, f"Displaying environmental data: {data}")

    def get_belief(self, belief_name):
        for belief in self.beliefs:
            if belief.name == belief_name:
                return belief.value
        return None

```

### Implementation Details:

1. **Class Initialization**: The `EnvironmentVisualizationAgent` class inherits from the base `Agent` class and initializes its beliefs, goals, and plans.
2. **Setup Method**: The `setup` method initializes the agent by adding the main goal "VisualizeEnvironment" and two plans: "CollectEnvironmentalDataPlan" and "VisualizeEnvironmentalDataPlan".
3. **Act Method**: The `act` method executes the agent's plans.
4. **Message Handling**: The `on_message` method processes incoming messages, specifically handling visualization requests.
5. **Goal Management**: The `add_goal` method adds goals to the agent's list of goals.
6. **Belief Management**: The `add_belief` method adds beliefs to the agent's list of beliefs.
7. **Plan Management**: The `add_plan` method adds plans to the agent's list of plans.
8. **Plan Execution**: The `execute_plans` method executes applicable plans based on the agent's beliefs and goals.
9. **Environmental Data Collection**: The `collect_environmental_data` method gathers relevant environmental data.
10. **Environmental Data Visualization**: The `visualize_environmental_data` method creates visual representations of the collected environmental data.
11. **Request Handling**: The `handle_visualization_request` method processes incoming visualization requests.
12. **Data Gathering**: The `gather_environmental_data` method simulates the collection of environmental data.
13. **Data Display**: The `display_environmental_data` method simulates the visualization of environmental data.
14. **Belief Retrieval**: The `get_belief` method retrieves the value of a specified belief.
