# Docs: Reactive Agent

The ReactiveAgent responds to events and changes in real-time. It ensures that the system adapts quickly to new conditions, enhancing the MAS's responsiveness and agility. Here is detailed documentation for implementing the Reactive Agent, including its role, BDI components, and how it fits into the goal-oriented business development and operation multi-agent system SaaS platform. It includes the requested PlantUML diagrams and a detailed explanation of the Reactive Agent's code.

        self.goals = []
        self.plans = []

    def setup(self):
        display_message(self.aid.name, "Setting up ReactiveAgent")
        self.add_goal(Goal("RespondToEvents", "Maintain"))
        self.add_plan(Plan("MonitorEventsPlan", self.monitor_events))
        self.add_plan(Plan("HandleEventPlan", self.handle_event))

    def act(self):
        display_message(self.aid.name, "Acting in ReactiveAgent")
        self.execute_plans()

    def on_message(self, message: ACLMessage):
        display_message(self.aid.name, f"Received message: {message.content}")
        if message.performative == ACLMessage.INFORM:
            self.handle_event_notification(message)

    def add_goal(self, goal):
        self.goals.append(goal)

    def add_belief(self, belief):
        self.beliefs.append(belief)

    def add_plan(self, plan):
        self.plans.append(plan)

    def execute_plans(self):
        for plan in self.plans:
            if plan.is_applicable(self.beliefs, self.goals):
                plan.execute()

    def monitor_events(self):
        display_message(self.aid.name, "Monitoring system events")
        events = self.check_for_events()
        if events:
            self.add_belief(Belief("NewEvents", events))
            self.add_goal(Goal("HandleNewEvents", "Achieve"))

    def handle_event(self):
        display_message(self.aid.name, "Handling new events")
        events = self.get_belief("NewEvents")
        for event in events:
            response = self.determine_response(event)
            self.execute_response(response)

    def handle_event_notification(self, message):
        content = message.content
        self.add_belief(Belief("EventNotification", content))
        self.add_goal(Goal("ProcessEventNotification", "Achieve"))

    def check_for_events(self):
        # Simulated event checking
        return ["SystemOverload", "NetworkDisruption"]

    def determine_response(self, event):
        # Simulated response determination
        responses = {
            "SystemOverload": "ActivateLoadBalancing",
            "NetworkDisruption": "SwitchToBackupNetwork"
        }
        return responses.get(event, "LogAndMonitor")

    def execute_response(self, response):
        display_message(self.aid.name, f"Executing response: {response}")
        # Logic to execute the response

    def get_belief(self, belief_name):
        for belief in self.beliefs:
            if belief.name == belief_name:
                return belief.value
        return None

```

### Implementation Details:

1. **Class Initialization**: The `ReactiveAgent` class inherits from the base `Agent` class and initializes its beliefs, goals, and plans.
2. **Setup Method**: The `setup` method initializes the agent by adding the main goal "RespondToEvents" and two plans: "MonitorEventsPlan" and "HandleEventPlan".
3. **Act Method**: The `act` method executes the agent's plans.
4. **Message Handling**: The `on_message` method processes incoming messages, specifically handling event notifications.
5. **Goal Management**: The `add_goal` method adds goals to the agent's list of goals.
6. **Belief Management**: The `add_belief` method adds beliefs to the agent's list of beliefs.
7. **Plan Management**: The `add_plan` method adds plans to the agent's list of plans.
8. **Plan Execution**: The `execute_plans` method executes applicable plans based on the agent's beliefs and goals.
9. **Event Monitoring**: The `monitor_events` method checks for new events and updates the agent's beliefs and goals accordingly.
10. **Event Handling**: The `handle_event` method processes detected events and determines appropriate responses.
11. **Event Notification Processing**: The `handle_event_notification` method processes incoming event notifications from other agents.
12. **Event Checking**: The `check_for_events` method simulates the detection of system events.
13. **Response Determination**: The `determine_response` method decides on the appropriate response for a given event.
14. **Response Execution**: The `execute_response` method carries out the determined response action.
15. **Belief Retrieval**: The `get_belief` method retrieves the value of a specified belief.

@enduml

```

### Key Features and Capabilities

### a. Real-time Event Processing:

- The agent can process events as they occur, ensuring immediate response to system changes.
- It uses efficient event detection and classification mechanisms to handle high-frequency events.

### b. Adaptive Response Selection:

- Implements a flexible response determination system that can adapt to different types of events.
- Can be easily extended with new response strategies for emerging event types.

### c. Proactive Monitoring:

- Continuously monitors the system state to detect potential issues before they escalate.
- Can trigger preventive actions based on early warning signs.

### d. Seamless Integration:

- Integrates with other agents in the MAS to provide a comprehensive event handling system.
- Can coordinate with specialized agents (e.g., MaintenanceAgent) for complex response actions.

### e. Scalable Event Handling:

- Designed to handle a large number of events simultaneously without performance degradation.
- Can prioritize events based on their severity and potential impact on the system.

### Scalability and Performance Considerations

- The agent uses efficient data structures for quick event processing and response determination.
- It implements a priority queue for handling multiple events, ensuring critical events are addressed first.
- The modular design allows for easy distribution of event handling across multiple instances if needed.
- Asynchronous processing is used where possible to improve responsiveness and throughput.

### Security and Compliance

- Implements secure communication protocols for exchanging sensitive event information.
- Maintains an audit trail of all detected events and executed responses.
- Supports role-based access control for viewing and managing event responses.
- Ensures compliance with relevant industry standards for event handling and system monitoring.

This architecture provides a robust and flexible foundation for the Reactive Agent, allowing it to effectively monitor and respond to system events within the multi-agent system. The modular design enables easy updates and extensions to the agent's capabilities as new event types and response strategies are identified.
