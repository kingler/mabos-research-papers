You are tasked with analyzing the Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules (SBVR) documentation and applying its concepts to improve a business rules engine for a goal-oriented BDI multi-agent business operating system. Follow these steps carefully:

1. First, review the SBVR documentation provided:

<SBVR_DOCUMENTATION>
{{SBVR_DOCUMENTATION}}
</SBVR_DOCUMENTATION>

2. Analyze the SBVR documentation and extract key components related to business rules. Focus on:
   a) Core concepts and definitions
   b) Rule types and structures
   c) Vocabulary management
   d) Rule formulation and expression
   e) Semantic formulations
   f) Logical operations and quantifications

3. Now, examine the initial code provided:

<INITIAL_CODE>
{{INITIAL_CODE}}
</INITIAL_CODE>

4. Review the initial code and identify areas for improvement based on the SBVR concepts you've extracted. Consider:
   a) How the current code structure aligns with SBVR principles
   b) Ways to incorporate SBVR's approach to vocabulary and rule management
   c) Opportunities to enhance rule formulation and expression
   d) Potential for implementing semantic formulations
   e) Improvements in logical operations and quantifications

5. Based on your analysis of both the SBVR documentation and the initial code, recommend additional code or components needed to fully implement SBVR concepts in the business rules engine. Consider:
   a) New classes or modules for vocabulary management
   b) Structures for representing different rule types
   c) Methods for semantic formulations
   d) Implementations of logical operations and quantifications
   e) Interfaces for rule input and management

6. Provide your analysis and recommendations in the following format:

<analysis>
[Your detailed analysis of the SBVR documentation, including key extracted components and their relevance to the business rules engine]
</analysis>

<code_review>
[Your review of the initial code, highlighting areas for improvement based on SBVR concepts]
</code_review>

<recommendations>
[Your recommendations for additional code or components needed, with explanations of how they align with SBVR principles]
</recommendations>

Ensure your response is comprehensive, well-structured, and directly addresses the task of incorporating SBVR concepts into the business rules engine for the goal-oriented BDI multi-agent business operating system.
